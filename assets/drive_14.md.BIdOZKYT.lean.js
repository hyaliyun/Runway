Firstly, the reviewer singles out two specific actors, most likely referring to Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker, and commends their performances in the movie by describing them as \\"especially fine.\\" By focusing on the standout performances from these actors, the reviewer is appreciating the strengths of the movie. It can be inferred that these actors' roles and portrayal of their respective characters have left a positive impression on the reviewer. Moreover, the use of the phrase \\"especially fine\\" suggests that their acting was above average or beyond the reviewer's expectations. This further supports the idea that the reviewer found value in the movie, at least when it came to the acting department. Even though the review is quite short and does not delve into other aspects of the movie, such as plot, cinematography, or directing, it is evident that the reviewer appreciates the acting performances by Foster and Whitaker. Consequently, the overall opinion conveyed appears to be positive. In conclusion, the review exhibits a positive opinion of the movie, primarily focusing on the excellent performances delivered by Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker. Although other elements of the film are not considered in this brief review, the appreciation for outstanding acting suggests that the movie was memorable and enjoyable in at least one significant aspect."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. After the article, what will sportspeople probably consume?  A. Only protein supplements so they can eat whatever they want  B. not enough information  C. More foods that are higher in protein  D.

Choose from: + no. + yes.","output":"Yes, both questions have the same meaning, as both are asking about the measures being taken to protect and preserve Charminar. Charminar is a historical monument built in 1591 in Hyderabad, India. It plays a significant role in the region's cultural heritage and is an important symbol of the city. As such, efforts should be made to ensure its preservation. There are several steps that can be taken to protect and preserve Charminar: 1. Regular Maintenance and Restoration: Environmental factors, pollution, and natural decay can cause wear and damage to Charminar's structure. Regular inspections should be conducted to assess its condition, and timely maintenance and restoration work should be carried out to prevent further damage. This includes cleaning the monument and repairing the structural damages. 2. Control of Pollution: Air and noise pollution in the surrounding areas contribute to the deterioration of Charminar. By regulating vehicular traffic and setting up pollution control measures, authorities can limit the harmful effects of pollution on the monument. 3. Implementing Conservation Plans: Proper management and conservation plans need to be in place to address threats to the monument. These plans should include research, documentation, and conservation strategies, as well as engagement with local communities to create awareness. 4. Laws and Regulations: It is essential to enforce laws and regulations that prevent damage to the monument, such as restrictions on construction and industrial activities near Charminar. Strict penalties should be imposed on those who violate these laws to act as a deterrent. 5. Monitoring and Surveillance: Proper security measures, including the installation of CCTV cameras, should be taken to ensure that vandalism and illegal activities do not damage the monument. Security personnel should be present to monitor the site and safeguard it from potential threats. 6. Public Awareness and Education: Educating the public about the historical, cultural, and architectural significance of Charminar is essential. By incorporating the monument's history into school curricula and organizing educational programs, people are more likely to appreciate the importance of its preservation. 7. Encouraging Sustainable Tourism: Efforts should be made to promote responsible tourism around Charminar. Guidelines and codes of conduct for tourist behavior at the site can help minimize negative impacts, while still allowing visitors to enjoy the monument's rich history. 8. Collaborating with International Agencies: Collaboration with international organizations such as UNESCO, World Monuments Fund, and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) can enhance Charminar's preservation efforts by providing technical expertise, financial support, and best practices from other successful preservation projects around the world. Currently, some efforts are being made to protect and preserve Charminar. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has undertaken several restoration projects in the past to repair and maintain the monument. Additionally, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and the Hyderabad Traffic Police are working together to restrict vehicular traffic and reduce pollution within the Charminar pedestrian zone. Further steps, such as public engagement and sustainable tourism planning, can help strengthen these efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

And the sad truth is that \\"clothing mismatches\\" on the job can ruin the day of the person who is wearing the inappropriate attire --and the people with whom he or she comes in contact. Offices vary when it comes to dress codes. Some businesses have very high standards for their employees and set strict guidelines for office attire, while others maintain a more relaxed attitude. However, it is always important to remember that no matter what your company's attitude is regarding what you wear, you are working in a business environment and you should dress properly. Certain items may be more appropriate for evening wear than for a business meeting, just as shorts and a T-shirt are better suited for the beach than for an office environment. Your attire should reflect both your environment and your position. A senior vice president has a different image to maintain than that of a secretary or sales assistant.

You are given a new situation: Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk.  and a hint : Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  Please answer this question : Which brand requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk? The answer to this question is:","output":"The brand that requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk is Luchene, the organic milk brand. The reason for this is primarily due to the differences in organic and conventional milk production methods. Organic milk production typically involves giving cows a lower level of concentrates or supplemental feed, focusing more on roughage, such as grass, hay, and silage. This approach to feeding can result in lower milk production per cow compared to cows on conventional dairy farms, where concentrates, higher-energy feeds, and sometimes hormones are used to maximize milk production. Moreover, organic farming practices tend to limit the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in lower crop yields per hectare. This increased land use, combined with the lower milk production per cow, means that organic milk production generally necessitates a larger number of cows to produce the same amount of milk as a conventional dairy farm. So, in Jimmy's scenario, it is the Luchene brand that would require more cows to produce the same amount of milk compared to Jean's, the non-organic milk brand. It is important to note that this comparison only takes into consideration the milk production aspect, and not other factors such as animal welfare, environmental impact, or nutritional value, which may influence a consumer's decision when choosing between organic and conventional milk."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: what year did george bush name hank paulson secretary of treasury?

Review: overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The given movie review sentence, \\"overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man,\\" appears to be positive in nature. This statement focuses on the personal growth and transformation of a character, which typically reflects a favorable aspect of the film. The review suggests that the character successfully confronts and overcomes personal challenges, ultimately transforming into a better person. Such a transformation is usually seen as a satisfying and commendable arc for a character's development, indicating a positive evaluation of this aspect of the movie. Furthermore, the use of the term \\"good man\\" implies that the character not only undergoes a transformation but also becomes a more virtuous and admirable figure, further emphasizing the positive nature of the review. It should be noted, however, that this sentence is quite short and does not provide an exhaustive or comprehensive assessment of the entire film. As a single sentence, it offers a limited perspective, focusing primarily on the character development aspect of the movie. While this aspect appears to be positively evaluated, other elements of the film, such as its plot, direction, cinematography, or performances, might elicit additional positive or negative reactions from the reviewer. In summary, based on the focus on personal growth and transformation, the given movie review sentence seems to be positive. However, it is crucial to consider the entire review and evaluate all aspects of the film to form a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the reviewer's opinion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Add 33*v to both sides of the equation to get all the v terms on one side. -33*v + 33*v + 150 = -3*v + 33*v This simplifies to: 150 = 30*v Step 2: Now, we need to isolate v. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 30. 150 / 30 = 30*v / 30 This simplifies to: 5 = v So, the value of v is 5.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious. When a Jehovah Witness reject gets his own documentary on movies  or anything for that matter - it's time for anyone to get their own. Although far, far more intelligent than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult) Zizek's mouth spews just as much baloney as hers, just a different kind. He combines the worst from both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b*lls***osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories, to rant without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process misusing the English language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love. Example: there are three main Marx brothers hence what a \\"great\\" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the super-ego. I'm kind of surprised he didn't play a clip from \\"Snowhite\\" and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (Moslem hell). It's like the premise of Schumacher's \\"The Number 23\\": play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking Ancient Greeks with Princess Di's death. However, there is an entertainment element to TPGTC: watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun. Why watch \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" or any other madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching an amusing train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions. I have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie-making into an exalted intellectual social science. Giving idiotic movies like \\"Birds\\" this much thought, hence this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't require a shrink-turned-philosopher to draw one a map to understand them  unless one is a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies. Hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in Slovenia these days... When Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the \\"Psycho\\" shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in Janet Leigh's blood. Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing into it instead of out (as in menstruation), this representing some kind of \\"clever (Zizekian) irony\\". Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene (and the script), his movies wouldn't have been the illogical, far-fetched crap that they often are. The point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about \\"hidden, deep meanings\\". And when you add Zizek's fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated - i.e. the easily impressionable and the gullible. Zizek utters a number of (unintentionally) funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates Anthony Perkins's cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with \\"the satisfaction of work, of a job well done\\". Don't laugh... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of \\"Psycho\\" could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that Perkins might be enjoying a job well done - the cleaning of a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving/directing that scene. Talk about putting words into one's (dead) mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to \\"say\\". I like Zizek's initial thoughts on Tarkovsky's terrific \\"Solaris\\", but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in \\"anti-feminism\\" and other nonsense into his theory. Zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone. \\"I just want to play with it all day!\\" Logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped - at least not publicly - by the likes of him. He seems to regard logic, proof, common-sense, and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys; concepts to be either avoided, twisted to fit the end-goal, or simply annihilated. Zizek is the LSD-tripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal \\"2001\\"s. The fact that Zizek over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything - such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility. I was surprised De Palma didn't feature more prominently; that's another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible \\"Lost Highway\\". There are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it. Zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts von Trier's laughable, \\"ground-breaking\\" physical set-up in \\"Dogville\\" made me snicker.  However, Zizek doesn't only make up stuff as he goes along, he also indulges heavily in the \\"bleedin' obvious\\". Like all \\"social scientists\\" (an oxymoron), he wraps his very trite \\"observations\\" into articulate (if full of spitting) and sometimes complex blankets of language. After all, sociology functions in precisely the same way: it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it's what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: At Worcester, photography gets the blues Anna Atkins’s “Honey Locust Leaf Pod.” WORCESTER — In an age when digital dominates, it might come as a shock how many analog photographic processes there were — and are. Photographers still make daguerreotypes and platinum prints and, of course, gelatin silver prints. They still make cyanotypes, too. The format has a long and surprisingly diverse history, as “Cyanotypes: Photography’s Blue Period” demonstrates to excellent effect. The show runs through April 24 at the Worcester Art Museum. Frederick Coulson’s “Artist’s Sister in a Hat.” You likely don’t recognize the term cyanotype. But cyanotypes themselves are unmistakable, because of their predominant blueness. The best-known type of cyanotypes are architectural, the renderings known as blueprints. The astronomer Sir John Herschel invented the process, which requires only an iron-salts solution and paper. Cyanotypes can be created either as photograms, by placing an object on treated paper, or photographically, as a positive print made from contact with a negative. Either way, no darkroom is necessary. Such simplicity made the process highly popular with amateurs during its heyday, 1880-1920. While most of the 75 items in the Worcester show come from that period, the earliest dates to 1854 and the most recent from 2014. That earliest image, Anna Atkins’s study of a honey locust leaf and pod, shows how attractive the process can be. Delicacy combines with precision, thanks to the sharp contrast of botanical white revealed against Prussian blue. That blueness has a further effect, one that’s off-putting at first but on reflection quite winning. All photographs are a cheat, a two-dimensional rendering of three dimensions (four, if you count time). The chromatic oddity of cyanotypes announces their artifice from the get-go. The period charm of that blueness doubles as epistemological candor. Arthur Wesley Dow’s “Two Vases With Irises.” It can also summon up dreamscapes, as with Jesseca Ferguson’s pair of diptychs. They’re like flattened Joseph Cornell boxes. Again we find two dimensions doing the work of four, even if in this case it’s more play than work. Although there are well-known names here — Edward Steichen, Edward S. Curtis, F. Holland Day, Christian Marclay (of “The Clock” fame) — the format is the star. Curators Nancy Kathryn Burns and Kristina Wilson have put together a show that’s surprisingly, and excitingly, varied. There are still-lifes, landscapes, portraits, abstractions, assemblages, even a nude. (No, the sitter doesn’t look cold.) There are medical images that are like blueprints of the body; postcards, something of a craze around 1900, and so easy to do that senders made 90 percent of them; and even a dress, by Annie Lopez. It’s slightly above the knee, with a scoop neck — not exactly casual, but definitely ruled out as evening wear. Pride of place in “Cyanotypes” goes to Frederick K. Coulson (1869-1931), with 14 pictures. In their diversity, they reflect the show as a whole. Four potted plants have a silhouetted crispness worthy of a clinician. A man in overalls reading a book has the appeal of vintage Americana. Two portraits of Coulson’s sister — in one, sneaking a cigarette; in the other wearing the most preposterous hat this side of Terry Gilliam’s “Brazil” — bring together affection and irreverence in a way that can only be described as brotherly. An interior showing an 1898 Worcester Art Museum gallery exemplifies one of the exhibition’s nicer touches: multiple instances of cyanotypes with a local connection. As the primary color with the coolest visual temperature, blue tends toward smooth surfaces. So you might expect a consistent sameness of texture. That’s another surprise “Cyanotypes” has to offer. An Arthur Wesley Dow still life of irises suggests such tactility it could be printed on fabric. In contrast, Mike Ware’s “Ficus, October 10, 1998” has a high-gloss finish that verges on the lickable. At Worcester Art Museum, 55 Salisbury St., Worcester, through April 24, 508-799-4406, www.worcesterart.org Summary:","output":"There is a special art exhibit at the Worcester Art Museum that shows many pictures made using an old method called \\"cyanotypes.\\" These cyanotype pictures are very blue and were first invented by an astronomer named Sir John Herschel.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

Paragraph: When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back.

CHAPTER XVIII  WILDCAT AND WATER  Dave was both startled and alarmed when the wildcat came down almost on top of his bare head, and even more frightened when the beast made a leap for his naked shoulder. He had had several experiences with wildcats and knew them to be both powerful and bloodthirsty.  By instinct more than reason he dived and went down as far as possible. As soon as the water closed over the wildcat's head it let go its hold and began to swim for the shore.  Henry was directly in the path of the beast and in a second more, ere the young soldier had time to think of diving, the wildcat was on his back, sinking its cruel nails deeply into his flesh.  \\"Get off!\\" screamed Henry. \\"Get off! Help! help!\\"  And then he went down, not because he thought of doing so, but because he could not bear the weight. The stream closed over him and he went directly to the bottom.  This time the wildcat did not let go its hold. It clung desperately and when Henry tried to shake it off it only sunk its nails deeper into his flesh. Mechanically he started to scream, when the water rushed into his mouth, almost strangling him on the spot.  By this time Dave had reached the surface, and the rings and bubbles showed him plainly where Henry and the wildcat had gone down.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who Cobain hired to produce in Utero?  Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's production of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as the basis for Nevermind's songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he \\"heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody.\\" Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as \\"the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame.\\" Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa \\"blew my mind,\\" and that she \\"immediately went to track down Steve Albini.\\" Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.People connected with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: \\"I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw.\\" Gary Smith, who at the time was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he \\"was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record.\\" Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production \\"sounded way better than the other ones.\\"In 1991, as Pixies were recording Trompe le Monde, Albini described his impressions of Pixies during the recording of Surfer Rosa to the fan magazine Forced Exposure: \\"A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock.

John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force.  Hint: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.","output":"Based on the information provided, lever B would have a smaller mechanical advantage than lever A, since lever A has an ideal mechanical advantage and lever B is a real world lever that has to overcome some friction, making its actual mechanical advantage less than the ideal mechanical advantage."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically.  Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect? The answer is:","output":"Village A didn't display an observable Allee effect. Firstly, let's understand what the Allee effect is. The Allee effect refers to a phenomenon in ecology where a reduction in the population density or size of a species results in reduced birth and/or survival rates for the species. It is a density-dependent mechanism that occurs when lower population numbers or densities impact the individual and population-level performance negatively. Generally, the Allee effect is observed when the population is subjected to isolation or fragmentation, leading to lower cooperation, reproduction, and survival. Now, let's analyze the two villages Dan studied: Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years. This growth in population suggests that the individuals in this village were able to maintain an adequate birth and survival rate, which allowed them to sustain and increase the overall population size. Moreover, the increasing population size implies that the positive density-dependent factors were keeping the community viable and thriving. These factors may have included increased opportunities for mating, resource and risk sharing, and enhanced cooperative behaviors. In contrast, Village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. This situation is indicative of a population that might have experienced the Allee effect. Being isolated geographically results in limited interaction with surrounding communities, which can negatively impact resources, mating opportunities, and collaboration within the village. The decreasing population of Village B suggests that the community might have faced challenges related to reproduction and survival, which are hallmarked by the Allee effect. In summary, Village A did not display an observable Allee effect as the population grew larger over the years, indicating that the individuals were reproducing and surviving at higher rates. Meanwhile, Village B, with its declining population and geographical isolation, showed characteristics that align with the Allee effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","output":"A Sultan's wife is typically called a \\"Sultana\\" or \\"Sultanah.\\" A Sultana is the female equivalent of a Sultan and often refers to the wife or consort of a reigning Sultan. In some cases, a Sultana may hold considerable influence and authority within the court and may even wield political power. The title of Sultana has been used in several Islamic empires and kingdoms, such as the Ottoman Empire, Delhi Sultanate, and Mughal Empire. In some instances, the Sultana may act as a regent for a young, underage Sultan, or in the absence of a suitable male heir. A well-known example is the celebrated Sultana Nur Jahan of the Mughal Empire, who was the twentieth wife of Emperor Jahangir and played a significant role in state affairs during her husband's reign. While the title may confer a significant degree of authority to the holder, it is important to note that the actual power and influence of a Sultana would vary depending on the specific cultural and historical context. In some cases, a Sultana may hold a primarily ceremonial or symbolic role, whereas, in others, she could exercise considerable political leverage. In addition to the primary wife of the Sultan, the term \\"Sultana\\" can also be extended to other female members of the royal family, such as the daughters and sisters of a Sultan. These women may have held substantial property, wealth, and power within the ruling dynasty. Furthermore, in the case of female leaders who ruled in their own right, the term \\"Sultana\\" may also be applied to such women. These women were not merely the wives of Sultans but were rulers themselves, such as Razia Sultana, who ruled the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century, or Sultana Shajar al-Durr, who ruled Egypt in the 13th century as well. It is essential to recognize that the role and responsibilities of a Sultana are not fixed and may vary substantially based on the specific historical period, political climate, and cultural context. Thus, the title held different meanings and implications in different contexts. Overall, a Sultana is a significant figure in Islamic history and played various influential roles within the courts and empires they were part of, acting as wives, mothers, and, at times, leaders in their own right."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we are going to learn about a cool machine that helps keep our homes warm and cozy. This machine is called a heat pump. Just like its name, a heat pump pumps heat inside our homes to keep us comfortable. Let's talk about how to use it at its best. 1. Set Your Heat Pump to \\"Heat\\" First, we need to make sure our heat pump knows what we want it to do. So, we should set it to \\"heat\\" mode. This way, it will know that we want to warm up our home. 2. Choose the Right Temperature Next, we need to find the perfect temperature that makes our house warm but not too hot, just like Goldilocks' porridge. For our heat pump to work efficiently, we should set it at 68°F (20°C). This temperature makes the heat pump work just right without using too much energy. 3. Change the Temperature Slowly Did you know that changing the temperature too fast can confuse the heat pump? That's why we should only increase the temperature by 2 degrees at a time. This way, the heat pump won't get confused and will work better. 4. Backup Heat for Extra Cold Days Sometimes, it's just too cold outside. When the temperature drops below 35°F (2°C), our heat pump might need some help. That's when we should turn on a backup heat unit, like a space heater or a furnace. These machines can provide some extra warmth when our heat pump can't do it all by itself. In summary, kids, using a heat pump is easy and fun. All we have to do is set it to \\"heat,\\" find the perfect temperature, make small changes, and use a backup heater when it's extra cold. By doing these simple steps, we can keep our house warm and cozy all winter long. So, grab your favorite blanket, and let's enjoy our warm and comfortable home!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: THE HAGUE — For 40 years, the Dutch photographer and filmmaker Anton Corbijn has captured some of the most celebrated rock musicians and other artists of an era — Bono, Mick Jagger, Bjork, William S. Burroughs, Clint Eastwood — for magazines and books. So at first glance his conceptual series, “A. Somebody,” featuring what appear to be images of his personal musical heroes, doesn’t seem like a major departure. What is unusual, however, is that all of the portraits — including images of Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, John Lennon, and Janis Joplin — were shot in Corbijn’s remote hometown, Strijen, a village with about 9,000 residents on Hoeksche Waard, an island about an hour’s drive south of here. What’s more, these celebrities had never set foot in the village. And all of them were dead. For this series, Corbijn did something he almost never does: He turned the camera on himself, staging self-portraits in which he dressed in wigs, glasses, and clothes to evoke these famous ghosts, and mimicked not just their outward appearance but also their stage personas and facial expressions. In essence, he captured them in self-portrait as he might have photographed them if they were still alive. The series of photographs — shot in 2001-02 — is one of five sections of the exhibition “Hollands Deep,” a Corbijn retrospective at the Gemeentemuseum here and running concurrently with a survey exhibition of Corbijn’s music photography, “1-2-3-4,” at the Fotomuseum next door. “Hollands Deep” runs until June 21, while “1-2-3-4” has been extended to Aug. 16. These shows, in celebration of Corbijn’s 60th birthday last Wednesday, suggest the power of his photography in defining a generation of musical stars. At the same time, they explore his complex relationship with the creation of celebrity. “Anton Corbijn made portrait photography become an art again,” the South African artist Marlene Dumas, who is based in Amsterdam, said in an e-mail message. She collaborated with Corbijn on their 2000 book, “Strippinggirls,” with photos and paintings of dancers in striptease bars, and has admired his work since. “After years of lighthearted stuff and pretty pictures of stars all around, here comes this guy that showed photography as a dark art,” Dumas added. “Both his medium and his subjects are seen as being created out of deep shadows and accidental light.” Corbijn didn’t merely shoot images of pop musicians and other artists. He often created a band’s entire visual identity, conceiving album covers including graphic design, directing music videos, and orchestrating the look and feel of stage tours for bands like Depeche Mode and U2 since the early 1980s. Corbijn’s images of U2 from that time to about 2004 are part of “1-2-3-4,” as are images of the Rolling Stones from 1980 to 1995, and pictures of newer bands he has taken on, like Arcade Fire. “His photography was what defined the look of a generation of music,” said Kristen Lubben, curator at the International Center of Photography in New York. Lubben described his look as “disheveled glamour.” The “Hollands Deep” show includes some of Corbijn’s more recognizable images: David Bowie, in a contemplative moment backstage while performing in “The Elephant Man,” dressed in nothing but a white loincloth; Elvis Costello flat on his back on a beat-up dressing-room couch, his electric guitar lying across his chest; Miles Davis with his eyes wide open and all 10 fingers pressed into his face; Henry Rollins tinged by red paint, screaming into the camera. “Some of my most famous pictures were taken in five or 10 minutes,” Corbijn said in a recent interview, sitting on a stool in his studio in The Hague. (It functions mostly as an archive for this vast collection of negatives and prints, since he doesn’t really do studio photography.) “I just come on my own with my camera, no assistant, there’s no setting up to do, and I’m quickly done,” he added. “I don’t want to become a ‘professional photographer’ in that sense.” Corbijn said music was his passion growing up. He was raised in a religious family — his father was a Protestant parson — and the link he had to the outside world was through rock magazines and album covers. “There was a promise of a much more interesting life that came to me from the other side of the water,” he said, referring to the mainland across an estuary of the Rhine called Hollands Diep. Corbijn started carrying a camera as a way to get near the stage at concerts. His lack of technical polish was a result, he said, of being largely self-taught, and this led to the rough quality lauded by his admirers. (He said he was rejected by every art school in the Netherlands.) “He changed the idea that you shoot a rock star as a rock star,” said Benno Tempel, director of the Gemeentemuseum and the Fotomuseum. “By making a photo of the artist, he also made a photo of the music. He understood the mood of the music and he put that mood into his photographs.” After several years making his name in music magazines like New Musical Express and The Face, Corbijn was looking for a way to move beyond his commercial music work. Starting in 1989 with the book “Famouz” and following up in 1996 with “Star Trak,” he created powerful images of other people in the public eye, such as Christy Turlington crouched naked on a suspension bridge and Clint Eastwood pointing a finger directly at the camera as if to say, “Scram!” Corbijn now focuses on directing films, such as “A Most Wanted Man” (Philip Seymour Hoffman’s last film in 2014) and “The American” with George Clooney in 2010. The “1-2-3-4” show gave him an opportunity to go back through his personal photo archives. He did this mostly on his own. When he finished shooting “Life,” a film about the Magnum photographer Dennis Stock, Corbijn rented an office in Berlin to edit the footage. He worked on the film, which had its premiere in February at the Berlin International Film Festival, during the day and spent his evenings sorting through negatives. This went on for about a year. “It’s exciting when you find new photographs,” he said. “Thirty or 40 years down the line, you look at photographs very differently. You look purely at an image that has some kind of power.” Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Anton Corbijn: The Visionary Photographer Who Brought Rockstars to Life Through Portrait Art\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

In humans and many other species, circadian rhythms are controlled by a biological clock, a tiny structure located in a gland at the base of the brain. This clock sends signals to the body to regulate physiological processes and behaviors. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock, which causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Based on this information, it suggests that animals' blood pressure will generally be at its highest point during the middle of the day, or around noon, and at its lowest point during the night.

Rival Coaches Share Bond, Except on Game Days INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 5  The longtime friendship between Tony Dungy and Herman Edwards was severely tested in 1996. Edwards was a scout then with the Kansas City Chiefs, and his goal was to become a general manager, not a coach. But after Dungy became the coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he persuaded Edwards to join his staff as an assistant head coach in charge of defensive backs. Initially, Edwards said, he feared he had made a terrible career move. In the 1996 regular-season opener between Tampa Bay and Green Bay, Brett Favre threw four touchdown passes as the Packers embarrassed the Buccaneers, 34-3. “In the first half, I walked down by Tony and I asked him, ‘Why did you do this to me?’ ” Edwards recalled this week. “I had a great job in Kansas City.” Dungy laughed at the memory. “We were all worried about our careers at halftime,” Dungy said Thursday. Their careers survived, and so did their friendship. On Saturday afternoon, Dungy will coach the Indianapolis Colts against Edwards and his Chiefs in the opening round of the American Football Conference playoffs. Unlike the relationship between New England Coach Bill Belichick and Jets Coach Eric Mangini, which became frosty after Mangini left the Patriots’ staff, Edwards and Dungy say they have not let competition harm their relationship. For three decades, Dungy, 51, and Edwards 52, have been there for each other, at weddings, at funerals, on vacations and on the telephone. But for 60 minutes Saturday, they will be adversaries, an awkward situation for both. “It’s difficult in the sense that the outcome is obviously not good for one of us,” Edwards said during a conference call Wednesday. “You worked this hard to get here, then all of a sudden you have to play your best friend. That’s the difficult part. Whoever wins it, we’re going to be pulling for that guy until he gets to the Super Bowl and wins it. That’s how we’ve always felt.” Their relationship began in an odd way at the 1977 Japan Bowl, a collegiate all-star game. Dungy was a quarterback with the University of Minnesota, and Edwards was a defensive back with San Diego State. Edwards intercepted Dungy’s last pass of the game, and from that on-field encounter, a friendship clicked. Although they have similar coaching philosophies, their personalities differ. Dungy’s demeanor rarely changes during a game, whether the Colts are 20 points ahead or 20 points behind. “I’m a lot better at holding thoughts inside than I was when I was younger,” he said. “It’s something I do consciously. No. 1, I’m trying to think ahead to the next situation. No. 2, I’m trying to show my team that I’m in control and that I’m poised out there, even when I’m not.” That reserved nature did not rub off on Edwards, who can become emotional even during routine news conferences. “When we were at Tampa, guys used to say, ‘Tony won’t say it, but Herm will,’ ” Edwards said. This will be the second time that Dungy and Edwards have coached against each other in the playoffs. The first was at the end of the 2002 season, when the Jets, coached by Edwards, dominated the Colts, 41-0, at Giants Stadium. It is a day Dungy would like to forget. “We owe him one,” he said. That was the first meeting between two African-American head coaches in the N.F.L. playoffs. Seven of the league’s 32 teams were coached by African-Americans this season, although two lost their jobs this week: Dennis Green in Arizona and Art Shell in Oakland. No African-American head coach has reached the Super Bowl, but Dungy and Edwards hope to change that this season. Edwards spent five years as Dungy’s assistant in Tampa Bay, before becoming the Jets’ coach in 2001. He spent five seasons in that job before leaving after last season to coach the Chiefs. He says he feels for Dungy, who is making his eighth consecutive playoff appearance but who has yet to reach the league’s ultimate game. Each season, the pressure increases. “There are a lot of great players, a lot of great coaches, that maybe never coach in a Super Bowl game,” Edwards said. He mentioned the time it took Bill Cowher to win one with the Steelers and how long Marty Schottenheimer of the San Diego Chargers has been trying. Edwards and Dungy spoke by telephone Monday, but they said they would not talk to each other again until before the game, on the field. Dungy said he would have preferred a different first-round opponent to avoid facing his friend. “They’re not fun games,” Dungy said. “It’s just different. It’s really hard to explain, but it goes with the territory.” During the season, Edwards and Dungy most often talk during losing streaks or difficult times. When Dungy’s 18-year-old son, James, committed suicide in December 2005, Edwards was still coaching the Jets, who played the night before James’s funeral. The Jets lost that game to New England, 31-21, and Edwards did not leave Giants Stadium until after 1 a.m. But the next day, he was at the funeral in Florida. “After the game, me and my wife looked at each other and said, ‘We’re going,’ ” Edwards said. “We got on the plane that morning. We didn’t sleep at all. We had to be there. I would’ve walked there. That’s what friends are for. You’ve got to support them when times are tough.” Saturday night will be tough for whichever coach loses, particularly if it is Dungy, given the Colts’ 12-4 record and their previous playoff disappointments. But for both men, the friendship will continue. “I feel like he’s my brother,” Edwards said. “He helped me a lot with my life when I went down to Tampa, just being a better man, and a person. That’s kind of where it stands with me and him.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are about the strong friendship between Tony Dungy and Herman Edwards, who are both football coaches. They have known each other for a long time and supported each other through both good and bad times. However, when their teams play against each other, like in the upcoming football game, they have to compete against each other and put their friendship aside for a while. Their friendship started back in 1977, and they have different personalities and coaching styles. They both hope to make history by becoming the first African-American head coaches to reach the Super Bowl."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Explanation: When you use an electronic device for extended periods, the device consumes power from the batteries to perform various tasks. This power consumption generates heat in the process, primarily due to the resistance encountered by electrons as they flow within the device's circuits and components. As a result, the batteries heat up, making them hot to the touch.  This phenomenon occurs due to the conversion of electrical energy within the battery into other forms of energy, such as thermal energy (heat) and kinetic energy (motion). In the case of a hot battery, the conversion of electrical energy to heat is what causes the battery to become warm or hot.  Multiple factors could contribute to the increase in temperature, such as the battery's chemistry, internal resistance, discharge rate, and the efficiency of the energy conversion within the electronic device. Furthermore, devices that demand higher power output or have poor heat dissipation mechanisms will contribute to a more significant temperature increase. When a battery heats up, it becomes a source of heat itself. In principle, a source of heat can be defined as any substance or object that raises the temperature of its surroundings due to its energy transfer. This energy transfer commonly takes place in the form of conduction, convection, or radiation. In the case of a hot battery in an electronic device, the energy transfer primarily occurs through conduction, as the heat generated within the device's components gets transferred to the surrounding materials. Additionally, it may also cause the surrounding air to heat up, causing convective currents that further contribute to heat distribution. Therefore, a hot battery in an electronic device can be considered a source of heat as long as it continues to produce thermal energy through prolonged use or inefficient energy conversion processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Make an appointment with your general practitioner or an endocrinologist. They will likely run a series of blood tests to determine if you are GH deficient. Sometimes low GH levels can be connected with other conditions as well, such as Turner Syndrome. Your doctor can also discuss possible safe treatment and care options with you.  Your doctor may take multiple blood samples to test for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels.  Keep in mind that it is normal for your GH levels to lower as you age. GH injections are available by prescription if you are diagnosed by a doctor. They are given via a pen-like device and are relatively pain free. The injections are usually given around bedtime and are usually successful at boosting the production of GH overnight. Injections may be combined with oral supplements as part of a larger GH therapy program. Be aware that GH injections provided outside of a doctor’s prescription are illegal and highly dangerous. You can also take supplements as part of a broader hormonal therapy program. You will want to discuss this with your doctor and they can either write you a prescription or direct you toward certain brands. Some amino acid supplements, such as arginine, come in an oral form. You may need to take a higher dose in order to see results, so make sure to consult with a doctor for safety.  For example, a sample dosage of arginine could be between five to nine grams after each work-out session.  Before you start supplements, your doctor should do a complete blood count. As you take the supplements, visit your doctor to monitor your liver enzymes, just in case there is a problem. There is no one pill that is an immediate HGH cure-all. The same goes for any creams advertised as an instant GH boost. Creams are considered only minimally effective at boosting GH. When in doubt, talk with your doctor about any treatments and verify that they are medically sound before proceeding.","output":"The article discusses the process of diagnosing GH (growth hormone) deficiency, including consulting with a general practitioner or endocrinologist, undergoing blood tests, and exploring safe treatment options such as GH injections, oral supplements, and hormonal therapy, while emphasizing the importance of doctor's guidance and monitoring for safety and effectiveness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai.  The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

I hate her,” Seinfeld joked during an interview on WFAN radio Monday night. “I can’t believe they put her in my box, which I paid for.”      Seinfeld was referring to June 10 incident at Citi Field when the eccentric singer stripped down to her bra and bikini bottom and boorishly barraged fans and photographers with double-barrel bird-flipping during a bizarre, profanity-laced meltdown.      Gaga showed up during the fifth inning of the day game between the Mets and Padres and was furious that her front-row seats were so close to photographers covering the game. Instead of sitting, she vanished into a lower-deck concourse — only to reappear in the seventh inning in the empty luxury box owned by Seinfeld, a big Mets fan.      “You give people the finger and you get upgraded? Is that the world we’re living in now? he said.      In his trademark stand-up schtick, Seinfeld added, “Why is she giving the finger? How old is the finger? How’d it even get to be the finger?”      By the time fans and photographers spotted her, she had shed her coat to reveal bedazzled undies that looked like the get-up she wore in the video for her single “Telephone.”      When host Steve Somers brought up the episode, Seinfeld at first said, “I wish her the best,” but then added, “you take one ‘A’ off of that and you’ve got gag.”      “I don’t know what these young people think or how they promote their careers,” he said. “I’m older, I’m 56. I look at Lady Gaga the way Keith Hernandez watches these kids when they pull the pocket out, they wear the inside-out pocket. … Do you think he understands that? He can’t understand that. That’s a new game, that’s kids.”      He added, “I’m not one of these all-publicity-is-good people. People talk about you need exposure — you could die of exposure.”      “She is talented,” admitted Seinfeld. “I don’t know why she’s doing this stuff.”      Seinfeld said he didn’t know she’d been taken to his box until he arrived for the night game of the doubleheader.      Then when Somers pointed out that Gaga was at the Yankee game Friday, Seinfeld said, “Oh please, wake me when it’s over.”      “You’ve had enough of her?” Somers asked.      “Yeah,” Seinfeld said. ||||| Craig Carton      Thursday, July 8th - Craig Carton who happends to be in Miami on vacation checks in with Steve to set the scene from South Beach as we all await LeBron's decision.

A British rugby player has been killed following a hit and run accident, Italian police have confirmed. Brendan Lynch, 26, who played for Gloucester and Rotherham Titans suffered fatal injuries after he was knocked form his Honda SH300 scooter in the early hours of the morning. Mr Lynch had moved to Rome recently and played for Capitolina, the city's main rugby club and he also worked for the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation which is based in the Italian capital. Fatal injuries: Talented rugby player Brendan Lynch, 26, pictured centre with the ball, was knocked from his scooter by a vehicle which then fled the scene, police said. He was considered to be one of the best tighthead props in Italian rugby and was a regular first team player for Capitolina - whose facilities have been used by England for practice ahead of the Six Nations match against Italy. Police said that Mr Lynch's scooter was hit by another car as he travelled on the Rome ring road near Settebagni just to the north of the capital and the vehicle had then sped off leaving him fatally injured by the side of the road. Passing motorists alerted emergency services but he was declared dead at the scene. Traffic police spokesman Roberto Ferilli said: 'We are investigating the circumstances of the accident and are appealing for any witnesses to contact us. 'We are also using cctv footage from the motorway to identify the vehicle. It appears the scooter he was travelling on was hit by another vehicle which failed to stop.' On its website Capitolina paid tribute to Mr Lynch adding that as a mark of respect it was cancelling all training sessions and club activities for 24 hours. Despite being born in Rotherham and having British citizenship Mr Lynch had also played for Ireland's Under 19 thanks to his Irish ancestors. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Rome said: 'I can confirm the death of a British national in a road traffic accident - other than that there is nothing else we can say.' A friend of Mr Lynch's, who asked not to be named, paid tribute to him and said: 'He was a really nice guy, really friendly and always had a smile. 'He enjoyed playing rugby and was a popular member of the club. He will be sadly missed.'

Mothers who feel their children don' t appreciate them can add another _ to the list: half the time, their children are lying to them. A study designed to expose the truth about lying shows that undergraduates lie to their mothers in 46% of their conversations. Still, mums should feel better than total strangers, who are told lies an astonishing 77 % of the time. Bella Depaulo and a team of psychologists from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, asked 77 undergraduates to keep a record of all their conversations for a week, and write down whether they lied at any time. DePaulo named lying broadly, as \\"when you intentionally try to mislead someone\\", so she would catch the smallest of lies. The students told an average of two lies a day. They said they had been studying when they had been out drinking. One told his parents that a textbook cost 50 rather than 20 so that they would send him extra money. Female students constantly told their plain-looking roommates that they were pretty. \\"They are everyday lies,\\" says DePaulo. DePaulo and her colleagues conclude that people tend to tell fewer lies to those they feel closest to. College students lied to their best friends 28% of the time but lied to acquaintances 48% of the time. In close relationships, people were more likely to tell \\"kind-hearted\\" lies, designed to protect feelings, rather than self-serving lies. Romantic partners lie somewhere between close friends and acquaintances. Students lied to romantic partners about a third of the time. DePaulo thinks that unmarried lovers can expect less honesty than best friends because of the insecurity that comes with romance. Mothers can take heart from one other finding. They may have been lied to, but at least their children talked to them. The students were recorded telling few lies to their fathers because they had little interaction with them.

The study was designed to reveal the frequency of lying in various social relationships. The students were asked to keep a record of all their conversations for a week and write down if they lied at any point. DePaulo defined lying broadly, as \\"when you intentionally try to mislead someone\\", in order to include even the smallest of lies.  The findings of the study show that the students told an average of two lies per day. Some common examples of lies included claiming to have been studying when they were actually out drinking, inflating the cost of textbooks to receive more money from their parents, and complimenting plain-looking roommates to boost their self-esteem. DePaulo and her colleagues concluded that people tend to lie less often to those they feel closest to. College students were found to lie to their best friends 28% of the time, while lying to acquaintances 48% of the time. In close relationships, people are more likely to tell kind-hearted lies, which are designed to protect feelings rather than serve their own interests. Interestingly, romantic partners fall somewhere between close friends and acquaintances in terms of lying frequency, with students lying to romantic partners about a third of the time. DePaulo believes that unmarried lovers can expect less honesty than best friends due to the insecurity associated with romantic relationships. One positive aspect for mothers, as noted in the study, was that even though they were lied to, their children still engaged in more conversations with them than with their fathers, who were told fewer lies simply because there was less interaction between the students and their fathers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Resident Evil: Afterlife Movie plot: In this fourth Resident Evil movie, opening a few weeks the events of 'Resident Evil: Extinction', the Alice clones (Milla Jovovich) attempt to kill Umbrella CEO Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) at his base in Japan. All present clones are killed when the facility is destroyed in an explosion, activated by Wesker as he escapes in an aircraft. The original Alice ambushes him, but Wesker injects her with a serum that neutralizes the T-virus in her system, eliminating her superhuman powers and making her human again. He reveals that his T-Virus powers have surpassed her own, but before he can kill her, the aircraft crashes and Alice emerges from the wreckage.Six months later. Alice follows a repeating emergency broadcast from a survivors' safe haven known as \\"Arcadia\\" in Alaska. After many fruitless months searching for Arcadia and finding no survivors along the way, including her friends from the previous movie, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) and K-Mart (Spencer Locke), Alice begins to lose hope, believing herself to be the last surviving human on the planet. Stopping on an abandoned beach, Alice finds the helicopter taken by Claire and the others when they and Alice parted ways. A crazed Claire, under the influence of an Umbrella Corporation device attached to her chest, attacks her. Alice removes the device, finding that it has damaged Claire's memory, which she slowly regains.Flying a two-person plane, they enter the ruins of Los Angeles and find a small group of survivors, led by Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) living in a maximum security prison, surrounded by the undead. Alice crash lands the plane on the roof of the prison and learn that Arcadia is not a fixed place but actually a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. Since the plane cannot take more than two, Alice and the survivors try to figure out a means to make it to Arcadia together.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Predation A predator's effect on its prey species is hard to see in the short-term. However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources. If a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction. This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators. This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator. One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible). An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species, giving the population a chance to recover, however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction. Q: The rise and fall of predator and prey populations are similar to what, in the US economy?","output":"The rise and fall of predator and prey populations are similar to the boom-and-bust cycle in the US economy. Like the ebb and flow of predator and prey populations, the economy too experiences periods of economic expansion (or \\"boom\\"), followed by periods of economic contraction (or \\"bust\\").  In periods of economic boom, there is increased production and consumption, businesses thrive, employment rates are high, and the general mood of consumers is optimistic. However, this period of prosperity cannot sustain indefinitely. Variabilities such as inflation, market saturation, or external economic shocks can lead to an economic contraction or a \\"bust\\". During a bust, there's a decrease in production and consumption, businesses struggle or go bankrupt, unemployment rises, and consumers' mood turns pessimistic. Relating this to predator and prey dynamics, the \\"boom\\" period can be equated to when the population of the prey increases. This abundance of prey leads to an increase in the population of predators because of the availability of food (resources). However, over time, as the predator population increases, the prey population decreases due to overpredation -- similar to a \\"bust\\" in the economy. As the prey population shrinks, so does the predator population due to reduced food sources. This results in a period of scarcity until the cycle begins anew with the slow recovery of the prey population, followed by the predator population, mirroring the recession and recovery stages of the economic cycle.  However, it is noteworthy to mention that while economic forces can be regulated, monitored, and to an extent manipulated to prevent or alleviate a bust, the dynamics of predator-prey populations function within the principles of natural ecology and lack human directive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities.

The answer is:","output":"Jolene's grandmother, who just turned 66 years old, is more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than her granddaughter. The provided paragraph states that breast cancer is rare in teens, implying that Jolene is a teenager and therefore at a lower risk for breast cancer. Furthermore, the paragraph mentions that breast cancer becomes more common as females get older. Consequently, the grandmother's age of 66 years places her in a higher risk category than her young granddaughter. Age is an essential factor in breast cancer risk. As women age, their chances of developing breast cancer increase. The paragraph reinforces this idea by stating that breast cancer is rare in teens and becomes more common with age. The American Cancer Society supports this notion, indicating that breast cancer risk significantly increases after the age of 50. Other factors contribute to breast cancer risk, such as genetics, family history, hormonal factors, and lifestyle choices. However, age remains one of the most influential factors in determining breast cancer risk. While it is not guaranteed that Jolene's grandmother will be diagnosed with breast cancer, her age of 66 places her at a higher risk than her teenage granddaughter.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: President Barack Obama once believed marriage was only between a man and a woman. He then backed civil unions for gay and lesbian couples, granting them many of the same rights and privileges as married heterosexuals. Now he firmly supports a constitutional right that has put him at odds with many social conservatives. It is a personal and political evolution that in many ways reflects the country as a whole. Shifting public opinion and old fights over judicial power are at the nexus of perhaps the most important social issue the high court has addressed in recent years: same-sex marriage. There about 120,000 legally married homosexual couples in the United States. Many thousands more seek the same thing. But it may be 10 people who have the power to force immediate, real change on this legal, political, and social issue: the nine justices and Obama himself. How U.S. political leaders and the Supreme Court act in coming months could set the template for years on a contentious topic that shows no sign of cooling. \\"The argument that the Obama administration has made is the Supreme Court should look at these laws very carefully because gays and lesbians are a group that have been subject to discrimination in the past and will be subject to discrimination going forward,\\" said Amy Howe, a legal analyst and editor of SCOTUSblog.com. Kevin has a family: A same-sex couple's remarkable journey. \\"So the Supreme Court would need to subject these laws to what we call a very stringent standard of review\\" balancing the government's justification for enacting them, she added. Two separate appeals to be argued Tuesday and Wednesday will once again put the high court at center stage, a contentious encore to its summer ruling upholding the health care reform law championed by Obama. Nine states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage, including Washington, Maryland, Maine, Iowa, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York. Another nine have civil union or strong domestic partnership laws. The high court will consider two appeals. The first involves the federal Defense of Marriage Act. DOMA is a 1996 law that defines marriage between one man and one woman. That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, family medical leave protections, and other provisions do not apply to gay and lesbian couples. Edie Windsor, an 84-year-old New York woman, is the key plaintiff. She was forced to pay more than 363,000 in extra estate taxes when her longtime spouse, Thea Spyer, died. The second case involves California's Proposition 8, a 2008 referendum that abolished same-sex marriage after the state's highest court ruled it legal. Gay couple fights for right to marry in epic high court battle. The Supreme Court is being asked to establish same-sex marriage as a constitutional right, but could also decide a more narrower question: Whether a state can revoke that right through referendum once it has already been recognized. Running for the Illinois state senate in 1998, Obama said he was \\"undecided\\" about whether to legalize same-sex marriage. Fast-forward six years to when he ran for U.S. Senate. He then declared a belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. The stance began an internal process over time that was by his admission, anything but smooth. \\"My feelings about this are constantly evolving. I struggle with this,\\" he said in 2010, two years into his presidency. \\"At this point, what I've said is that my baseline is a strong civil union that provides them the protections and the legal rights that married couples have,\\" Obama said at the time. Eight such states have civil union or strong domestic partnership laws-- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, and Rhode Island. But it is the California case that really has drawn the Obama administration into the fight. Obama signaled earlier this month he was prepared to assert a vigorous constitutional right to marriage, but confine it for now only to the Proposition 8 matter and perhaps to the seven other states with civil union laws like California's. The Justice Department argues civil union and domestic partnership laws may themselves be unconstitutional and that those states should go all the way and grant same-sex couples full marriage rights. It's called the eight-state strategy. \\"The object of California's establishment of the legal relationship of domestic partnership is to grant committed same-sex couples rights equivalent to those accorded a married couple. But Proposition 8, by depriving same-sex couples of the right to marry, denies them the dignity, respect, and stature accorded similarly situated opposite-sex couples under state law,\\" the Justice Department said in its brief on the case. Gay rights groups had privately urged Obama and his top aides to go beyond his previous personal rhetoric in support of the right, and come down \\"on the side of history\\" in this legal struggle. This was all set in motion in the heat of the president's re-election campaign in what government sources described as a quickly arranged political strategy. Married same-sex couple awaits epic appeal. \\"At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,\\" Obama told ABC News. Perhaps bowing to political caution in an election year, Obama explained he \\"hesitated on gay marriage\\" partly because he thought civil unions \\"would be sufficient.\\" \\"I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, the word marriage was something that invokes very powerful traditions and religious beliefs,\\" he said. A new national survey indicates a small majority of Americans backs such marriages but there are generational and partisan divides as well as a gender gap. According to a CNN/ORC International poll, 53 percent of the public think marriages between gay or lesbian couples should be legally recognized as valid, with 44 percent opposed. \\"There are big differences among younger and older Americans, with the youngest age group twice as likely than senior citizens to support same-sex marriage,\\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \\"Women are also more likely to call for legal recognition of gay marriage than men. And only three in ten Americans who attend religious services every week support same-sex marriage while six in ten Americans who don't attend church weekly feel that way.\\" Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the marriage law into effect 17 years ago, said this month he now backs the right of homosexuals to marry. So, too, does his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2016. But others on the right say society benefits from preserving a view of marriage that has been in place for centuries. The authors of a new book, \\"What is Marriage? Man and Woman: A Defense,\\" say, \\"Redefining marriage would, by further eroding its central norms, weaken an institution that has already been battered by widespread divorce, out-of-wedlock child bearing and the like.\\" Academics Robert George, Sherif Girgis, and Ryan Anderson say marriage should be more than \\"commitment based on emotional companionship,\\" and has been practiced for a specific reason throughout this country's history. \\"All human beings are equal in dignity and should be equal before the law. But equality only forbids arbitrary distinctions,\\" they argue. \\"And there is nothing arbitrary about maximizing the chances that children will know the love of their biological parents in a committed and exclusive bond. A strong marriage culture serves children, families and society by encouraging the ideal of giving kids both a mom and a dad.\\" Line forms days ahead of Supreme Court same-sex argument. The DOMA and Prop 8 cases will test the delicate line over constitutional limits from both congressional, presidential, and judicial power. All nine justices will have an equal voice in both oral argument and an eventual ruling, but it may be one member of the court whose views may count most in the high-stakes quest for five votes. Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the landmark 1996 Romer v. Evans ruling, striking down a Colorado constitutional amendment that forbid local communities from passing laws banning discrimination against gays. The moderate-conservative wrote for the 6-3 majority, rejecting the state's argument the law only blocked gay people from receiving preferential treatment or \\"special rights.\\" In dissent Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the court for placing what he said was \\"the prestige of this institution behind the proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial or religious bias.\\" In 2003, Kennedy authored the court's decision overturning state laws criminalizing homosexual sodomy. At the time though, he cautioned the court was not endorsing the idea of same-sex marriage, saying the private conduct case at hand \\"does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.\\" That caution was further articulated this month by Kennedy, when he said some issues are best left to the other branches. \\"I think it's a serious problem. A democracy should not be dependent for its major decisions on what nine unelected people from a narrow legal background have to say,\\" Kennedy said. By patiently letting legislatures and the voters decide the social and practical implications of same-sex marriage over the past decade, the high court is now poised to perhaps offer the final word on tricky constitutional questions. Or not. The split 5-4 conservative-liberal bench has the option of ruling broadly or narrowly-- perhaps taking a series of incremental cases over a period years, building political momentum and public confidence in the process. The Prop 8 case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (12-144). The DOMA case is U.S. v. Windsor (12-307). Opinion: Slowly, GOP shifting on same-sex marriage.

Write a title for this article: PHOENIX – A woman charged in the savage stabbing and shooting death of her lover told jurors Monday how she endured an abusive childhood at the hands of her parents and planned to commit suicide after she killed her on-again, off-again boyfriend. Jodi Arias' testimony was a surprise move by defense attorneys in a sensational murder trial in Phoenix that has become a daily fixture on cable news with its lurid stories of sex, lies, religion, betrayal and violence. Arias, 32, could become just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row if convicted. Arias' testimony aimed to portray her as a childhood abuse victim and naive teenager who stayed with boyfriends even after they cheated on her and became violent at times. Defense attorneys claim it was a similar scenario throughout her relationship with Travis Alexander, a successful businessman and motivational speaker, who Arias killed in June 2008, she says, in self-defense. She is charged with killing the 30-year-old man in what prosecutors describe as a fit of jealous rage after she found out he'd planned to take a trip to Mexico with another woman. Authorities say she stabbed and slashed him 27 times, slit his throat from ear to ear and shot him in the forehead, leaving his bloody body in the bathroom of his suburban Phoenix home to be found five days later by friends. Arias claims it was self-defense as Alexander attacked her after inviting her to his home for sex on the day of the killing. Her trial began in early January with a series of salacious details about a torrid romance between Arias and Alexander after they met at a Las Vegas conference in late 2006. She claims they dated for about five months, then broke up but continued to see each other for sex up until the day of his death. She initially told police she knew nothing of the killing, then later blamed it on masked intruders. She finally admitted her involvement, but claimed self-defense -- kill or be killed by the enraged man. She testified Monday that she lied early in the investigation about not being at the scene of the crime because she planned to commit suicide so there would never be a trial. \\"At the time, I had plans to commit suicide. So I was extremely confident that no jury would convict me because I didn't expect any of you to be here,\\" Arias told jurors. \\"I planned to be dead.\\" In a soft-spoken voice, Arias calmly described how an idyllic childhood in California turned abusive when she was about 7 years old. She said her parents beat her with belts and wooden spoons, and the abuse later escalated into shoving her into furniture and slapping her in the face for misdeeds such as sneaking out of the house. Her mother sat in the front row of the courtroom and showed no emotion as Arias described her childhood. Arias then went on to recount other stories from her youth that sometimes turned bizarre. She described meeting a high school boyfriend at a carnival when she was 15 and he was 18. Arias said the two dated for a while, but she broke it off because \\"he had all kinds of wild ideas.\\" \\"He entertained the belief in vampires,\\" she said, adding that he wanted the pair to move to San Francisco to hunt them. She said a few months after she broke up with the boy, she learned he was so distraught over the relationship's demise that he had slit both his wrists and tried to kill himself. Arias said she reconnected with him about \\"19 months\\" later after a man she met in her father's restaurant had told her that the \\"second coming\\" of Jesus Christ would occur in late 1997. \\"I was really naive and I kind of believed him,\\" Arias testified. She wanted to warn her former boyfriend, she said. But she said it wasn't long until the relationship turned stormy. She discovered he had been exchanging romantic emails with another woman, but she continued to date him. Later, she said he tried to strangle her and told her \\"how he would kill each member of my family.\\" Throughout the trial, defense attorneys have tried to depict Alexander as a liar and cheat who told Arias and other girlfriends he was a devout Mormon saving sex for marriage, while in reality he was having sex with multiple women, cheating on some with others. Prosecutors have portrayed Arias as a jealous ex-girlfriend who couldn't let go of Alexander and stalked him for months after their breakup until finally snapping and killing him. Authorities say they found her hair and bloody palm print at the scene of the killing, along with time-stamped photographs on a camera discovered inside Alexander's washing machine that place Arias there on the day he died. The photos included one of Arias nude on his bed, one of Alexander alive in the shower, then one of his body on the bathroom floor. Defense attorneys have yet to explain why Arias apparently attempted to clean the scene and what happened to the weapons. Authorities say Alexander was shot in the head with a .25 caliber gun, the same caliber Arias' grandparents reported stolen from their Northern California home about a week before the killing.

For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). Originally formed as a four-piece hardcore punk band, the Young Aborigines, in 1978 by Diamond (vocals), John Berry (guitar), Yauch (bass) and Kate Schellenbach (drums), the band appeared on the compilation cassette New York Thrash, contributing two songs from their first EP, Polly Wog Stew, in 1982. Berry left shortly thereafter, and was replaced by Horovitz. On May 4, 2012, Yauch died from cancer at the age of 47. On May 24, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Mike D said that the Beastie Boys recorded new music in late 2011 after the release of Hot Sauce Committee (Part 2), but he did not say if these recordings would be released. He also said that the Beastie Boys would likely disband due to the death of MCA, though he was open to making new music with Ad-Rock and that \\"Yauch would genuinely want us to try whatever crazy thing we wanted but never got around to.\\"  In April 2013 it was announced that the group has signed a deal to write an autobiography. The book was scheduled to be released in the fall of 2015. However, Horovitz stated that the autobiography is being delayed. According to Horovitz, \\"We've got pages!....How it's going to fit together, I don't know. But we've got some ideas. It's interesting. It's fun.\\"  On May 3, 2013 a children's playground in Brooklyn was renamed for Adam Yauch. In June 2014, Mike D stated that neither he nor Horovitz would perform under the Beastie Boys name again out of respect for Yauch.  Founding Beastie Boys guitarist John Berry died on May 19, 2016, aged 52, as a result of frontotemporal dementia, after a decline of health for several years. He was credited with coming up with the Beastie Boys name, and played guitar on the first EP the Beastie Boys recorded. Before the Beastie Boys, he was also a part of Even Worse, Big Fat Love, Highway Stars, Bourbon Deluxe, and Idaho. The first Beastie Boys show took place at Berry's loft.

A coalition of groups is asking for a commitment to make all homes energy category C standard by 2025. About 1,482,000 homes in Scotland are rated below C, which is the minimum level of warmth needed to reduce the risk of death and ill health. More than 50 major civil society and business organisations have signed a joint-statement calling for the next Scottish government to make a commitment that \\"No one in Scotland is living in a hard-to-heat, draughty home, by 2025.\\" Alan Ferguson, chairman of the Existing Homes Alliance said: \\"These figures show that if the next Scottish Government set an objective to bring all homes in Scotland to at least a 'C' energy performance standard by 2025, they could end the scourge of cold homes currently affecting thousands of households across Scotland.\\" The figures were compiled using recent data from the register of Energy Performance Certificates, known as EPCs. The coldest homes are in Highlands and Islands, where 76% of people live in a property that falls below category C for energy performance. Dr Sam Gardner, head of policy at WWF Scotland, said: \\"Heating Scotland's buildings accounts for over half of our climate change emissions. \\"Ensuring every home reaches a C Energy performance standard by 2025 is the minimum level of ambition required to allow our climate change targets to be met. \\"A political commitment that no-one should live in a hard-to-heat, draughty home would be good for millions of households, and would drastically reduce emissions too.\\" The figures also show that the households in the lowest energy efficiency bands are also more likely to be living in fuel poverty.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The protected cruiser is a type of naval cruiser of the late 19th century, so known because its armoured deck offered protection for vital machine spaces from fragments caused by exploding shells above. Protected cruisers were an alternative to the armoured cruisers, which also had a belt of armour along the sides.  - A warship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare. Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state. As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships. Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew. Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations.  - A battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a capital ship built in the first half of the 20th century. They were similar in size, cost, and armament to battleships, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.  - The capital ships of a navy are its most important warships; they are generally the larger ships when compared to other warships in their respective fleet. A capital ship is generally a leading or a primary ship in a naval fleet.  - Pre-dreadnought battleships were sea-going battleships built between the mid- to late 1880s and 1905, before the launch of . Pre-dreadnoughts replaced the ironclad battleships of the 1870s and 1880s. Built from steel, and protected by hardened steel armour, pre-dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in barbettes (open or with armored gunhouses) supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons. They were powered by coal-fuelled triple-expansion steam engines.  - The armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered. Varying in size, it was distinguished from other types of cruiser by its belt armorthick iron (or later steel) plating on much of the hull to protect the ship from shellfire much like that on battleships. The first armored cruiser, the Imperial Russian Navy's , was launched in 1873 and combined sail and steam propulsion. By the 1890s cruisers had abandoned sail and took on a modern appearance.  - A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of large caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was vital for any nation that desired to maintain command of the sea.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - A cruiser is a type of warship. The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the Age of Sail, the term \\"cruising\\" referred to certain kinds of missions  independent scouting, commerce protection, or raiding  fulfilled by a frigate or sloop, which were the \\"cruising warships\\" of a fleet.  - The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's , made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as \\"dreadnoughts\\", and earlier battleships became known as \\"pre-dreadnoughts\\". \\"Dreadnought\\"s design had two revolutionary features: an \\"all-big-gun\\" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships was a crucial catalyst in the intensifying naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. With the launch of a single ship, \\"Dreadnought\\", the scales of naval power were reset overnight. As a result, dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, during the lead up to World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships had outclassed \\"Dreadnought\\". These more powerful vessels were known as \\"super-dreadnoughts.\\" Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued to be used throughout World War II. The only surviving dreadnought is , located near the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site.  - The Grand Fleet was the main fleet of the British Royal Navy during the First World War.  - HMS Defence was a Minotaur - class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century , the last armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy . She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau . The ship was transferred to the Grand Fleet in January 1915 and remained there for the rest of her career . Defence was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the Battle of Jutland , the largest naval battle of the war . Escorting the main body of the Grand Fleet , the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four dreadnoughts as she attempted to engage a disabled German light cruiser . She was struck by two salvoes from the German ships that detonated her rear magazine . The fire from that explosion spread to the ship 's secondary magazines , which exploded in turn . There were no survivors .  - A light cruiser is a type of small- or medium-sized warship. The term is a shortening of the phrase \\"light armored cruiser\\", describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser: a protective belt and deck. Prior to this smaller cruisers had been of the protected cruiser model, possessing armored decks only.    What is the relationship between 'hms defence ' and 'armored cruiser'? Answer:","output":"HMS Defence was a Minotaur-class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. It was the last armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy. The relationship between HMS Defence and 'armored cruiser' is that HMS Defence was a type of armored cruiser used by the Royal Navy during that time period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Vanessa-Mae was banned from international skiing for four years yesterday after taking part in fixed races to help her qualify for the Winter Olympics. The 36-year-old British violinist competed for Thailand, the country of her father’s birth, at the Games in Sochi last February. She skied under the name Vanessa Vanakorn and said it had been an ‘amazing’ experience despite coming last out of 67 competitors. Scroll down for video. Banned: Violinist Vanessa-Mae, pictured on Monday ahead of a concert in Prague, took part in fixed races in Slovenia in order to qualify for the Sochi Winter Olympic, organised at the request of her manager. But yesterday the Swiss-based International Ski Federation (FIS) said it had found ‘violations’ in her results from a hastily staged event in Slovenia held days before the deadline for Olympic qualification. It said that without the cheating she would not have achieved the points needed to be eligible to ski in the Games. Officials are said to have invented times for skiers who did not race and faked times for skiers who did not finish. They also broke rules by not changing the course design between the first and second runs, and allowing skiers to continue in poor weather which required abandonment. Five officials involved in the event at Krvavec in Slovenia have been banned by FIS. It is unclear if Thai Olympic officials were involved or if they will face IOC sanctions. The FIS said: ‘The competitions were organised at the request of the management of Vanessa Vanakorn, through the Thai Olympic Committee.’ FIS president Gian Franco Kasper said: ‘Those who have been sanctioned have been sanctioned for good reason.’ Cheater, cheater: Vanessa-Mae, who competed for Thailand as Vanessa Vanakorn, finished last of 67 racers in the two-run giant slalom in Sochi, almost a minute slower than the winner. Fake it til you make it: The International Ski Federation ruled that Vanessa-Mae would not have been able to qualify for the Olympic Games without the cheating. The International Olympic Committee declined to comment on details of the case until possible appeals are completed. Last night Vanessa-Mae was unavailable for comment. But if she does harbour dreams of another Olympic appearance, she may be disappointed. It is thought the ban would prevent her from competing at the next Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018. The classical music star was born in Singapore to Thai and Chinese parents and moved to England at the age of four. Shortly after finishing the Games in February, she said: ‘With my limited experience – I only started training six months ago – I’m just glad I made it down.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Items are collected - The items are sorted - Trash is removed from everything else - Goes to a landfill - The items go into a baler machine for each kind of material - They come out as bales - The bales are shipped to manufacturers to use to make products.  Question: suppose Less sunlight is available to the plants happens, how will it affect fewer items are sorted.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The question connects two different processes: photosynthesis (where sunlight is needed by plants) and waste sorting (which is related to waste management and recycling processes). Let's analyze these two processes independently at first.  The process with the plants is photosynthesis, where plants convert light energy, usually from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities. This process requires sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Therefore, a reduction in sunlight would mean a decrease in photosynthesis activity, which could result in less plant growth and, indirectly, less biomass production. On the other hand, the process of sorting items is an integral part of waste management. This procedure involves collecting items, sorting them out, removing trash, sending them to a landfill, or recycling them. The output of this process is ultimately affected by human consumption and production behaviors - the quantity and type of waste people produce. Working to connect these two processes, the relationship isn't direct. In a general sense, if there was less plant growth or fewer plants due to lowered photosynthesis, there could arguably be fewer plant-based items (like paper or cardboard) to recycle. However, this is relatively indirect and takes a long time to manifest. The majority of the items sorted in the waste management process are not solely plant-based or influenced by the plant growth rate or photosynthesis. Instead, they are derived from other materials like plastic, metals, glass, etc., or are post-consumer waste from humans. So, even if \\"Less sunlight is available to the plants,\\" it might have a very minimal or negligible effect on the amount of \\"fewer items are sorted.\\" The sorting process depends largely on human consumption and waste disposal habits, and less on the rate of plant production or photosynthesis.  Thus, the supposed perturbation – that is, the reduced availability of sunlight to plants – would have very \\"little to no effect\\" on the sorting process, especially within a short timeframe. It would take a significant decrease in plant-based items over a long period to see any substantive impact on the sorting process. For this reason, it is also essential to consider the time scale in such considerations. Short-term effects would likely be negligible, but long-term effects could gradually become more significant, although still relatively small. So, under most circumstances, we could confidently argue the effect would remain minor. In conclusion, a lesser availability of sunlight to plants likely has little to no effect on the sorting phase of waste management, as plant-derived items form a small part of waste materials, and the reduction in photosynthesis doesn't directly influence human waste generation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: What has been dubbed Art Week, the annual fest that surrounds Art Basel Miami Beach, has attracted throngs of collectors, enthusiasts and gawkers to South Florida. And, as it turns out, at least one thief.      An unknown burglar — or burglars — swiped a silver plate crafted by Spanish master Pablo Picasso sometime between Thursday night and Friday morning from Art Miami in Midtown, the premier Basel satellite fair.      David Smith, owner of the Amsterdam-based Leslie Smith Gallery, said he arrived at the booth Friday to find an empty holder on the wall where the artwork hung Thursday.      “I’ve been doing art shows all my life. Even when I was a kid, I went with my parents,” said Smith, 45. “I’ve never, ever had anything stolen.”      Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access. SUBSCRIBE NOW      He reported the heist to show organizers and to Miami police, who dusted for fingerprints.      The 1956 piece, Visage aux Mains (Face with Hands), is a 16.5-inch-wide silver plate engraved with a smiling face and stick-finger hands. It’s No. 16 in a 20-plate series, Smith said, and is valued at about 85,000.      “There is no video surveillance or witnesses to this incident,” Det. Frederica Burden, a police spokeswoman, said in an email. A police report of the incident lists the crime as grand theft.      Art Miami is located at 3101 NE First Ave. in a temporary tent facility — guarded by the same company that conducts security for Art Basel, a separate fair at the Miami Beach Convention Center.      At Art Miami, security includes 24-hour guards at entrances and exits, as well as locks and chains on the doors. No video cameras are trained on each booth, which is hardly unusual for art fairs.      “There’s an investigation going on,” said Nick Korniloff, the fair’s director and partner.      Cleaning crews, fair employees and booth operators would have had access to the site overnight, he said. The fair has a list of all personnel allowed to work on the premises.      According to Smith, a security guard did a walk-through at about 10:30 p.m. and the Picasso was still in place. The gallery owner said he himself left Art Miami at about 8:30 p.m. Thursday, with his collection whole. The Picasso had hung there since Monday.      When he walked in at about 10:45 a.m. Friday, Smith said, the piece was gone.      By the time doors opened to fairgoers at 11 a.m., all visitors saw was a label beneath where the purloined Picasso had been. “Signed, numbered & Stamped with silver marks,” the label read in part, describing the piece.      Police asked the gallery to keep the booth untouched as they investigated, which means Smith could hardly focus on selling art in the fair’s first two hours — usually the busiest ones of the day.      “We had to shoo people off the booth,” he said. “I definitely missed people I didn’t speak to.”      Nothing else was missing or appeared disturbed, Smith said. The Picasso plate wasn’t the most valuable artwork on display, according to Smith: For example, a Picasso ceramic just below where the plate was hanging is worth about 365,000. The pilfered piece will be reported to an international database meant to inform art dealers of stolen work.      Smith speculated that the plate might have been small enough for someone to hide under a sweater or jacket. The neighboring ceramic piece was smaller but easier to break — and easier to spot as a Picasso, perhaps making it less attractive to filch.      “If you steal art, if it’s from a famous artist, it’s going to be hard to re-sell,” he said. “Either somebody steals it for himself to keep, or somebody, somewhere, someday will realize it’s stolen.” ||||| MIAMI A silver plate made by famed Spanish artist Pablo Picasso was stolen overnight from a Miami art fair, Art Miami Show Director Nick Korniloff said on Friday.      The piece, called Visage aux Mains (Face with Hands), was one of 20 made by Picasso in the mid-20th century featuring a simple, smiling face at its center with stick-like hands on either side.      The plate, exhibited at the Art Miami fair by Amsterdam-based Leslie Smith Gallery, is valued at 85,000, Korniloff said.      \\"There is no market value for a stolen work of that nature that doesn't come with paperwork or provenance,\\" he added.      In a statement, the Miami Police Department said \\"there is no video surveillance or witnesses to this incident. The investigation continues.\\"      Leslie Smith Gallery Director David Smith could not immediately be reached for comment.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Chalky paint has a matte finish, goes on with minimal prep work, and is easier to scrape off while you’re distressing your furniture. Choose a paint color that matches the aesthetic in the rest of your room.  Chalky paint is not the same as chalkboard paint. Chalkboard paint is meant to be written on with chalk after it dries, while chalky paint just has an ultra-matte finish. You can buy chalky paint from any painting supply store. Adding marks to a table surface or furniture legs can make it seem older than what it actually is. Lightly tap your furniture with the end of a chisel or hammer to make indents in the surface. Make the marks random so it doesn’t look like an intentional pattern.  Wear safety glasses in case any wood accidentally breaks off your furniture. Experiment with different tools around your house to see what kind of marks they make. Use 120-grit sandpaper to roughen the surfaces on your piece of furniture. This helps the paint adhere better so it’s less likely to peel off or chip. Make sure to sand any surface you plan on painting so you get a nice even coat. You do not need to sand unfinished wood furniture. Wet a cleaning cloth with warm water and wring it out until it’s damp. Wipe all of the surfaces you plan on painting to get rid of any dust or dirt that’s on them. Use another cloth to dry any areas that are wet before you start. Dip the ends of the bristles in your paint so there’s only a small amount on your paintbrush. Start from the top of your piece of furniture and work toward the bottom. Apply a thin layer of paint on the surface so it can dry fast and even. When you’re finished with the first coat, leave it to dry overnight. It’s okay if you still see the wood or laminate underneath your first coat of paint. This can help add to the distressed look of the final piece. Once the first coat of paint has dried completely, put another coat of paint on your piece. Again, work from the top of the furniture down toward the bottom, and paint until it has a smooth matte finish. When you’re done, let it dry for 3-4 days so the paint has time to adhere to the furniture. Corners and edges are usually the first parts that wear away over time, so start by distressing them. Use 120-grit sandpaper to rub the dry paint off of the surface to expose the wood or laminate underneath. Apply light pressure so you don’t accidentally remove more than you want.  Add more distress marks where your furniture touches the floor so it looks like it’s been scratched up after moving around a lot. Wipe any dust away with a damp rag so you can easily see where you’ve already distressed the furniture. If you accidentally rub off too much of the paint, you may paint over the area again and start over. Wax acts as a sealant to help protect your furniture from any damage. Dip the end of a cheesecloth in the wax and spread it across the surface of your furniture. Work the wax into the surface in a circular motion until it’s smooth. Continue waxing the entire piece of furniture so it’s sealed.  Furniture wax can be bought from your local hardware or paint supply stores. Wax may take up to 30 days to completely cure, but you can use the furniture after one week.","output":"This article is about how to use chalky paint to create a distressed and aged look on furniture, including painting, distressing, and sealing the piece with furniture wax."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

Her life was filled with heartbreak, as her husband had been tragically taken from her in a violent manner, forcing her to embrace widowhood much earlier than she would have ever wished. Though she faced many struggles and challenges, she showed immense resilience and strength to raise her two sons, Anand and Gopi, on her own. She was determined to provide the best possible life for her children, although her husband's untimely death left the family with very little. One fateful day, as Sulochana was bathing her boys, she heard a commotion outside. Immediately concerned, she let the water out of the tub and rushed to the window to see what was happening. Leela, a young girl from the village, was playing near the river when she slipped and fell into the raging waters. Without hesitation, Sulochana sprinted to the river, shouting for someone to help her save Leela. Her eyes filled with worry, she dove headfirst into the water, swimming hard against the current to reach the struggling girl. Some villagers saw Sulochana's valiant effort and rushed to the river's edge to form a human chain, reaching for her and young Leela, who clung to her savior's back. With strength born of desperation, Sulochana connected with the chain, and the villagers slowly pulled them to safety. However, tragedy struck again when Sulochana was badly injured during the rescue. The accident left her crippled and unable to keep her family together, and her sons were forced to separate. Anand, the elder and more responsible of the two brothers, was taken in by a loving and nurturing couple, who raised him as their own. He grew up in a stable, happy home, surrounded by love and warmth, which ultimately helped him evolve into a model citizen, eventually becoming the village's headmaster at its local school. Gopi, on the other hand, was not so fortunate. He was sent to live with a distant relative, a cruel and heartless man who made his living through illegal means. Gopi, growing up in a harsh and brutal environment, soon found himself taking on his caretaker's traits and becoming involved in a life of crime. Over time, he gained a notorious reputation far and wide, and his name became synonymous with fear and dread to all those who heard it. Years passed, and the brothers led their separate lives, unaware of each other's existence. They had become two entirely different people, shaped by the experiences and environments they had encountered growing up. It seemed like the events of their past were destined to keep them separated, even though they were bound by blood. But fate had different plans for Anand and Gopi. One evening, in the midst of a blinding thunderstorm, the small village at the heart of their story faced an unimaginable tragedy, as a fire raged unchecked, consuming everything in its path. The villagers, caught off guard by the natural disaster, fled in a panic, seeking shelter from the inferno. As the firestorm ravaged Ramgarh, the scattered remnants of Sulochana's family found themselves trapped, facing a brutal end together after years of separation. Consumed by the flames and the fury of the storm, they faced their final moments in a cruel twist of fate, their lives strangely linked together by their love for their mother and a village that had borne witness to their unfolding stories. In the end, the two brothers, Anand and Gopi—so different, yet bound by blood—discovered just how interconnected their fates truly were. The flames and the storm that crashed around them, charring the memories of their past, revealed love, pain, and sacrifice, reminding the world of the power of destiny."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What key details about viktor bushuev  can be extracted from the following bio?

In general, the term \\"sterile\\" refers to something that is devoid of living microorganisms or is free from viable microorganisms that can cause infection.

For instance, a sterile environment or object can be seen as something lifeless, barren, or unproductive, which are generally considered to be negative attributes.

Joseph looked at the butterfly and asked, \\"Hey, what kind of butterfly is that?\\" Lawrence, with all his knowledge of biology, could quickly recognize the butterfly and said, \\"That's a Monarch butterfly! They're orange, black, and white, and they are very special because they travel long distances during their lifetime.\\" Joseph was amazed by Lawrence's ability to know the butterfly's name and facts about it. \\"Wow, that's so cool! How do you know all this, Lawrence?\\" Lawrence replied, \\"I have read lots of books about biology, so I've learned many interesting things about animals and plants. Reading helps me know more about the world around us. Plus, I enjoy it!\\" Joseph became curious and excited to learn more about the living things around him too. So, he asked Lawrence if he could teach him some of the things he's learned from his biology books. Lawrence was more than happy to share his knowledge with his friend, so they spent the afternoon walking through the park, looking at all the different animals and plants. Lawrence explained everything he knew, from the names of birds to the types of flowers they saw. By the end of the day, both Lawrence and Joseph had a wonderful time exploring the beauty of nature together. Joseph was inspired to read more books on biology, and the two friends continued to learn and share their love for the living world around them. From that day on, they became even better friends as they discovered new secrets of the natural world, and they never ran out of things to learn and talk about. And they lived happily ever after, sharing their love for biology and learning with each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Add spaces: TheendofMoslemcontrolofGranadacamewiththesurrenderofthecityin1492byitsMoslemleaderinreturnforthepromiseofsafeconductforhimselfandfamilyalongwithanyMoslemwhochosetogowithhim.","output":"The end of Moslem control of Granada came with the surrender of the city in 1492 by its Moslem leader, in return for the promise of safe conduct for himself and family, along with any Moslem who chose to go with him. The conclusion of Moslem rule in Granada marked a significant milestone in the history of Spain, as well as in the history of the Islamic world. This historic event was the culmination of the long and bloody conflict known as the Reconquista, which was waged between the Christian kingdoms of Northern Spain and the Islamic Moors who had ruled much of the Iberian Peninsula since the early 8th century. The fall of Granada was due in large part to the efforts of the Catholic Monarchs, King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile. United by their marriage in 1469, these two powerful kingdoms were able to combine their military and financial resources to gradually push the Moors out of Spain. In 1482, the Reconquista began to intensify as both sides saw that the time for a decisive confrontation was near. Over the next decade, the Catholic Monarchs launched a series of successful campaigns that saw them conquering many key Moorish strongholds. Eventually, they managed to surround the city of Granada, which had been under Moslem control for centuries, and by 1491 they had launched the decisive siege against the city. Granada's Moslem leader, Emir Muhammad XII, also known as Boabdil, quickly realized that the city's defenses were overwhelmed, and its fall seemed imminent. As a result, Boabdil decided to negotiate the city's surrender in order to save his people from further suffering. According to historical accounts, it was agreed that the city would be handed over to the Catholic Monarchs in exchange for Boabdil's safe passage, along with that of his family and any Moslems who chose to join them. The Moslems who remained in the city were promised the right to practice their religion freely without fear of persecution. On January 2, 1492, Boabdil formally handed over the keys to the city and left Granada with his family and followers. It is said that when he reached the nearby hill known as \\"The Hill of Tears,\\" Boabdil paused to look back at the city one last time and wept at the sight of the lost kingdom. The fall of Granada marked the end of Moslem control of Spain and the successful completion of the Reconquista, which had lasted for almost 800 years. For Spain, Granada's surrender signified not only a great military victory but also the solidification of the Catholic Monarchs' rule, paving the way for the emergence of the modern Spanish state. This historic event also contributed to the eventual decline of Islamic influence in Spain, as the Moors who remained in the kingdom were gradually subjected to forced conversions, harsh restrictions, and periodic expulsions over the next few centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: ieee single precision floating point number in binary?","output":"To convert a number into the IEEE single-precision floating-point format, follow these steps: 1. Determine the sign bit: A positive number will have a sign bit of 0, while a negative number will have a sign bit of 1. 2. Convert the number to binary: For simplicity, let's use the number +6.5 (you can use any number). Converting it to binary, we get 110.1. 3. Normalize the binary number: Normalization means shifting the binary point so that there is a single non-zero digit to the left of the binary point. For our number, 110.1 is already normalized. 4. Determine the exponent: Since the binary point was not shifted during normalization, the exponent is 0. But we need to add a bias of 127 for single-precision representation: 0 + 127 = 127. Convert 127 to binary: 01111111. 5. Determine the significand (mantissa): We only need the digits after the first significant digit (which is always normalized to 1), so the significand for our example is 101. However, the single-precision significand has 23 bits, so we need to pad the remaining bits with zeros: 10100000000000000000000. 6. Combine the sign bit, exponent, and significand: Finally, we can combine all the parts to form the IEEE single-precision floating-point representation:   Sign bit: 0   Exponent: 01111111   Significand: 10100000000000000000000   Put together: 01011111111010000000000000000000 So, the IEEE single-precision floating-point representation of +6.5 in binary is 01011111111010000000000000000000."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Sara's discovery involves cleaning the bathroom floor more efficiently by using wet towels tied to her feet. Wet towels are likely to work better than dry towels because they provide more resistance, not less. The rationale behind this is that a wet towel has a higher level of friction against the floor compared to a dry towel. This increased friction, or resistance, allows the wet towel to better pick up dirt, dust, and other particles from the surface of the floor. In contrast, a dry towel would slide more easily and may not effectively remove dirt and debris.

Is \\"They run perpendicular to the \\"chainlines\\", which are further apart.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, you are correct. In the context of papermaking, laidlines run perpendicular to the chainlines. To provide a more detailed explanation: Papermaking is an ancient art and craft that involves the creation of paper sheets from various sources of fibers or pulps. During the process of papermaking, certain features known as laidlines and chainlines become embedded in the paper, giving it specific characteristics and a unique appearance.  Laidlines and chainlines are formed during the papermaking process when a sheet of paper is created using a paper mold – a wooden frame mounted with a metal wire mesh screen. The wire mesh is made up of closely-spaced horizontal wires, referred to as \\"laidlines,\\" and slightly thicker, more widely-spaced vertical wires called \\"chainlines.\\" These lines are visible when a sheet of paper is held against a light source or examined using transmitted light. Laidlines are the closely-spaced parallel lines that run horizontally across a sheet of paper. They are formed by the thinner wire strands on the mold's mesh and are typically about 1 millimeter apart. Depending on the papermaker, the spacing between these lines may vary in different paper molds. Chainlines, on the other hand, are the thicker, widely-spaced vertical lines running perpendicular to the laidlines. The chainlines are formed by the \\"chain wires,\\" which are sturdier and more substantial than the laid wires and provide additional support to the structure of the mold. Chainlines are generally spaced about 2.5 to 3 centimeters apart, depending on the size of the paper mold and the preferences of the papermaker. Together, the laidlines and chainlines give a sheet of handmade paper its unique wavy texture and appearance, known as \\"laid\\" or \\"watermark.\\" This pattern distinguishes many varieties of handmade paper from machine-made paper, which typically does not possess these distinguishing features. In addition, the presence of such lines allows historians, art conservators, and archivists to assess the age and origin of a sheet of paper and the artworks and documents created on it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Furthermore, when I requested a replacement for an incorrect dish, the situation was not handled with care or attention. Beyond the service, cleanliness was another huge concern. Cutlery and tableware were not properly cleaned, and the overall hygiene of the establishment seemed questionable. It became evident that the management was indifferent towards maintaining the cleanliness of the place, further proving that this establishment is not up to standards. In conclusion, my experience at this establishment was nothing short of miserable. From an unwelcoming start, inconsiderate staff, unappetizing food, terrible service to the glaring lack of cleanliness, I cannot recommend this place to anyone. The whole experience has left me beyond disappointed. My sincere advice is for potential patrons to look elsewhere for a quality dining experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Many couples find that, after living together for a few months, they still have strong feelings for each other and want to stay together as a couple, but struggle to actually live with one another. It is possible to keep a relationship together—the relationship may even become stronger! You should still be clear about what you want; try saying:  “I still want this to be a serious relationship; I care deeply about you.” “I still want to see you regularly (or 'a few times a week,' etc.), but I would like more space than I have now.” “I want you to still feel welcome here, and I want to feel welcome at your new apartment.\\" Asking someone to move out is usually thought of as a negative act, and associated with breakups and unhappy feelings. If you're planning to stay together as a couple, it will be important to the health of your relationship to focus on the good things about your relationship. For example, explain to your boyfriend the ways that living separately will strengthen your relationship. Try saying:  “I think that us living in separate places will allow us to have more feeling of romance and affection in our relationship.” “I feel like you and I will have less conflict and fewer arguments if we don't live together.” “I think you and I will grow closer to each other if don't spend all of our time together.” This is a sensitive and emotional issue, and should be treated as such. Your boyfriend may be hurt that you are asking him to move out, or confused about how this new phase of your relationship is going to work. Remember that relationships involve compromise—if he moves out at your request, you may need to make other compromises in the future. Talk to him and let him know that he's still important to you; make your reasoning clear, then ask if he has any concerns about how moving out will affect your relationship.  Let him know that you see this as a step forward in the relationship; things are improving between you and him, not getting worse. Shortly after your boyfriend has moved out, spend extra time with him or buy him a gift to show that you care about how he feels. Try to keep most other aspects of your relationships stable. If you're staying together after asking your boyfriend to move out, you and he will need to establish some boundaries. Many couples feel that they lose important parts of their personal identity and social lives while living with a partner; talk with your boyfriend about how you and he can each maintain a distinct personal and social life. Now that you don't live together anymore, how will the relationship work? What will it look like on a day-to-day basis? How often will you see one another? This should not only be a conversation that you have inside your head—sit down with your boyfriend and discuss specific activities that you and him can routinely do together that will help your relationship feel fun and normal, and allow you both to get used to the new living situation. For example, try saying:  “I think it would be fun if we had weekly date nights.” “We should spend time together meeting new people outside of our usual social circle.” Summary:","output":"The article suggests that couples struggling to cohabit but wishing to sustain their relationship can consider living separately, emphasizing that in such scenarios, communication about desires and concerns is essential. Furthermore, the author proposes setting boundaries, maintaining individual social lives, and planning regular activities together to keep the relationship strong and enjoyable."},{"instruction":"Question: The trainer told him to keep doing the same exercise, he said he had to keep doing it until he what?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow.... SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK  Was it boring! I almost didn't make it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever. But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That's not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And that's quite a feat. Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner's father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man's brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected. OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It's boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than Ang Lee's, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could. Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee's \\"failure\\". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster.  This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I'd just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course). It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie.  It is to Edward Norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative? Available choices:  + negative.  + positive.","output":"In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer seems to hold a predominantly negative view of both Ang Lee's Hulk and The Incredible Hulk, citing issues with the CGI, the portrayal of characters, and the overall storylines. While they do find some redeeming qualities in Ang Lee's version, like the extended action scene, they ultimately find both films to be underwhelming and disappointing, especially comparing them to other superhero movies."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Article: Hudson boat crash: Personal watercraft rider finds second body      Parishioners gathered Sunday for a morning service at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Pearl River, where the couple involved in Friday's deadly boat crash on the Hudson River, Lindsey Stewart and      A link to this page will be included in your message. ||||| (CNN) -- [Breaking news alert, 1:39 p.m. ET]      Authorities in Piermont, New York, believe that they have recovered the body of Mark Lennon, the second victim of a boating accident involving a wedding party on the Hudson River, Sheriff Louis Falco told reporters Sunday. Lennon was the best man in the group.      [Previously published story, 12:10 p.m. ET]      The path that led Lindsey Stewart and Brian Bond to decide to join their lives together was as measured and deliberate as its end was abrupt.      The two had been friends since they were children living in the suburbs north of New York City. They went to the same church. More than three years ago, the relationship turned romantic.      Next month, the 30-year-old human resources manager at an insurance company in Nyack, and her 36-year-old beau were to marry at Good Shepherd Church in Pearl River.      The reception was to be at Torne Valley Winery in Hillburn.      \\"She did all the plans herself,\\" her stepfather, Walter Kosik, told CNN. \\"She had everything under control.\\"      On Friday night, Stewart and Bond and four of their friends dined at a restaurant, then boarded a 21-foot Stingray power boat on the Hudson River for what was to have been a short ride from the village of Piermont in Rockland County to Tarrytown.      It was a clear, balmy night.      The short ride and the couple's long-term plans collided fatally when the boat struck the side of one of three barges that were lashed together at a construction site near the Tappan Zee Bridge, 25 miles north of Manhattan.      The barges, which were being used by a contractor who is building a new bridge, had been anchored in the river since around April, said Robert Van Cura, undersheriff of the Rockland County Sheriff's Office.      Stewart was thrown from the boat, as was Mark Lennon, who was to have served as the couple's best man.      Despite suffering serious head injuries, Bond, Stewart's fiance, called 911 from the boat at 10:41 p.m., reporting that it had struck an object south of the bridge.      Rescuers poured in from around the area, but to no avail.      At 2:30 a.m. Saturday, the police showed up at the house belonging to Stewart's mother and stepfather.      \\"That's something -- a nightmare -- I don't wish on any parent, to get that police coming over your house waking you out of your sleep to tell you that an accident has occurred,\\" Kosik said.      A few hours later, a body believed to be that of Stewart's was discovered about an eighth of a mile off the riverbank. The search for Lennon, which proved fruitless Saturday, was to resume Sunday morning, but officials held out little hope he would be found alive.      \\"We're always hopeful, but obviously, at this hour, it's less and less likely that this would be a rescue as opposed to a recovery,\\" Van Cura told reporters.      The four who were not thrown from the boat suffered head injuries and were taken to area hospitals.      One of them, boat operator Jojo K. John, 35, was arrested.      \\"We have probable cause to believe that he operated the boat while intoxicated,\\" Van Cura said.      John was arraigned at an area hospital on one count of first-degree vehicular manslaughter and three counts of second-degree vehicular assault, Van Cura said.      More charges are possible, he said.      Van Cura said the operator was not the registered owner of the boat, which may have more than one owner.      Bond was hospitalized at Westchester Medical Center, said Kosik, who visited him Saturday. \\"He was in no condition to talk.\\"      A spokesman for the medical center said Bond was in fair condition.      \\"She's supposed to be married two weeks from today,\\" said Carol Stewart about her daughter. \\"It just can't end like this.\\"      An investigation has begun. \\"The barge had some lights on it; whether or not it was properly lighted is part of the investigation,\\" Van Cura said.      \\"On a clear, moonlit night, with the bridge lights on, you can see pretty well,\\" said Tom Sobolik in a telephone interview from aboard his sailboat near the accident site.      The moon was last full on Monday.      But Craig and Celeste Kmiecik said they were boating in the area on Friday night and that it appeared dark. \\"There was a moon last night, but you really can't see anything,\\" said Craig Kmiecik.      \\"The barge was not lit up,\\" said Celeste Kmiecik. \\"We saw that last night coming back to the marina.\\"      CNN's Alina Cho and Chris Welch contributed to this report. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Sure, sweetie! So this is a sad story about a boat crash. A couple, Lindsey Stewart and Brian Bond, who were going to get married soon, went with some friends on a boat ride at night. Sadly, their boat hit something big in the river, called a barge, which was part of a bridge construction site. Lindsey and their friend Mark Lennon were thrown out of the boat into the water. Brian, who was hurt, called for help, but sadly Lindsey and Mark couldn't be found alive. The police think that the man driving the boat, named Jojo John, might have drunk too much alcohol, which is a big no-no, especially when you're driving something. They also are looking at whether the barge was lit up enough at night. It's a very sad story, honey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Winter is a great time to experiment with new sports. The key is to find one that matches your interests and natural abilities. If you like to walk, keep walking -- on snowshoes. If you want to try an endurance sport, go for cross-country skiing. Besides, snowboarding is just great fun.  Not satisfied with these? Try downhill skiing, then. Downhill skiing is not as hard as it used to be -- shorter, lightweight, curved skis make any beginner feel like an Olympic winner. These newer skis -- along with another type of equipment called skiboards, which are even shorter than skis -- help you control your speed and body movements.  Consider testing the latest high-tech skis or snowboards?Check with your local sports shops or the rental places at the ski mountains about sample programs.  You could also try sledding. Use a wood-framed sled with steel runners or a plastic sled to head down a snowy hill. If you prefer ice to snow, think hockey or figure skating.  Runners can also train during the winter in spite of wet or slippery roads. One of the easiest sports around, snowshoeing can be excellent cold-weather cross-training for runners and cyclists -- or anyone wanting to take a wintry walk in the woods. Snowshoes are smaller, lighter, and better than ever. If you want to try them out, you may be able to rent a pair for a day at many of the larger outdoor or sporting goods stores.  Whatever sport you choose, don't rely on a friend for instruction. You wouldn't let an inexperienced doctor perform a brain operation on you, but why let one teach you to ski or skate? That's what instructors are for -- to help newcomers start out right. Instructors can give you advice about equipment, techniques, safety, and dealing with injuries if they do happen to you.  Above all, if you want to progress, invest your time in learning the basic skills thoroughly. Everything else you do as a skier, boarder, or skater will be built on these first skills. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Answer: Choose your answer from: (a). Runners and cyclists cannot train because of the wet or slippery roads in winter.; (b). Downhill skiing used to be more difficult to learn because of the old-fashioned skis.; (c). People can rent snowshoes for a day at their local sports shops or the rental places.; (d).

Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command:   1. count: returns the number of rows in the view.   2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view.   3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row.   4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments.   5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column.   6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column.   7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column.   8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column.   9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal.   10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance.   11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument.   12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments.   13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument.   14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument.   15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument.   16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table   17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.   20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. Input: eq { hop { argmin { all_rows ; first air date } ; city } ; townsville } Output:","output":"This command falls under the category \\"unique\\".  Let's break down the command: eq { hop { argmin { all_rows ; first air date } ; city } ; townsville } The 'eq' operation is asking whether two parameters are equal. The first parameter is derived from 'hop { argmin { all_rows ; first air date } ; city }'. Here, 'argmin' is used to get the row with the minimum 'first air date' and 'hop' moves to the 'city' column of this unique row.  The second argument of 'eq' is 'townsville'. This operation compares the city from the selected row and 'townsville'.  Overall, this command is identifying one unique row from the table where the city of the earliest 'first air date' record matches with 'townsville'. Hence, it belongs to the category 'unique'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him. But many researchers, especially at the start of their careers, don’t... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

McDonagh discussed the creative process, saying that it took him about ten years to \`\`(decide) that it was a mother who had taken these things out. It all became fiction (...) based on a couple of actual billboards''.

McDonagh came across billboards accusing the police of incompetence concerning an unsolved crime, which moved him deeply. These billboards, in conjunction with his ambition to create strong female characters, served as the basis for the film's narrative. Though the incident of the billboards was real, Martin McDonagh's creative process transformed and fictionalized it into the story present in the film. Over a period of approximately ten years, he adapted the concept and introduced the character of a mother putting up the billboards as a pivotal figure in the narrative.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you rinse a bowl of blueberries? Possible answers:  *Place the bowl in the sink under the faucet, turn on the faucet until water covers the berries, swish the berries in the water with your hand, tip the bowl enough to drain the water without letting the berries fall out..  *Place the bowl in the bathtub under the faucet, turn on the faucet until water covers the berries, swish the berries in the water with your hand, tip the bowl enough to drain the water without letting the berries fall out..","output":"Between the two options given, the better solution for rinsing a bowl of blueberries would be placing the bowl in the sink under the faucet, turning on the faucet until water covers the berries, swishing the berries in the water with your hand, and tipping the bowl enough to drain the water without letting the berries fall out.  Here are the reasons why this option is considered better: 1. Accessibility: The sink is usually located in the kitchen, where the blueberries are likely to be stored and used, making it a convenient and easily accessible location for rinsing. The average consumer spends most of their food preparation time in the kitchen, making the proximity of the sink a logical choice. 2. Cleanliness: Sinks are designated primarily for cleaning dishes, utensils, and produce, so they are generally more sanitary than the bathtub. Bathtubs are used for personal hygiene and bathing, and may contain soap residue, hair, or other contaminants. Rinsing your blueberries in the bathtub could expose them to these unwanted contaminants, affecting the quality and safety of your food. 3. Efficiency: The faucet in the kitchen sink usually has a higher water pressure and flow rate compared to the bathtub faucet. This means that it is more efficient at rinsing the blueberries, as it allows for quicker filling of the bowl and better agitation of the water to dislodge dirt, debris, or pesticides. 4. Control: Kitchen sinks often have more precise control over water temperature, allowing you to rinse the blueberries with water that is not too hot or too cold. This helps prevent damage to the blueberries and ensures a more effective cleaning process. 5. Ergonomics: The height of the kitchen sink is typically more appropriate for tasks such as rinsing blueberries, as it allows for comfortable standing and less strain on the back. In contrast, using the bathtub faucet would require bending at the waist or kneeling, which can be more uncomfortable and less ergonomic for the user. 6. Drainage: Kitchen sinks usually have proper drainage systems, like a garbage disposal, to handle debris from rinsing produce. Bathtubs, on the other hand, may not have such a system, so rinsing the blueberries in the bathtub could potentially cause clogging or other drainage issues. In summary, rinsing a bowl of blueberries in the kitchen sink under the faucet is a more convenient, hygienic, efficient, controlled, ergonomic, and safe option when compared to using the bathtub for this task."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: This study examined the impact of omentin on myocardial injury in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and explored its underlying mechanisms.', 'Obesity is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease. Omentin is a circulating adipokine that is down-regulated by obesity.', 'In patients who underwent successful reperfusion treatment after acute myocardial infarction, cardiac function and perfusion defect were assessed by using scintigraphic images. Mice were subjected to myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion.', 'This study found that high levels of plasma omentin were associated with improvement of heart damage and function after reperfusion therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Systemic administration of human omentin to mice led to a reduction in myocardial infarct size and apoptosis after I/R, which was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Akt in the ischemic heart. Fat-specific overexpression of human omentin also resulted in reduction of infarct size after I/R. Blockade of AMPK or Akt activity reversed omentin-induced inhibition of myocardial ischemic damage and apoptosis in mice. In cultured cardiomyocytes, omentin suppressed hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis, which was blocked by inactivation of AMPK or Akt. Answer: Our data indicate that omentin functions as an adipokine that ameliorates acute ischemic injury in the heart by suppressing myocyte apoptosis through both AMPK- and Akt-dependent mechanisms.

Choose from options, is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Gas escaped the tube. Available options: [A]. unacceptable [B]. acceptable","output":"[B]. Acceptable The sentence \\"Gas escaped the tube\\" is an acceptable formation in English grammar. Here's a more detailed look into each component of the sentence and why it is linguistically correct: 1. Subject: \\"Gas\\" - \\"Gas\\" is a general term used to refer to any substance in a state of matter where particles can freely move and fill up their container, like air or helium. Here, it's used as the subject of the sentence, meaning it's the element or person performing the action or verb.  2. Verb: \\"escaped\\" - \\"Escaped\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"escape.\\" In English, it's common to use this type of verb to express an action that occurred in the past. In the context of this sentence, \\"escaped\\" conveys that the action of the gas leaving the tube has already happened. 3. Object: \\"the tube\\" - \\"Tube\\" is a common English noun that usually refers to a long, hollow cylinder that's typically made of metal or plastic. \\"The\\" is a definite article that specifies the exact tube from which the gas escaped, implying that the tube mentioned was already known or specified in prior conversation or context.  So, to put it together: the subject (Gas) performed an action in the past (escaped), and it was done to a specific object (the tube). This sentence is simple, but it completely fits the Subject-Verb-Object word order that's typical in English, along with using the right tense to show that the action was done in the past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"One never knows.\\"\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"One always knows.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"One never knows.\\", it is not accurate to conclude that the hypothesis \\"One always knows.\\" is true. Both statements, essentially, represent two opposite ends of a spectrum when it comes to human knowledge and understanding - complete uncertainty and total certainty, respectively. To analyze these assertions, we must first break them down and explore their underlying implications. The premise \\"One never knows.\\" suggests that uncertainty is a fundamental characteristic of human nature. Life is unpredictable, full of surprises, and people are continually faced with new situations, challenges, and information. Knowledge is not static, and what we know may change over time as new discoveries are made, experiences are gained, or perspectives shift. This statement acknowledges that human understanding is limited and implies that humans are incapable of omniscience - possessing complete knowledge about all subjects and matters. This uncertainty can stem from various sources, such as lack of information, individual and societal biases, cognitive limitations, or even existential and philosophical uncertainty, like the ultimate meaning of life. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"One always knows.\\" posits that human beings possess absolute certainty and that, by extension, our understanding of the world we live in is complete and unwavering. While this assertion may appear ambitious and perhaps encouraging, it fails to recognize the inherent fallibility of human nature. Mistakes, biases, contradicting beliefs, and lack of comprehensive information frequently influence our understanding and shape the way we perceive the world. Moreover, the notion of \\"always knowing\\" also encounters challenges in realms like philosophy, ethics, and morality, where many questions lack universally agreed-upon answers. Concepts such as cultural relativism and subjectivism further underscore the notion that our grasp of knowledge is continuous as our perspectives grow and evolve. In conclusion, rather than supporting one another, the premises \\"One never knows.\\" and \\"One always knows.\\" represent two competing perspectives on the nature of human knowledge and understanding. The former emphasizes the inevitability of uncertainty and incompleteness, whereas the latter suggests an unrealistic scenario of absolute certainty and omniscience. The truth lies somewhere in between these two extremes. As humans, we strive to continually learn, adapt, and grow, overcoming our limitations and encountering new information that challenges our existing beliefs. Despite our efforts and progress, we must simultaneously acknowledge and accept our inherent fallibility and the ever-changing nature of knowledge and understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold. My favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive. Tom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story. The theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior. Why do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story.

Some of their well-known hits include \\"Java Jive,\\" \\"Birdland,\\" \\"The Boy from New York City,\\" and \\"Chanson D'Amour.\\" The original lineup underwent a change in 1979 when Laurel Masse left the group due to a car accident and was subsequently replaced by Cheryl Bentyne. This revised lineup of Tim Hauser, Cheryl Bentyne, Alan Paul, and Janis Siegel continued to perform and record together for many years. Sadly, Tim Hauser passed away in 2014, but The Manhattan Transfer continues to perform and carry on their impressive legacy with Trist Curless taking Hauser's place. Throughout their illustrious career, The Manhattan Transfer has earned numerous honors and accolades. They have won 10 Grammy Awards, including the first Grammy awarded for \\"Best Jazz Fusion Vocal or Instrumental Performance\\" for their 1980 album, \\"Extensions.\\" In 1998, they became the first group ever to win Grammy Awards in both pop and jazz categories simultaneously.

In conclusion, The Manhattan Transfer, initially made up of Tim Hauser, Laurel Masse, Alan Paul, and Janis Siegel, is a highly influential and innovative American vocal group. Their unique blend of jazz, pop, R&B, and doo-wop, along with their impressive vocal harmonies and arrangements, have made them a mainstay in the music industry for several decades.

I have a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  But I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  What is an answer for this question: Which country would have higher labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","output":"Based on the Laffer curve and the background information provided, Germany would have a higher labor supply in response to their taxation policies. Since West Germany implemented tax rates below the critical rate, this would encourage a higher labor supply as workers and businesses are less burdened by taxation. On the other hand, France implemented tax rates above the critical rate, which could lead to a decline in labor supply due to the increased burden on businesses and workers. Therefore, in comparison, Germany's pro-capitalist approach to taxation would likely result in a higher labor supply."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Private health insurance exchanges still are not able to directly enroll consumers in subsidized health plans offered through Obamacare even though the government has said problems doing so should have been cleared up weeks ago. Executives from three online health exchanges that contract with both insurance companies and government agencies to enroll consumers eligible for federal subsidies in marketplace plans say the process still isn't ready to go and that more work remains. This despite several promises from government officials that technical fixes have been made to allow for business to be conducted on those sites, which are alternatives to the troubled HealthCare.gov website and health exchanges sites run by states. The direct enrollment process designed by the Department of Health and Human Services would allow private marketplaces to direct consumers to a federal data hub to confirm their eligibility for government assistance, and then allow them to return to the third-party sites to enroll. \\"We're not going to launch anything that doesn't work, but we can't even start testing for a while yet,\\" said eHealth.com CEO Gary Lauer, weeks after the first round of fixes were announced in mid-November. \\"We're still going through all of this. The stuff we've had up to this point has been junk, and that's why I'm so concerned about this. It may not work,\\" he said. Officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency overseeing HealthCare.gov, announced in November several fixes that were supposed to allow for direct enrollment through private issuers within a matter of days. After the announcement, consumers should have been able to compare plans on a private exchange, visit HealthCare.gov to receive their subsidy eligibility, and then be directed back to the private site to complete enrollment. \\"We believe more improvements need to be made before it's stable enough and consumer-friendly enough,\\" said Michael Mahoney, senior vice president of consumer marketing at GoHealth.com, another private online health insurance exchange. Launched in 2010, GoHealth has been participating in an alternate form of direct enrollment since late November, but visitors to the site still cannot complete the entire process online as CMS officials promised. Shoppers can compare plans and get an estimate of what kind of subsidy they may qualify for through the GoHealth system, but in order to officially determine their eligibility and enroll in a plan consumers must call a GoHealth call center. \\"We're still working with CMS on a solution where you don't have to interact over the phone,\\" Mahoney said. Other private exchanges are also using their call centers as a workaround, but one official said companies are still working towards the \\"holy grail,\\" when customers can enroll online from start to finish. In November, officials at GetInsured.com told CNN they believed they were days away from launching such a process on their site. But weeks later, company spokeswoman Andrea Riggs said the direct enrollment process is still not ready for public use even though her company has been in near-daily contact with CMS. \\"We're not going to put it in front of the consumer and make noise about it until it's a great experience,\\" Riggs said. During congressional testimony on December 11, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius pointed to direct enrollment as a viable option for those who have had trouble enrolling on HealthCare.gov, which experienced enormous problems upon its October 1 launch and was only recently brought up to speed. In response to a question from Georgia Republican Rep. John Barrow about ways consumers can enroll in insurance outside of the troubled federal website, Sebelius said that private online options were available. \\"I know that the e-surance, e-health brokers have a variety of plans available,\\" Sebelius said. \\"I can't tell you how broad-based that is, but I know a number of companies, you can either sign up in person with an agent or broker or sign up online.\\" The secretary quickly clarified that in order to check whether a consumer is eligible for a premium subsidy, private issuers had to first check in with the federal data hub. But when pushed, she assured Barrow that online exchanges were participating in the process. \\"The e-health insurance folks are now engaged and involved, the brokers involved in that,\\" Sebelius said. \\"The companies are directly involved, as well as individuals navigating on their own.\\" While some individual insurance companies are currently using direct enrollment to sign up new customers on their company websites, CMS officials could not point to any private exchanges successfully using the process the way it was intended. Through private exchanges, consumers can compare plans offered by multiple providers, filter them by coverage features, and even get free advice as to what kind of coverage they may need. Insurance company sites only allow consumers to choose from plans offered by that specific company. Lauer said the government is making a mistake by not making it easier for private exchanges like his company to enroll customers, calling the redirect system designed by CMS \\"byzantine.\\" Describing himself as a supporter-turned-critic of the ACA, Lauer said at the current pace, he doesn't see how the government can reach its projection of 7 million enrollees using just HealthCare.gov and 14 state-run exchanges. \\"There's absolutely no reason why we shouldn't be connected directly to the federal data hub, we've got all kinds of security and requirements built into the regulation,\\" Lauer said, referring to the contract his company signed with CMS. \\"If they want more regulations, more requirements, bring 'em on. If they want to audit us every day, come on in.\\" Officials from all three companies CNN spoke with acknowledged that they stand to make money from a surge in online enrollment, but they all emphasized that the advice and assistance provided by their sites is free to consumers. Private exchanges get paid by insurance companies for the customers they sign up. Meaning their service is not only free to consumers, but also to taxpayers. Highlights:","output":"- Private health insurance exchanges are still unable to directly enroll consumers in Obamacare's subsidized health plans even though the government said the issue would be fixed weeks ago. - The direct enrollment process designed by the Department of Health and Human Services would allow private marketplaces to direct consumers to a federal data hub to confirm their eligibility for government assistance, and then allow them to return to the third-party sites to enroll. - Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, pointed to direct enrollment as a viable option for those who have had trouble enrolling on HealthCare.gov.

Given the following context:  The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose publisher was Giulio ?

Question: Why did people immigrate to Portugal? Context: Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants.

Police \\"fully inspected\\" the tunnel before reopening it, Windsor authorities said. The bomb threat led to traffic backups as drivers on both sides of the border were rerouted. Employees at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel received an anonymous phone call around 12:30 p.m. from someone saying there was a bomb in the tunnel, Sgt. Matthew D'Asti with Windsor police told HLN. Authorities were working together on both sides of the border to investigate and search the tunnel for any possible device, D'Asti said. Neal Belitsky, president and CEO of Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, said the threat was called in to the Canadian side. Authorities treated the matter \\"as a nonspecific, anonymous bomb threat,\\" said D'Asti. The tunnel was evacuated. The tunnel is one of two international crossings between the cities of Windsor and Detroit. Traffic was being routed to the other, a bridge about two miles away. Approximately 27,000 to 29,000 vehicles pass daily through the tunnel, which opened in 1930. The Coast Guard said it set up a safety zone in the Detroit River in order to keep vessels away from the tunnel. CNN's Chandler Friedman, Devon Sayers and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

Hole was an American alternative rock band formed by singer and guitarist Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson in Los Angeles, California in 1989. Influenced by Los Angeles' punk rock scene, and produced by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, the band's debut album, Pretty on the Inside (1991), attracted critical interest from British and American alternative press. Their second album, Live Through This, released 1994 by DGC Records, which featured less aggressive melodies and more restrained lyrical content, was widely acclaimed and reached platinum status within a year of its release. Their third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), which garnered them four Grammy nominations, marked a notable departure from their earlier punk influences, boasting a more commercially viable, \\"mature\\" sound. In the winter of 1998-99, Hole went on tour to promote Celebrity Skin, joining Marilyn Manson, who was promoting his album, Mechanical Animals (1998) on the \\"Beautiful Monsters Tour\\". The tour turned into a publicity magnet, and Hole dropped out of the tour nine dates in, due to both the majority of the fans being Manson's, and the 50/50 financial arrangement between the groups, with Hole's production costs being disproportionately less than Manson's. Manson and Love often mocked one another onstage, and Love attacked Manson's stage antics, which included tearing up a Bible during performances: \\"You know, whenever somebody rips up the Bible in front of 40,000 people, I think it's a big deal,\\" she said during a 1999 interview. Hole officially announced that they would be dropping out of the tour after a poorly received concert at the Rose Garden Arena in Portland, Oregon, which ended with Manson fans booing the band.  The band continued to book shows and headline festivals after dropping off Manson's tour, and according to Auf der Maur, it was a \\"daily event\\" for Love to invite audience members onstage to sing with her for the last song at nearly every concert performance. On June 18, 1999 during Hole's set at the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, a 19-year-old girl died after being crushed by the mosh pit behind the mixing board. Hole played its final show at Thunderbird Stadium in Vancouver on July 14, 1999.  In October 1999, Auf der Maur quit Hole and went on to become a touring bassist for The Smashing Pumpkins. Samantha Maloney also quit a few months later. The band's final release was a single for the movie Any Given Sunday (1999). \\"Be a Man\\", released in March 2000, was an outtake from the Celebrity Skin sessions. Love and Erlandson officially disbanded Hole via a message posted on the band's website in 2002. After the split, the four musicians each took on projects of their own: Erlandson continued to work as a producer and session musician, eventually forming the experimental group RRIICCEE with controversial artist Vincent Gallo. Love began a solo career, releasing her debut, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. Melissa Auf der Maur also embarked on a solo career, and released her self-titled debut album in 2004, which included Erlandson performing lead guitar on the track, \\"Would If I Could.\\" Her second album, Out of Our Minds, was released in March 2010.

Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they overcome the monsters, but as they reach the gates of the palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock in the midst of a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight. In the palace garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is protected from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, but as they touch the garden with their wands it disappears, leaving them all on an empty plain with the city of Jerusalem visible in the distance. Armida, after a last attempt to kill Almirena, also disappears as Rinaldo strikes her with his sword. The remaining four celebrate their reunion, while Goffredo announces that the attack on Jerusalem will begin the next day.

(CNN) -- Casey Anthony is responsible for the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, a report released Thursday by Florida's Department of Children and Families concludes.  A month after a jury acquitted Anthony on murder and child neglect charges, the state agency found that Anthony \\"is the caregiver responsible for the verified maltreatments of death, threatened harm and failure to protect\\" in her daughter's death.  Carrie Hoeppner, a spokeswoman for the Department of Children and Families, said the report was issued this week as a \\"professional courtesy\\" after the sheriff's office and prosecutors finished their work on the case.  She added that the state agency is mandated to conduct reviews when there are allegations that a child dies as a result of abuse, abandonment or neglect. The agency had no contact with the Anthonys prior to the girl's disappearance in the summer of 2008, Hoeppner added.  The Orange County Sheriff's Office will not take any further action as a result of the report, Capt. Angelo Nieves said Thursday.  \\"This closes out the DCF case, and it does not create additional follow-up on our part,\\" he said.  The report said: \\"The Department of Children and Families concludes that the actions or the lack of actions by the alleged perpetrator ultimately resulted or contributed in the death of the child.\\" The report was signed by officials in the department Wednesday.  Anthony is now free. While she was cleared on murder and aggravated child abuse charges, the 25-year-old Orlando woman was convicted on four counts related to misleading law enforcement authorities. She was sentenced to four years in jail on those convictions, but was given credit for the time she had already served between her arrest and the end of the seven-week trial and was released from jail in mid-July. Prosecutors cannot appeal the acquittals.  Answer this series of questions: 1. What is the name of the little girl in the story? 2. How old was she? 3. Did she die? 4. Who is responsible for that? 5.

The Esquisses of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, Les cloches (The Bells), to the strident tone clusters of no. 45, Les diablotins (The Imps), and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, Laus Deo (Praise God). They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled Sonatine, Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of \\"ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.\\"Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces. Alkan's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his Benedictus, Op. 54 (1859). In the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes (1859, without opus number), which, in Smith's opinion, \\"seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space\\", and which he believes reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty.\\" These were followed by pieces such as the 13 Prières (Prayers), Op. 64 (1865), and the Impromptu sur le Choral de Luther \\"Un fort rempart est notre Dieu\\" , op. 69 (1866). Alkan also issued a book of 12 studies for the pedalboard alone (no opus number, 1866) and the Bombardo-carillon for pedalboard duet (four feet) of 1872.Alkan's return to the concert platform at his Petits Concerts, however, marked the end of his publications; his final work to be issued was the Toccatina, Op. 75, in 1872.","output":"The name of the person who believes that the set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes, published in 1859, reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty\\" is Smith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to attract eastern bluebirds  Choose high quality nesting boxes.  Providing a secure nesting location is one of the best ways to attract bluebirds to your property. Whether you purchase or build your nesting boxes, its important to make sure that they are good quality so they will last a long time.","output":"Additionally, it is essential to select nesting boxes that are constructed from long-lasting, weather-resistant materials, like cedar or recycled plastic composites, promoting proper ventilation and drainage. The design of the nesting box should facilitate easy access for bluebirds while deterring predators and other competitors. Installing predator guards or baffles can also help improve the safety of your nesting boxes. Furthermore, the entrance hole should be the right size (1.5 inches in diameter) to allow eastern bluebirds in but preventing larger, more aggressive birds like European Starlings and House Sparrows from taking over. It's also beneficial to have a clean-out door on the nesting box to ensure simple end-of-season cleanups and better sanitation for potential new bluebird families in the coming years. To maximize the chances of attracting bluebirds, it's crucial to find the perfect spot for your nesting boxes. Eastern Bluebirds prefer open, grassy areas with scattered trees or shrubs, where they can spot insects to feast on and escape to nearby perches if necessary. The ideal location for a nesting box is 4 to 6 feet above the ground, facing southeast (to avoid strong winds and weather exposure) and at least 100 yards away from other birdhouses since bluebirds are territorial creatures. In addition to providing a suitable nesting environment, consider complementing your efforts by offering an inviting food source like mealworms, which are a favorite of bluebirds. Setting up a mealworm feeder nearby can entice these beautiful birds to spend more time in the vicinity of the nesting boxes. Furthermore, having a clean water source, such as a birdbath or shallow pond, not only benefits bluebirds and other avian visitors but also creates an overall more attractive habitat. Lastly, be patient and persistent in your endeavours to attract eastern bluebirds. It may take time for bluebirds to find and occupy a given nesting box, but with the right combination of high-quality nesting boxes, strategic placement, supplementary food sources, and habitat improvements, you can significantly enhance your chances of welcoming these vibrant feathered friends to your property and support the conservation efforts for this once-threatened species."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association...

Step-by-step: (1) Determine your fitness goals and preferences; (2) Choose a suitable exercise program or activity; (3) Create a schedule and commit to being consistent; (4) Monitor progress and adjust as needed; (5) Stay motivated and enjoy the process. 2. Hobbies: Nurturing Personal Interests and Passions Hobbies provide a much-needed break from routine, allowing individuals to explore their interests and passions. Engaging in creative and enjoyable activities can help relieve stress, improve cognitive skills, boost confidence and self-esteem, and encourage essential life skills, such as problem-solving and critical thinking. Step-by-step: (1) Identify your interests and passions; (2) Research potential hobbies that align with your preferences; (3) Allocate time and resources to develop your chosen hobby; (4) Network with others who share similar interests; (5) Enjoy the growth and satisfaction that comes from pursuing your hobby. 3. Volunteer: Giving Back and Making a Difference Volunteer work offers a unique opportunity to contribute to the local community, foster social connections, and develop a sense of fulfillment. Volunteering can increase self-awareness, improve interpersonal skills, and even advance career prospects by broadening experiences and enhancing one's resume. Step-by-step: (1) Determine your values, passions, and available time for volunteering; (2) Research organizations and causes that align with your interests; (3) Reach out to the chosen organization and inquire about volunteer opportunities; (4) Commit to a consistent schedule and be reliable; (5) Reflect on the impact of your contributions and personal growth. 4. Positivity: Cultivating an Optimistic Mindset Maintaining a positive attitude is essential for personal well-being, happiness, and overall life satisfaction. Positivity enables individuals to better cope with challenges, view setbacks as temporary, and focus on constructive solutions. Embracing an optimistic mindset can improve emotional resilience, relationships, goal achievement, and even physical health. Step-by-step: (1) Acknowledge your thoughts and emotions; (2) Challenge negative thoughts with a more balanced perspective; (3) Practice gratitude by regularly appreciating the good in life; (4) Surround yourself with positive influences; (5) Engage in activities that foster happiness and contentment.

Clayton Williams, 20, ploughed into PC Dave Phillips, 34, during a high-speed police pursuit in October 2015. The officer was attempting to deploy a stinger device when Williams hit him. The Court of Appeal upheld the length of the sentence given to Williams, who was convicted of manslaughter in 2016. Dismissing Williams' appeal, judge Sir Brian Leveson said: \\"In our judgement he (Williams) cannot have any complaint with the sentence passed upon him. It was thoroughly deserved. \\"Severe punishment will be imposed on all those who kill or injure police officers.\\" Merseyside officer PC Phillips was struck in Wallasey after responding to reports of a burglary in Woodchurch Road, Birkenhead, with a colleague. The married father-of-two died shortly after arriving at hospital. Adam Davis QC argued Williams had been sentenced to \\"very many years, far in excess of what was appropriate on the facts of the case\\". \\"Is this so grave a crime that merited a sentence of 20 years for a 19 year old?\\" he said. Rejecting the argument, Sir Brian agreed with the trial judge that this had been a \\"very grave offence of manslaughter\\". He said Williams' age was taken into account when he was sentenced. Williams was 19 when he was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter at Manchester Crown Court. He ordered to serve 20 years, initially in a young offenders institution, and was also banned from driving for life. Williams was found not guilty of attempting to wound another police officer.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included Ian Underwood (reeds, keyboards), Ruth Underwood (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), Napoleon Murphy Brock (sax, flute and vocals), Bruce Fowler (trombone), Tom Fowler (bass), Chester Thompson (drums), Ralph Humphrey (drums), George Duke (keyboards, vocals), and Jean-Luc Ponty (violin). By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also distributed by Warner Bros. Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No. 10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the No. 86 chart hit \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\\". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as \\"Dinah-Moe Humm\\" and \\"Montana\\", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as \\"Inca Roads\\", \\"Echidna's Arf (Of You)\\" and \\"Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)\\". A live recording from 1974, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures \\"the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band\\". Zappa released Bongo Fury (1975), which featured a live recording at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period. They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of Zappa's life. Answer:","output":"DiscReet Records"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

John Gielgud, a renowned Shakespearean actor, portrayed Cassius, and Greer Garson appeared as Calpurnia, Caesar's wife. Deborah Kerr, though not in the original stage production, played Portia, the wife of Brutus. The movie stays quite true to the original play, telling the story of Julius Caesar's rise and eventual assassination at the hands of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius. The film's screenplay, adapted directly from Shakespeare's text, retains much of the rich language and famous lines, such as \\"Beware the Ides of March\\" and \\"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.\\" The 1953 film version of \\"Julius Caesar\\" was well-received by both audiences and critics, garnering five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor (for Marlon Brando).

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  and the situation: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world.

Bernard Lewis, FBA (born 31 May 1916) is a British American historian specializing in oriental studies. He is also known as a public intellectual and political commentator. Lewis is the Cleveland E. Dodge Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University. Lewis' expertise is in the history of Islam and the interaction between Islam and the West. In 1936, Lewis graduated from the School of Oriental Studies (now School of Oriental and African Studies, SOAS) at the University of London with a BA in history with special reference to the Near and Middle East. He earned his PhD three years later, also from SOAS, specializing in the history of Islam. Lewis also studied law, going part of the way toward becoming a solicitor, but returned to study Middle Eastern history. He undertook post-graduate studies at the University of Paris, where he studied with the orientalist Louis Massignon and earned the \\"Diplome des Etudes Semitiques\\" in 1937. He returned to SOAS in 1938 as an assistant lecturer in Islamic History.  During the Second World War, Lewis served in the British Army in the Royal Armoured Corps and as a Corporal in the Intelligence Corps in 1940-41 before being seconded to the Foreign Office. After the war, he returned to SOAS. In 1949, at the age of 33, he was appointed to the new chair in Near and Middle Eastern History.  In 1974, aged 57, Lewis accepted a joint position at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study, also located in Princeton, New Jersey. The terms of his appointment were such that Lewis taught only one semester per year, and being free from administrative responsibilities, he could devote more time to research than previously. Consequently, Lewis's arrival at Princeton marked the beginning of the most prolific period in his research career during which he published numerous books and articles based on previously accumulated materials. After retiring from Princeton in 1986, Lewis served at Cornell University until 1990.  In 1966, Lewis was a founding member of the learned society, Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), but in 2007 he broke away and founded Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa (ASMEA) to challenge MESA, which the New York Sun noted as \\"dominated by academics who have been critical of Israel and of America's role in the Middle East.\\" The organization was formed as an academic society dedicated to promoting high standards of research and teaching in Middle Eastern and African studies and other related fields, with Lewis as Chairman of its academic council.  In 1990, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Lewis for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. His lecture, entitled \\"Western Civilization: A View from the East\\", was revised and reprinted in The Atlantic Monthly under the title \\"The Roots of Muslim Rage.\\" His 2007 Irving Kristol Lecture, given to the American Enterprise Institute, was published as Europe and Islam.

Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.

Review: I rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch, and Timothy Leary to make a movie, this would be the end result. I don't think I've seen a movie like it that made an LSD trip look like an episode of Sesame Street. It's a bunch of set pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality, or various realities, and the film doesn't culminate into anything until the last 5 minutes, where all of a sudden it makes sense. I wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away, and I won't do that here. It's a well acted piece of cinema, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say this, if there's one redeeming feature to this film, it's the music. It fits perfectly. Some of the dialogue is unbelievably good, and unbelievably bad all at the same time. I enjoyed parts of this movie, I truly did, and once you get to the end of it, you'll actually figure out what's truly going on. It's unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of crazy to get to a salient point, which minimizes the effect of the entire movie. I give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film isn't the acting, it's everything. Now, what is this review like?

The MAUD Committee reports urged the co-operation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed.

United boss Louis van Gaal wants to sign Vermaelen in a £12million deal. Vermaelen has grown frustrated at a lack of opportunities at Arsenal. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is ready to offer Vermaelen a new deal.","output":"Title: Arsenal Captain Thomas Vermaelen Eyeing Manchester United Move Post-World Cup Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen has reportedly confided in close friends that he is strongly considering a move to Manchester United after the World Cup. With United's new boss Louis van Gaal showing interest in signing the Belgian defender in a £12 million deal, Vermaelen may just be on the brink of switching sides. The recent developments have come to light as the player grows increasingly frustrated due to limited opportunities at Arsenal. Thomas Vermaelen has been a part of Arsenal since 2009 when he signed with the club after leaving Ajax. Initially, the defender made a strong impact within the squad and was subsequently named captain in 2012 – a testament to his importance at the club. However, over time, Vermaelen has faced stiff competition for a starting spot in the team, thereby putting his position and long-term future plans in jeopardy. United boss Louis van Gaal has expressed his desire to bolster the team's defense ahead of the new season - an essential decision following the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic from the club. Vermaelen, having demonstrated his ability both as a center-back and left-back, could be the answer Van Gaal is looking for to offer a stable and experienced presence at the heart of the defense. Moreover, in the light of Vermaelen’s team-leading skills, there is significant potential for a smooth transition in acclimating to the demands of his potential new club. While the prospect of moving to Manchester United appears to be enticing for Vermaelen, any final decision is bound to demand careful consideration. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has shown his intent to keep the Belgian in his squad by offering him a new deal. Wenger's potential offer may throw a spanner in the works, as Vermaelen, who still holds the captaincy at Arsenal, must weigh the opportunities and possibilities both clubs present. Overall, a potential move to Manchester United by Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen seems to be gaining momentum as the 2014 FIFA World Cup comes to an end. With a £12 million deal on the table and the allure of more playing time, it is up to the defender to decide his future. Arsene Wenger's willingness to put forward a new deal reflects the player's value to the Arsenal squad, but Vermaelen's grievances regarding his lack of opportunities could be the deciding factor in this transfer saga. The final decision lies in Vermaelen's hands, but one thing is for certain - the conclusion of the World Cup will mark the beginning of an intense battle for his signature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By. Will Stewart and Leon Watson. PUBLISHED:. 07:07 EST, 26 March 2012. |. UPDATED:. 17:57 EST, 28 March 2012. A Moscow oligarch whose attempted killers were allegedly fingered by the banker shot in London has claimed Russian 'terrorism' has arrived on Britain's streets. Alexander Antonov spoke out in support of German Gorbuntsov, 45, now in a coma after being gunned down in a suspected contract killing attempt last Tuesday. Shortly before the attack the wounded banker had given evidence implicating his own associates in an earlier mafia-style assassination bid against Mr Antonov, a key figure in the Converse Bank empire. Coma: German Gorbuntsov (left) was repeatedly shot outside a block of flats near Canary Wharf in an attempted assassination. There are now also fears for the safety of Larisa Gorbuntsov (right) who flew to her husband's bedside in London. At one point, the Russian authorities. regarded Mr Gorbuntsov as a possible suspect because of an alleged. 106million debt owed by Mr Antonov to Gorbuntsov. Yesterday, 61-year-old Mr Antonov claimed that he and Mr Gorbuntsov had 'normal' and even 'friendly' relations. 'He was not a part of the. assassination attempt. He had some information about how it was. prepared, and wanted to pass it on, that's it,' he said. Asked why Mr Gorbuntsov had been. targeted, he said: 'Perhaps because the people who did it were very. scared of this information getting publicly known, specially given that,. as I understood, German was adamant in his decision to make it public. 'So they went as far in the centre of. the legal world - I consider London to be the capital of the legal world. - in prime time, to carry out this slaughter.' He stressed: 'My personal attitude to. it is that it simply beggars belief, it beggars belief. How can you sort. business issues by such methods? It is terrorism. It is simply. terrorism. Shooting: German Gorbuntsov, 45, was attacked on the Isle of Dogs close to Canary Wharf. 'But I think the fact that it happened. in London does give hope to believe that Russian and British law. enforcement systems would together discover who did it, and get the. b******s.' Asked if he agreed that the two men. named by Mr Gorbuntsov to Russian prosecutors - Pyotr Chuvilin and Sergei. Mendeleyev - as being behind the Mr Antonov assassination attempt, were. indeed involved. 'I'm scared to give the positive. answer to that, is it up to the investigation and the court to establish. it. But they can be somewhere there. Nearby. ' Asked if Russians were behind the crime, he said: 'I agree.' Asked whether he would now feel safe coming to London, he said: 'Well, what do you do? You've got to keep living. ' Gun blast: German Gorbuntsov is pictured here being carried into ambulance after being shot in Canary Wharf. Gorbuntsov's testimony appeared to give the missing link in establishing who ordered the attack against Antonov. Gorbuntsov's lawyer Vadim Vedenin has. admitted in the Mr Antonov case that his client was initially 'suspected in. organising this attempt on his life', because he was present at the. meeting where property claims to the Antonov family were talked about. and where the Antonovs were threatened. 'This is true, he was present there,. we do not deny it. But still he is not in anyway related to the attempt. on his life itself.' Alexander Antonov, father of former Portsmouth FC owner Vladimir Antonov, lost the use of an arm after a 2009 assassination bid in Moscow. Three Chechen men were convicted of attempted murder and sent to prison on long sentences a year later, but police never identified the mastermind. The same gang was convicted of killing Ruslan Yamadayev, rivals to hardman Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Kremlin-backed president. Ex-Russian MP Yamadayev was gunned down in his car close to the British Embassy in Moscow in September 2008. His brother Sulim, a Kadyrov enemy, was shot dead in Dubai in March 2009 by men using a gold-plated pistol. In November 2006 Russian dissident Alexander. Litvinenko (pictured above) was murdered in London. British. prosecutors have named his fellow ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoy as the. main suspect in his poisoning with radioactive polonium-210. However, the Russian authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the UK.' The lawyer stressed: 'He clearly said he had nothing to do with the attempt on Antonov's life.' It has also emerged Mr Gorbuntsov was preparing to claim political asylum in Britain for himself and his family. The financier's business visa, which had allowed him to live here legally since 2008, expires next year. It is thought the 45-year-old feared he would be forced to return to Russia and into the clutches of his many enemies. He said recently: ‘If I go back to. Russia, they will kill me.’ Last night Mr Gorbuntsov was under armed. guard in hospital after being hit up to six times. With. the would-be assassin still on the loose there were fears for the. safety of Mr Gorbuntsov’s wife Larisa, 46, and son. Mrs Gorbuntsov flew. to London to be at her husband’s bedside while their 25-year-old son. Vladislav is seeking a visa to come to Britain. Scotland. Yard yesterday appealed for a taxi driver who may have witnessed the. shooting to come forward. Mr Gorbuntsov was shot after being dropped off. by taxi at his apartment block next to Canary Wharf on Tuesday evening. The. banker, who had been at a business meeting in Bishopsgate in the City. earlier that evening, hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm. He had just. stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets. The. hooded gunman, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fled on foot. A. young blonde woman, reported to be Mr Gorbuntsov’s mistress and the. mother of his second child, was at his side as emergency services. arrived. Mr Gorbuntsov's lawyer also said the banker had been planning to submit a. political asylum request to stay within days. A successful asylum claim. would have helped him fight off attempts by Moldova to extradite him on. allegations of embezzlement. There. was also an apparent financial wrangle with state-controlled Russian Railways,. whose president is an ally of Vladimir Putin. An estimated £415million. was allegedly not repaid after being deposited by the business into a Moscow bank. whose ownership later passed to Mr Gorbuntsov and his associates.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : My girlfriend left my place moments ago to get space. I think she left feeling hurt that I ruined what she wanted to do and me feeling that she ruined what we had planned with a surprise which could have been pleasant if it had been done differently. Am I the asshole here? **Backstory:** I'm 26 and she is 36. We've been dating for a few months now. There have been a few times where I felt she was unreliable with plans already made or things she said and didn't follow through with. There have been a few occasions where she wasn't ready at the time we had planned on. There have been a few occasions where she said she would call/message in a while and didn't. Or she would stop over when something was done and didn't. Or changed her mind altogether. My previous relationship ended with me breaking up with my ex because she continuously blew me off last minute for other things. One time we were planning to see a movie and she said she would rather hang out with some friends. I wasn't invited and later came to find out they had gone to the movies. This hurt me deeply and to lookout for myself I called it quits with that relationship. It had become a pattern. I shared this with my current girlfriend and on the occasions I mentioned above rather than bottle things up I let her know that it bothered me so she wasn't new to how much being reliable meant to me. I said it along the lines of I don't think there are a lot of things which bother me much but this is a sore spot and something that ended my previous relationship and with it bothering me could she please be considerate of that. **Which leads us to tonight:** I had spent the night at her place and before leaving to do some stuff I put out there that maybe we could do something later. She knows I've been wanting to go see a movie together for a while. As I was finishing up at the gym at about 9pm I asked if she would like to see a movie. The conversation went like this: Me: I could go for some chicken tenders and an ice cream cookies sandwich. What about you? (the theater has food) Her: What time Me: Would you like to pick? I know I'd like the tenders ice cream and you. Not too worried about which movie or time. Her: Sure let me look :) Her: Okay I picked that happy death day 2 at 10:30pm is that okay Me: Yes, done. Me: I'm home now going to have a protein shake. I'll be back over in time for the movie. Her: Is there anything you want me to bring Me: Not that I can think of. When I was leaving the house I told her I was on my way and she said no don't go she is on her way. At that point I was in the car just down the street but no big deal I went back home. She gets over and comes in, sits down for a few minutes and I play some music. We were timing the movie to get there missing most of the previews. I was very much looking forward to and planning on being warm with a blanket at the theater and getting food there because I was hungry. As I was putting my coat on for us to go out the door she tells me wait. That I have encouraged her to speak her mind and go with what she is feeling. I asked what's up. She said she doesn't really want to go to the movie now and would rather do something else. She isn't sure what but will I come along for a surprise night. She mentioned going to a graveyard or some railroad tracks or out to a bar to get a drink and shoot pool. I told her that yes she is most certainly free to speak her mind but those things didn't interest me at the moment, my heart was set on getting food and being cuddled up watching a movie. I said I didn't want to be outside in the cold (New York) and we had gone out to a bar on Friday already. She asked why I couldn't be more open minded to surprises. I responded that I'm okay with surprises but I didn't like how last minute this was after we already had plans and were almost out the door. I told her I believe that had she instead suggested a surprise night earlier such as at 9pm when I first asked about seeing a movie, I would have been receptive to it. I followed up with, can we still go see the movie tonight and do a surprise something another time? She said no, she isn't going to see the movie now but I am welcome to still go myself. I said okay you can go do what you want and I'll go see the movie and I don't like that we ended up in this situation. There was some more back and forth at which point I likely would have missed the beginning of the movie so I changed to I would stay home and find something to eat. **Change of plans:** Let me admit I was upset now and took a snarky tone. She wanted me to go along with her for the ride and see what happened. I asked if we could still take care of me getting something to eat and not be in the cold. So there I am and we're in the car. She stops for gas and we're talking. I brought up again that reliability is very important to me and that I felt this was her being unreliable and reminded her that it had ended a relationship before. I'm not sure how rough it came across to her. I didn't mean it as a threat, rather I was distressed and urgently trying to convey how important this was to me so that it would be taken seriously. She said she would just take me home. I said here I am already with you, I can stay quiet if you like, let's just do what you want to do and make the best of things. She took us to Walmart where she proceeded to wander around and get nothing. As we talked while walking around she divulged that she had wanted to go to her father's grave but I had ruined that for her and she was no longer in the mood for it. I said I wish she had said so sooner, that I thought that would be a sweet thing to do and that I was up for doing that. She lost her father about a year ago which I am sympathetic to. I went on to say I would be honored to go with her and that I recognize the significance of her inviting me there. She reiterated that it was already ruined for her at the moment. I asked how long she had known this was what she wanted to do. She said it hadn't occurred to her that it was what she wanted to do until when we were leaving the gas station. At that point I wasn't happy but was talking about salvaging the night doing something and said of all things I didn't want to just walk around Walmart. So we left and she said she would drop me off at home. I said we could watch a movie at my place, still go to the graveyard, go out for a drink, do something to end the night on a better note. She could come in or we could go to her place. Reluctantly she came in but just started cleaning stuff. We weren't doing anything together. She said I could start doing what I wanted and I said what I wanted was to do something together. She said I told you in the car I didn't want to do anything together right now and want space. She got her coat and left.  So from planning to see a movie and have food to being here writing this.

Augusta Jane Evans, or Augusta Evans Wilson (May 8, 1835 - May 9, 1909), was an American author of Southern literature. She was the first woman to earn US100,000 through her writing. Wilson was a native of Columbus, Georgia, and her first book, Inez, a Tale of the Alamo, was written when she was still young. Augusta Evans Wilson was not a professional writer and her style was severely criticized as \\"pedantic.\\" She wrote in the domestic, sentimental style of the Victorian Age. Critics have praised the intellectual competence of her female characters, but as her heroes eventually succumb to traditional values, Wilson has been described as an antifeminist. Of St. Elmo one critic maintained, \\"the trouble with the heroine of St. Elmo was that she swallowed an unabridged dictionary.\\" Wilson was the first American woman author to earn over 100,000. This would be a record unsurpassed until Edith Wharton.  Macaria, or Altars of Sacrifice, published in 1864, was popular with Southerners and Northerners alike. Melissa Homestead writes that the transportation of the novel to New York was deliberate, done in installments and nearly simultaneous with the novel's preparation for publication in the South. Thus, while previous critics, scholars and biographers have all treated Macaria's appearance in the North as unauthorized, the truth is much more meaningful. Some scholars say that by dispensing with the romantic notion that the novel appeared in a \\"bootleg\\" edition, Homestead debunks the hard and fast distinction between Northern and Southern readerships as an invention of historians and critics rather than an accurate reflection of reading practices of the period. However, a great number of discrepancies exist between the version published in the North and the version published in the South, which remove huge portions of the text which romanticize the Southern heroes that are portrayed.  Her novel St. Elmo was her most famous and it was frequently adapted for both the stage and screen. It inspired the naming of towns, hotels, steamboats, and a cigar brand. The book's heroine, Edna Earl, became the namesake of Eudora Welty's heroine (Edna Earle Ponder) in The Ponder Heart published in 1954. The novel also inspired a parody of itself called St. Twel'mo, or the Cuneiform Cyclopedist of Chattanooga (1867) by Charles Henry Webb.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -9*v - 16*v = -100 for v, you should follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. In this equation, both terms on the left side of the equation, -9v and -16v, are like terms since both have the same variable, v. -9v - 16v = (-9 - 16)v When you add -9 and -16, you get: -25v So the equation becomes: -25v = -100 Step 2: Isolate the variable (v). To do this, you need to divide both sides of the equation by -25. (-25v) / (-25) = (-100) / (-25) v = 4 Step 3: Check your answer. Substitute the value of v back into the original equation to see if it is correct: -9*v - 16*v = -100 -9*(4) - 16*(4) -36 - 64 = -100 Both sides of the equation are equal, so the solution is correct. Therefore, v = 4 is the solution to the equation -9*v - 16*v = -100."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"A pay order and a cheque are both ways to transfer money from one person to another.  A pay order is like a special note that promises to pay a specific amount of money to the person whose name is on it. It's issued by a bank and is very safe, because only the named person can get the money. A cheque is like a written instruction that tells your bank to pay a certain amount of money to someone else's bank account. You write the amount, the name of the person, and sign it. It's also a safe way to transfer money, but not as secure as a pay order. Regarding CreateSpace, I am sorry to tell you that CreateSpace has been discontinued, and it was replaced by Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP).

Do the above sentences mean the same thing?","output":"No, the above sentences do not mean the same thing. They are related but convey different aspects of Kathy Nicolo's character and situation. The first sentence highlights the significance of the house in Kathy Nicolo's (Jennifer Connelly) life. For her, the house represents stability and family, which are essential components of her emotional, personal, and psychological well-being. This sentence underscores the importance of the connection between the physical space of the house and Kathy's emotional connection to it. It shows that owning and maintaining the house is crucial for her sense of belonging and security within her family and her life in general. The second sentence, on the other hand, delves more into Kathy's personal situation and her internal struggle. It suggests that Kathy is going through tough times, and her life has spiraled out of control. However, she is reluctant to let her family know about her situation, and desperately tries to prevent them from finding out. This sentence highlights her desire to maintain an appearance of normalcy and stability for her family. It also sheds light on the emotional burden she carries, as she grapples with the fear of being exposed and the need to safeguard her family's image within the community and her own self-esteem. In summary, the first sentence emphasizes the importance of the house as a symbol of stability and family for Kathy Nicolo, whereas the second sentence deals with the emotional complexity of her life as she hides the truth about her messy situation from her family. While both sentences revolve around the theme of family and stability, they provide different perspectives on Kathy's experience, making them distinct, yet related, concepts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After earning success in the Western TV series \\"Rawhide\\", he rose to international fame with his role as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's \\"Dollars\\" trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five \\"Dirty Harry\\" films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.  - Rhodesia, commonly known from 1970 onwards as the Republic of Rhodesia, was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territorial terms to modern Zimbabwe. With its capital in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia was considered a \\"de facto\\" successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia (which had achieved responsible government in 1923).  - Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western (primarily in Japan), is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success. The term was used by American critics and other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.  - The Man with No Name is the protagonist portrayed by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's \\"Dollars Trilogy\\" of Spaghetti Western films: \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" (1964), \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" (1965) and \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" (1966). He is easily recognizable due to his iconic brown hat, green poncho, tan cowboy boots, fondness for cigarillos and the fact that he rarely talks. Since he never received a name in any of the films, he is conventionally known as \\"the man with no name\\". When Clint Eastwood was honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996 Jim Carrey held the introductory speech and said: \\"'The Man With No Name' had no name, so we could fill in our own.\\" In 2008, \\"Empire\\" chose the Man With No Name as the 33rd greatest movie character of all time.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth.  and the situation: Robert, a baker, has just baked a large batch of cupcakes for his store. He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.  Answer the following question: Which temperature will result in faster decay of the cupcakes? Answer:","output":"Given the background information on freezing as a method of food preservation and the situation presented about Robert and his cupcakes, we can analyze the impact of the two temperature options (0° F and 10° F) on the rate of decay of the cupcakes. Freezing is effective in preserving food because both the reduction in temperature and the decreased availability of water for bacterial growth slow down the process of food decay. Lower temperatures cause a reduction in the reaction rates of chemical and enzymatic processes in food, which in turn slows down deterioration and the growth of micro-organisms. Additionally, when water freezes, it becomes less available for bacterial growth, further enhancing preservation. In Robert's situation, he wants to preserve a portion of the cupcakes for later by storing them in the freezer. When comparing the two temperature options, 0° F would be the better choice for the following reasons: 1. Lower temperatures slow down reaction rates: At 0° F, reactions, both chemical and enzymatic, will occur at a slower pace compared to those at 10° F. This is because lower temperatures decrease the kinetic energy and molecular movement, resulting in fewer effective collisions between reacting molecules. Therefore, a temperature of 0° F would slow down decomposition more effectively than 10° F. 2. Reduced bacterial growth: Bacteria and other micro-organisms are the main agents of food spoilage. The lower the temperature, the slower their growth. At 0° F, the metabolic activities of bacteria would be even more suppressed than at 10° F, which means that bacterial growth and reproduction would be slower at the lower temperature. Consequently, preserving the cupcakes at 0° F would result in a longer shelf life. 3. Less water available for bacterial growth: One of the key aspects of the freezing process is making water less available for bacterial growth. At 0° F, more water content in the cupcakes will be frozen, binding the liquid and minimizing its availability for bacterial activity. Conversely, at 10° F, slightly more water may be available for these organisms, increasing the potential for spoilage. In conclusion, if Robert stores his cupcakes at 0° F, the rate of decay will be slower than at 10° F due to the more pronounced reduction in molecular motion and reaction rates, further inhibition of bacterial growth, and decreased water availability for micro-organisms. Thus, 0° F is the better choice for preserving the cupcakes and maintaining their quality for later consumption."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

In this statement, the loan terms are being described. It is explained that the loan has a repayment period of 20 years in total, meaning the borrower has this amount of time to repay the loan fully. Additionally, there is a 5-year grace period, which signifies that during the initial five years of the loan term, the borrower does not have to make any payments towards the loan principal or interest.  This type of loan is often sought by borrowers who have an expectation of increased income or financial stability in the future or for those looking for flexibility in the early stages of the loan repayment process. This grace period allows them to focus their resources on other financial commitments. However, it is crucial for borrowers to understand that during the grace period, typically only interest keeps accruing on the loan and is capitalized into the outstanding loan amount. Consequently, when the grace period ends, they may find themselves faced with a higher loan balance and increased monthly payments.  Banks and financial institutions offering such loans usually evaluate the applicant's financial situation, income, and their ability to repay the loan once the grace period ends. Ensuring responsible lending practices and preventing a financial burden on the borrowers are important aspects that lenders must consider while approving these types of loans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom then moved to more technical potential issues with the printer, suggesting that something might be wrong with her personal computer, which sometimes may be the problem if drivers or printer settings are not correctly installed or set up. But before Tom could help her check on that, Jenny realized that she hadn't turned on her Wi-Fi.  Many printers nowadays operate through Wi-Fi connectivity for receiving print commands, therefore, if Wi-Fi isn't enabled, the computer wouldn't be able to communicate with the printer to issue a print command. Once Jenny realized this, she acknowledges that, with Tom’s support, she could solve her own problem.  Tom concluded that session on a happy note, expressing his pleasure at being able to assist. He playfully referred to Jenny as \\"sister\\", which could indicate a close friendly relationship between the two. In summary, the conversation was about troubleshooting a printer, with the issue being resolved by the user recognizing that her Wi-Fi connection was turned off."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: Islamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam—i.e., the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al-Farabi (Abunaser), İbn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), sultan, ummah, cemaa (obligation)-and even the \\"core\\" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., ibadah (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and ilah (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What determines the amount of daylight earth gets? \\" with the following options:  - Heat energy  - The darkness it gets  - The bending of a ray of light  - The tilt of the axis  - The tilt of the sun's axis  - electromagnetic energy  - The brightness of the earth  - rain or sun shine A:","output":"To answer the question \\"What determines the amount of daylight earth gets?\\", let's go through the options step by step and evaluate them: 1. Heat energy: While heat energy comes from the sun, it is not the primary factor that determines the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct. 2. The darkness it gets: This option is a result of the lack of daylight, not a determining factor. So, this option is not correct. 3. The bending of a ray of light: While the bending of light can cause some changes in how we perceive daylight, it's not the main factor that determines the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct. 4. The tilt of the axis: Given Fact 2, the tilt of Earth's axis is responsible for causing seasons, which in turn influences the amount of daylight Earth gets (as seen in Fact 1). This option aligns with the given facts and is therefore the correct answer. 5. The tilt of the sun's axis: The tilt of the sun's axis does not directly affect the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct. 6. Electromagnetic energy: While sunlight is a type of electromagnetic energy, it's not the main factor determining the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct. 7. The brightness of the earth: The brightness of the Earth does not directly influence the amount of daylight we get. So, this option is not correct. 8. Rain or sunshine: While rain and sunshine are related to weather, they do not directly determine the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct. Based on the given facts and our evaluation of the options, the correct answer to the question \\"What determines the amount of daylight earth gets?\\" is \\"The tilt of the axis.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: New Orleans narcotics detective Anthony Stowe is a heroin addict who is teetering on the edge of oblivion, and he could not care less. At the moment, he is trying to bring down his former partner Gabriel Callahan, who has become a drug kingpin. Callahan is trying to, and slowly succeeding at, taking over the New Orleans underworld. Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson, whose fiancée, fellow cop Van Huffel, nearly comes to blows with him over it. Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe, who is dismissive. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge; he instead turns Curry over to Baylor, who fires him. After barricading himself in the station bathroom, Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers. That night Stowe meets with his estranged wife, Valerie, who tells him that she's pregnant, but that he's not the father. Valerie, whose marriage with Stowe is close to collapse, has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini, the gym teacher at the school she is principal of. But he may not be the father either. Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan, and she tells him she never wants to see him again. The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan. But he drunkenly stumbles into an ambush masterminded by Callahan, and is shot in the head by Callahan's right-hand man Jimmy. Stowe undergoes emergency surgery, and ends up in a coma. Months later, he recovers to the point that he opens his eyes, and is transported to his and Valerie's house to recover properly. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the man that shot Anthony Stowe?, what is it ?

Information:  - The Low Countries is a coastal region in western Europe, consisting especially of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the low-lying delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and Ems rivers where much of the land is at or below sea level. This wide area of Western Europe roughly stretches from French Gravelines and Dunkirk at its southwestern point, to the area of Dutch Delfzijl and German Eastern Frisia at its northeastern point, and to Luxembourg and French Thionville in the southeast.  - Fijnaart en Heijningen is a former municipality in the Dutch province of North Brabant . It covered the villages of Fijnaart and Heijningen . Fijnaart en Heijningen was a separate municipality until 1997 , when it was merged with Zevenbergen .  - Zevenbergen is a Dutch city which is a part of the municipality of Moerdijk. Zevenbergen is located in the northwest of the province of Noord-Brabant near Breda.  - A strait is a naturally formed, narrow, typically navigable waterway that connects two larger bodies of water. Most commonly it is a channel of water that lies between two land masses. Some straits are not navigable, for example because they are too shallow, or because of an unnavigable reef or archipelago.  - A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.  - Zeeland (Zeelandic: \\"Zeêland\\" ) is the westernmost province of the Netherlands. The province, located in the south-west of the country, consists of a number of islands and peninsulas (hence its name, meaning \\"sea-land\\") and a strip bordering Belgium. Its capital is Middelburg. Its area is about , of which almost is water, and it has a population of about 380,000.  - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse (Maas) river westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the RhineMeuseScheldt delta. History. The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands.  Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794.  - Fijnaart is a town in the Dutch province of North Brabant. It is located in the municipality of Moerdijk, about 8 km west of the town of Zevenbergen.  - The Meuse (Walloon: \\"Mouze\\" ) or Maas is a major European river, rising in France and flowing through Belgium and the Netherlands before draining into the North Sea. It has a total length of .  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - The Dutch Republic, also known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands ('), Republic of the United Netherlands or Republic of the Seven United Provinces ('), was a republic in Europe existing from 1581, when part of the Netherlands separated from Spanish rule, until 1795. It preceded the Batavian Republic, the Kingdom of Holland, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and ultimately the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands. Alternative names include the United Provinces ('), Seven Provinces ('), Federated Dutch Provinces ('), and Dutch Federation (').  - The Generality Lands, Lands of the Generality or Common Lands were about one fifth of the territories of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, that were directly governed by the States-General. Unlike the seven provinces Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel, Friesland and Groningen, these territories had no States-Provincial and were not represented in the central government.  - Moerdijk is a municipality and a town in the South of the Netherlands, in the province of North Brabant.  - South Holland is a province in the midwestern Netherlands. It has a population of just over 3.6 million (as of 2015) and a population density of about , making it the country's most populous province and one of the world's most densely populated areas. Situated on the North Sea in the west of the Netherlands, South Holland covers an area of , of which is water. It borders North Holland to the north, Utrecht and Gelderland to the east, and North Brabant and Zeeland to the south. The provincial capital is The Hague, while its largest city is Rotterdam.  - Hollands Diep (pre-1947 spelling: Hollandsch Diep) is a wide river in the Netherlands and an estuary of the Rhine and Meuse river. Through the Scheldt-Rhine Canal it connects to the Scheldt river and Antwerp.  - Gelderland (also Guelders in English) is a province of the Netherlands, located in the central eastern part of the country. With a land area of nearly 5,000 km, it is the largest province of the Netherlands and shares borders with six other provinces and Germany.   - The Duchy of Brabant was a State of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was partitioned after the Dutch revolt.  - The Peace of Westphalia was a series of peace treaties signed between May and October 1648 in the Westphalian cities of Osnabrück and Münster, effectively ending the European wars of religion.  These treaties ended the Thirty Years' War (16181648) in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Eighty Years' War (15681648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic, with Spain formally recognizing the independence of the Dutch Republic.  - The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories.  - Holland is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. The name \\"Holland\\" is also frequently used to informally refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and not entirely uncommon among the Dutch themselves, though some in the Netherlands and particularly in other regions of the country may find it undesirable, misleading or insulting.  - The RhineMeuseScheldt delta or Helinium is a river delta in the Netherlands formed by the confluence of the Rhine, the Meuse and the Scheldt rivers. The result is a multitude of islands, branches and branch names that may at first sight look bewildering, especially as a waterway that appears to be one continuous stream may change names as many as seven times, e.g. Rhine  Bijlands Kanaal  Pannerdens Kanaal  Nederrijn  Lek  Nieuwe Maas  Het Scheur  Nieuwe Waterweg ( North Sea). Since the Rhine contributes most of the water, the shorter term \\"Rhine Delta\\" is commonly used. However, this name is also used for the river delta where the Rhine flows into Lake Constance, so it is clearer to call the larger one Rhine-Meuse delta, or even \\"Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt Delta\\", as the Scheldt ends in the same delta.

Sentence 1: oh really just easy to get them there and stuff Sentence 2: It's easy to get them there. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze the structure and meaning of both sentences step by step. Sentence 1: \\"oh really just easy to get them there and stuff\\" - This sentence seems informal and might be part of a casual conversation. - The main message of this sentence is that it's easy to get \\"them\\" to a certain location. Sentence 2: \\"It's easy to get them there.\\" - This sentence is more formal and clear. - The meaning is similar to the first sentence: it's easy to get \\"them\\" to a certain location. Now let's determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence: 1. Identify the main points of both sentences.   - Both sentences emphasize that it's easy to get \\"them\\" to a certain location. 2. Compare the main points.   - The main points of both sentences are essentially the same. 3. Determine if the second sentence is a direct or indirect consequence of the first sentence.   - The second sentence rephrases the main message of the first sentence, making it clearer and more formal.

Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) receives a message from Captain Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) of the Logos calling an emergency meeting of all of Zion's ships. Zion has confirmed the last transmission of the Osiris: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. Commander Lock (Harry Lennix) orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain in order to contact the Oracle (Gloria Foster). The Caduceus receives a message from the Oracle, and the Nebuchadnezzar ventures out so Neo can contact her. One of the Caduceus crew, Bane (Ian Bliss), encounters Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who takes over Bane's avatar. Smith then uses this avatar to leave the Matrix, gaining control of Bane's real body. In Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. Neo receives a message from the Oracle and returns to the Matrix to meet her bodyguard Seraph (Collin Chou), who then leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that it is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix by finding the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim), a prisoner of the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted, and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo as a host, but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.

By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers. Both physical and relational aggression are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties, especially depression, as is social rejection. Because of this, bullied adolescents often develop problems that lead to further victimization. Bullied adolescents are both more likely to continued to be bullied and to bully others in the future. However, this relationship is less stable in cases of cyberbullying, a relatively new issue among adolescents. What is the answer to this question: What are some of the negative experiences that peer pressure can influence during adolescence?","output":"Peer pressure can sometimes make kids do things that are not good or safe. Some negative experiences caused by peer pressure during teenage years can include trying drugs, drinking alcohol, doing naughty things like vandalism or stealing, and even being mean or aggressive towards others. These situations can make teenagers feel sad or upset and face difficulties in their life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- As royalty from different parts of the world converged on the Netherlands to watch the monarchy change hands, some of the guests there may have been thinking ahead to the day when they get the top job back home. In Europe, most monarchs are getting old and have been on their thrones for years. Their offspring are grown up and are now waiting in the wings to take their respective crowns. Britain's Prince Charles was in Amsterdam to watch Queen Beatrix hand over to her 46-year-old son Willem-Alexander. He was also in the Netherlands when Beatrix herself took the throne from her mother 33 years ago on Queen Juliana's abdication. Charles's new Dutch counterpart is Amalia, The Princess of Orange, who is nine. However, in an age when the pope resigns, don't be surprised if other older royals take some sort of cue from","output":"the Vatican and consider abdication as a viable option for themselves, paving the way for a younger generation of royals to ascend to the throne. The succession of the monarchy in various European countries has long been determined by the natural progression of aging and eventual passing of the reigning monarch. Still, in recent times, there seems to be a growing consensus supporting the idea of an orderly transfer of power before any significant decline in health or capability occurs. The abdication of Queen Beatrix, for example, has been taken as a significant and refreshing move by many in the region. It not only allowed her to retire gracefully while still in good health but also set a precedent for other aging European monarchs to deliberate on the possibility of voluntary renunciation in favor of paving the way for a new generation. One potential factor for consideration is the change in the public's expectations and perceptions of their royal families. In the modern age, people are less inclined to view these figures as untouchable divine rulers and more as public servants whose primary role is to represent their countries on the world stage, promote national unity, and preserve their cultural heritage. Given this shift in perspective, it would be logical for aging monarchs to evaluate their ability to carry out these responsibilities effectively, especially in the face of increasing demand for transparency, accountability, and the widespread reach of social media. By making the choice to step down voluntarily, older royals can demonstrate both humility and a genuine concern for the best interests of their nations and their subjects. Moreover, the rise of democratic values across the globe has led to questions about the role and relevance of traditional monarchies in today's world. By choosing to abdicate in favor of a younger successor, older monarchs can make way for a fresh set of ideas, perspectives, and approaches to governance that resonate with the changing times, while also appeasing calls for the modernization and transformation of their institutions. With these factors in mind, it would not be surprising to see a growing trend of abdications among the royal families of Europe and beyond. By doing so, these aging rulers can ensure a smoother transition of power, increased public goodwill, and the continued relevance of their monarchies in an ever-evolving world. In conclusion, the voluntary abdication of older European monarchs, taking inspiration from recent events like Queen Beatrix's abdication and the pope's resignation, maybe a logical, compassionate, and strategic move that ushers in a new era of modernized and adaptable leadership. It also signifies an acceptance of the changing world and the desire to remain connected to the public they serve while recognizing the importance of the monarchy's enduring values and traditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Article: Spiderman is one of the most famous comic book heroes of all time. He was created by Stan Lee in 1963 and was first introduced to the world in the pages of Marvel Comic Books. Spiderman's story is the story of Peter Parker, a child who lost his parents and lives with his aunt and uncle. Peter is a shy, quiet boy wearing glasses and has few friends. One day, on a high school class trip to a science lab, he gets bitten by a special spider. Soon Peter realizes he has amazing powers: he is as strong and quick as a spider and also has a type of sixth sense. He no longer needs his glasses and he can use his super power to fly through the city streets! Remembering something his Uncle Ben has told him _ ,Peter decides to use his powers to fight against enemies who do cruel things to people. And so, Spiderman is born. Life is not easy for Peter even though he is a superhero. He is in love with Mary Jane but he can't tell her about his amazing powers. Besides, his best friend Harry hates Spiderman! Peter is also short of money and time. He has to sell photos of Spiderman (himself!) to a newspaper and he keeps losing his other jobs because he's so busy saving people! Yet he has to fight against different kinds of cruel enemies. Question: What does\\"With great power, there must also come great responsibility\\"mean?

Here is the justification for each step: 1. You take a tray: Drinking large quantities of water does not impact the availability or acquisition of an ice cube tray. 2. Add water into the tray: Drinking more water may lead to using more water, which could affect the amount of water available to fill the tray. This is an indirect impact since the person's water consumption does not directly change the action of pouring water into the tray. 3. You insert the tray into a freezer: Drinking water does not impact the action of inserting the tray into a freezer. 4. The water molecules begin to slow down: The consumption of water does not impact the physical process of water molecules slowing down when exposed to low temperatures. 5. The water becomes ice: The transformation of water into ice is not affected by the person's water consumption. 6. The ice cubes are ready: Once the water becomes ice, the person's water consumption does not affect the readiness of the ice cubes for use.

Miyagi confronts Kreese and passively immobilizes him. Miyagi threatens to strike a deadly blow but instead comically tweaks Kreese's nose and walks away. Six months later, Miyagi receives a letter notifying him that his father is dying. He plans to return to his home village in Okinawa, and Daniel accompanies him. Miyagi tells Daniel about why he left Okinawa many years ago. He fell in love with a woman named Yukie, who was arranged to marry his best friend Sato, son of the richest man in the village and fellow karate student of his father. Upon announcing his intentions to marry Yukie, Sato challenged him to a fight to the death. Rather than fight, however, Miyagi left the country. In Okinawa, Miyagi and Daniel are greeted by Chozen Toguchi, who drives Miyagi and Daniel to one of Sato's warehouses, where he reveals he's Sato's nephew. Sato appears and demands to fight Miyagi, who adamantly refuses. Arriving at the village, Miyagi and Daniel are welcomed by Yukie and her niece Kumiko. They discover that Sato has become a rich industrialist whose supertrawlers have destroyed the local fish population impoverishing the other villagers.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read this: Bacteria, as asexual organisms, inherit identical copies of their parent's genes (i.e., they are clonal). However, all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material DNA caused by genetic recombination or mutations. Mutations come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to mutagens. Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria. Genetic changes in bacterial genomes come from either random mutation during replication or \\"stress-directed mutation\\", where genes involved in a particular growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What can cause mutation in bacteria?","output":"Mutations in bacteria can be caused by two main factors: 1. Errors during DNA replication: As bacteria reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission, they need to replicate their DNA to pass it on to their offspring. During this replication process, errors may occur, leading to changes in their genetic material. These errors can be caused by mispairing of nucleotides, insertion or deletion of bases, or mistakes made by DNA polymerase enzymes. Such errors introduce variations in the bacterial genetic material and can cause mutations. 2. Exposure to mutagens: Mutagens are external factors that can cause changes in the DNA of bacteria. These may be physical mutagens, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, X-rays, or gamma rays, which can induce changes in the DNA structure, such as double-strand breaks or cross-linking of bases. Additionally, mutagens may also be chemical agents like reactive oxygen species, alkylating agents, or base analogs that can alter the structure or function of nucleotides in bacterial DNA and result in mutations. In some cases, bacteria may encounter stress-directed mutations, which is when genes involved in a specific growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate. In summary, mutations in bacteria can be caused by errors during DNA replication or exposure to mutagens, such as radiation or chemicals. These genetic changes form the basis for bacterial evolution and adaptation to new environments or conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. – Attorney General Jeff Sessions was interviewed for hours last week in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, the Justice Department confirmed Tuesday. The interview comes as Mueller is investigating whether President Trump's actions in office, including the firing of FBI Director James Comey, constituted obstruction of justice. Mueller is also investigating contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. Sessions is thought to be the highest-ranking Trump administration official to be interviewed by Mueller's team—the New York Times calls the interview the first to touch Trump's Cabinet—and is seen as a potentially important witness given that Trump initially said he fired Comey last May at the recommendation of the Justice Department, reports the AP. At the time, the White House released a memo from Sessions' deputy, Rod Rosenstein, faulting Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and appearing to lay the groundwork for his dismissal. Trump has since said he was thinking of \\"the Russia thing\\" when he fired Comey. The Times was the first to report news of the interview, and the paper notes that in recusing himself from the Russia investigation, Sessions was left with \\"no control of Mr. Mueller.\\" CNN reports the interview took place last Wednesday and notes Sessions had not been subpoenaed. It adds that press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed Sessions was at the White House Monday, but she said she was unaware whether he and Trump spoke of the interview.

Jeff Sessions is kind of like a hall monitor from your school. His official title is Attorney General, which means he helps to enforce the law or the rules of the country. Now, there's this man named Robert Mueller, who's kind of like a detective. He's trying to figure out if the big boss of the country, President Trump, and his friends did anything wrong with another country called Russia during the time they were trying to become the leaders of the country. This is like when you play a game, and someone may have cheated to win. Mr. Mueller is trying to find out if this happened with president Trump and Russia. Last week, Mueller wanted to ask Jeff Sessions some questions to help his investigation. He spent a lot of time talking, like when your teacher asks you about what you did during the weekend. Everyone thinks this is important because Sessions is one of the biggest boss men in Trump's group. It's kind of like when the principal is asked about something that happened in your school.  Now, remember the time you told me about Johnny taking your toy but then he said you gave it to him? And then the teacher had to find out what really happened: that's what Robert Mueller is doing right now with President Trump and his friends.

An autopsy is an examination of the body of a deceased person, carried out by a qualified pathologist. The pathologist creates a written record of the autopsy findings, including the microscopic and laboratory tests. OPTIONS:  -- Its purpose is to determine whether or not medical testing would be performed on the deceased. The entire procedure is non-medical, and may not be performed on someone having been autoimmune prior to the autopsy.;  -- Next of kin or other authorized individuals can then request copies of these reports. There are two types of autopsies : The hospital autopsy: this type is often referred to as a post-mortem exam or necropsy.;  -- Autopsy reports are tailored for funeral homes and are meant to provide background information and concrete examples of the autopsy itself. They generally include detailed medical and statistical evidence about the death.;  -- The specimen is then analyzed, and the pathologist examines it to assess its quality. An autopsy is in essence a learning experience.; The answer is:","output":"Next of kin or other authorized individuals can then request copies of these reports. There are two types of autopsies: The hospital autopsy: this type is often referred to as a post-mortem exam or necropsy. Explanation: This option is correct because it explains that authorized people can request copies of autopsy reports and also mentions the two types of autopsies. Now let's look at the other options and explain why they are wrong: 1. Its purpose is to determine whether or not medical testing would be performed on the deceased. The entire procedure is non-medical, and may not be performed on someone having been autoimmune prior to the autopsy. - This option is incorrect because an autopsy is a medical procedure performed by a pathologist to examine the deceased person. 2. Autopsy reports are tailored for funeral homes and are meant to provide background information and concrete examples of the autopsy itself. They generally include detailed medical and statistical evidence about the death. - This option is incorrect because autopsy reports are not tailored for funeral homes. They are official documents that can be requested by the next of kin or other authorized individuals, and they include important medical information about the deceased person. 3. The specimen is then analyzed, and the pathologist examines it to assess its quality. An autopsy is in essence a learning experience. - This option is incorrect because even though an autopsy can provide valuable information for learning, its main purpose is to determine the cause of death and provide a comprehensive examination of the deceased person.

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.  Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Some children cannot wait to grow up. Because once you become an adult, you are free to make your own decisions. More importantly, you can do all those things that you cannot do now because you are too young. So, the question is, 'At what age do you really become an adult?' Well, people become adults at different ages in different places. In Australia, the 18th birthday is a very important event for young Australians because it means they can do almost anything they want. They can vote, learn to drive a car, get married, join the army and even buy their own houses. However, even if they can do all these things, most Australians have to wait until their 21st birthday to really celebrate becoming an adult. This is the traditional adult age not only in Australia, but also in the USA and the UK. It is their first year of true independence  .Traditionally, people were given a key to their houses by their parents when they turned 21, meaning they could come and go as they like. Even though 21 is the traditional adult age in many English-speaking countries, the law nowadays is different in each country. In the UK, you can join the army at 16 and even get married at 16 if your parents allow. Young people in the UK can learn to drive a car at 17 as in Australia, although they have to wait until they are 18 to vote. In China, there is a different age for each of the stages of becoming an adult. You can vote and learn to drive a car when you are 18, but if you want to get married, women have to wait until they are 20 and men until they are 22. Chinese people celebrate important birthdays every 10 years--so when young people turn 20, they can expect a big party! No matter what age you are, becoming an adult is really about learning how to be independent and responsible . Once you are finally able to take care of yourself and make your own decisions, then you can say that you are truly all grown-ups. Answer:","output":"Question: At what age do people generally become adults in different places around the world, and what milestones are associated with reaching adulthood?

First came the Tamworth Two, now the Durham Duo. Two little black pigs brought drama to the coastal town of Seaham after escaping from an allotment. Police raced into action as traffic was held up by the runaway pair, and one was last night under arrest after being found rooting for food in a waste bin. Pig hunt: Two of the animals went on the run yesterday but this one was caught after it stopped to raid a bin for a bite to eat. But its friend continued to show. officers a clean pair of trotters and, as night fell, the trail was as. cold as a frozen pork chop. The drama in Seaham, six miles south. of Sunderland, is reminiscent of the famous dash for freedom made by. Butch and Sundance – the Tamworth Two – in 1998. The story of the Tamworth Two was later made into a hour-long BBC television drama. They cheated the butcher’s knife by. going on the run from an abattoir, swimming the River Avon and. disappearing into a dense thicket. They were eventually caught but,. thanks to the Daily Mail, were given a reprieve from their death. sentence and lived out their days in an animal sanctuary. All went quiet in the sphere of. porcine escapology until Wednesday evening, when the two black pigs –. thought  to be Berkshire crossbreeds – made  a break from Hill Crescent. Allotments  in Seaham. One of the runaways was lassoed by. 37-year-old mother-of-three Shereen Temple, who found it in a back alley. with its snout in an overflowing bin. She is keeping it on her own. allotment until it can be reunited with its friend. Piggy dinner: This little hog was nabbed on Fox Street but his friend from the allotments is still on the loose. Neighbourhood sergeant Jim Peel of. said: 'The owner of the pigs normally whistles at them to get them to. come back. Everyone is keeping an eye out for the one which is still. missing.' Police officers were alerted to the. escapees after being called when one of the pigs was seen trotting along. the middle of the road heading towards the Dawdon Welfare Pub in the. town. Sightings of the new fugitives were reported on social networking sites as they caused mayhem around Seaham. Dan Johnson Stafford commented via Facebook said: 'Not every day you see a pig holding up the traffic lol.' Safe: The captured pig, nicknamed Porky, is now being looked after back at the allotments but is missing his partner in crime. Helpers: Painter and decorator Shereen Temple lassoed Porky with the help of her son Robert, 11. Munching: It was this pig's prodigious appetite that caught up with it last night, and he is now being fed fresh fruit and vegetables among other delights. After capturing one of the pigs, Seaham Police tweeted: 'After struggling for 30 mins we caught the pig in Fox Street in Seaham.' Miss Temple, who helped to catch one of the runaway pigs last night. The painter and decorator helped to lasso the pig in a back alley after it was cornered by police. 'He was found in a back lane that was full of rubbish,' she said. 'He was scared when we found him, I tried to catch him but he scarpered down  the alley. 'I tried to lasso it once with a dog lead but it slipped away the first time  and the second time I managed to loop it around it's neck. 'The pig has been nicknamed Porky by some, everyone's talking about him.' Idyllic: The seaside town of Seaham is said to have been thrown into chaos by the fleeing pigs. Captured: The one pig intercepted was spotted trotting towards the Dawdon Welfare Pub. Shereen kept the pig in her allotment where she keeps 14 chickens. She also owns two horses which are kept in stables, enjoying fresh food including carrots, apples, grass roots  and some horse feed. 'He's having a good time digging up my vegetables and he's being kept  in the chicken shed for now. 'Apparently the other pig was seen near the allotments this morning, and he was caught but he got away before the officers came to rescue him. 'It's been quite exciting helping to catch them - we just want to reunite him with the other one - we don't know if it's his brother or not.' While the RSPCA took in the runaway pig, the other has still not yet been found. Police were made aware of a sighting of the other pig at Seaham Harbour around 11pm last night but when they attended, the pig could not be found. Another sighting was reported at around 8am this morning, but again when officers arrived at the scene, the pig had once again escaped. Parallels: This latest escape has reminded people of dynamic duo 'The Tamworth Two' Sundance, left, and Butch, who went on the run from an abattoir. Neighbourhood Sergeant Jim Peel said: 'We had a call around 8pm last night to say that there was a pig on the loose. 'It was running around the roads in Seaham. 'Two PCSOs and response officers attended and they chased the pig into a back alley where the pig was detained. 'That was it for about an hour until a second pig was reported to also be loose. 'About 11pm last night there was a second call saying that a pig was running around Strangford Road, Seaham. 'However when officers searched the area, no pig was found. 'Another call came in around 8am this morning to say that a pig had been seen on Mount Stewart Street in Seaham. 'A further area search revealed no signs of the pig, meaning there is still an animal on the loose.'

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Who is the offensive coorindator for the Ohio State University football team and coached the Indiana Hoosiers football team in 2013? The answer to this question is:","output":"Kevin Wilson. Wilson is the current offensive coordinator and tight ends coach for the Ohio State University football team, a position he has held since the 2017 season. Prior to his role at Ohio State, he served as the head football coach for the Indiana Hoosiers from 2011 to 2016. Kevin Wilson began his coaching career at his alma mater, the University of North Carolina, as a graduate assistant in 1984. He continued his coaching journey at several colleges and universities before joining the Indiana Hoosiers football team as their head coach in 2011. During his tenure at Indiana, Wilson was able to reshape the Hoosiers' offense into one of the most productive units in the country, leading the team to back-to-back bowl appearances in 2015 and 2016. However, Wilson resigned as head coach in December 2016 following various accusations of player mistreatment, which led to an investigation by the university. Indiana University ultimately found that he did not meet their \\"standards for behavior,\\" and the two parties agreed on a mutual separation. Shortly afterward, in January 2017, Wilson was hired by the Ohio State University as their offensive coordinator and tight ends coach under then-head coach Urban Meyer. In his new role, Wilson has helped the Buckeyes' offense become one of the most potent in college football. Under his and head coach Ryan Day's guidance, the team has consistently ranked among the top offenses in the NCAA, breaking numerous school records in the process. Not only has Kevin Wilson been adept at coordinating offenses and calling plays, but he has also demonstrated his ability to develop young talent, including mentoring several players who have gone on to have successful careers in the NFL.

Question What may be the reason its s good to lose a few matches ? Answer:","output":"There are several reasons why it is good to lose a few matches in any sport, including tennis. Losing is an essential part of the learning process, and it offers numerous opportunities for growth and development. Here are some reasons why losing a few matches can be beneficial: 1. Learning from mistakes: Losses often highlight areas where the player can improve. By examining the mistakes made during a match, a player can identify their weaknesses and work on them to become a stronger competitor. For example, they may need to work on their footwork, serve, or mental toughness. 2. Building resilience: Losing can help build resilience and mental strength in an individual. It teaches them to cope with setbacks and adversity, which is important not only in sports but also in life. Learning to handle disappointments and bouncing back from them can help a person develop a strong mindset that can be applied to other areas of life. 3. Developing a growth mindset: Losing can foster a growth mindset, where players believe that they can improve their skills through hard work and dedication. This mindset encourages them to focus on progress and growth rather than solely on winning. Players with a growth mindset are more likely to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a way to improve. 4. Encouraging humility and sportsmanship: Losing teaches humility and sportsmanship. Recognizing that nobody can win every match helps players handle both wins and losses gracefully. Exhibiting good sportsmanship – acknowledging an opponent's skills, being respectful, and showing courtesy – is an important part of being a well-rounded athlete. 5. Enhancing motivation: Sometimes, losing can fuel a player's motivation and drive them to work harder. The desire to improve and perform better in future matches can be a strong motivator for increased practice, focus, and dedication to the sport. 6. Appreciating victories: Having experienced losses can make a person appreciate their victories more. Understanding the effort and growth that is necessary to achieve a win can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when it happens. 7. Gaining experience: Each match, whether won or lost, provides valuable experience. Players can develop their game strategies, learn to manage their emotions under pressure, and adapt to different playing styles of their opponents. Experience is crucial in becoming a skilled and well-rounded competitor. In conclusion, losing a few matches can be a good thing for a player's long-term development in tennis. Losses provide opportunities for growth and learning, instilling valuable life lessons, and building character. With the right mindset and approach, players can use their losses as stepping stones toward becoming better athletes and individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Juggler Movie plot: A man finds himself running from both the police and his own troubling memories in this drama. Hans Muller (Kirk Douglas), a German Jew, was once a well-known juggler before he was committed to a concentration camp; Muller survived, but his wife and children did not. After the war, Muller and many other displaced people found themselves in a temporary camp in Israel; his experiences have left him upset and confused, and several of the guards notice that he's behaving oddly. Muller flees the camp after one day, but while running away, he's stopped by Kogan (Richard Benedict), an Israeli policeman. When Kogan asks to see Muller's papers, he immediately flashes back to an unsetting memory in which a Nazi officer asked the same question; Muller panics, attacks the cop, and flees for Mount Carmel. In the morning, Muller encounters a group of children who believe the story he tells them: that he's a tourist from the United States. One of them, Yehoshua (Joseph Walsh), is making his way to a kibbutz in Syria, and Muller, who hopes to get to some friends in Egypt, joins him. Muller entertains the young man by teaching him to juggle, and they become close friends. When Yehoshua is injured by a land mine, Muller rushes him to a hospital, where he meets Ya'el (Milly Vitale), a woman who lost her husband to Arabs. A romance soon blossoms between Muller and Ya'el, and he confesses to her that he's on the run from the police; meanwhile, Israeli Detective Karni (Paul Stewart) is combing the nation, searching for the juggler -- not to arrest him, but to convince him that he's not wanted for murder, and that others want to help him. Michael Blankfort, who wrote the original novel upon which The Juggler was based, adapted the screenplay and also served as executive producer. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide My question: What country did Muller find himself in after the war?

Men are flocking to Pinterest Pinterest is quickly shaking the image that it’s just for women. A new survey, published this week, provides further proof that men are “pinning.” Men now make up 18% of Pinterest’s users, which is a 5% jump over last year, according poll commissioned by Ahalogy, a Pinterest marketing partner. Almost two thirds of men on the site have joined it in the last year, the poll notes. Sure, the vast majority of Pinterest’s users are still women. But the stereotype of Pinterest as being just for middle-aged Midwestern moms is shifting. Younger users are on the rise—67% of the active pinners surveyed were under the age of 40, compared with 49% a year ago. Hispanic users also grew from 3% in 2014 to 9% of the sites users, according to the survey. The poll surveyed 1,015 Web users, 505 of which used Pinterest at least once a month. Of that group, 206 used Pinterest every day. The full survey is available on Ahalogy’s website. More notable to Pinterest advertisers, the study shows 47% of Pinterest users are aware of the site’s new ad formats but don’t mind them. That’s up from 35% last year. I’m wary of this result, since Ahalogy has a vested interest in promoting that idea. But it is hardly a surprise; in fact, it has been the promise of Pinterest all along. It’s the driving force behind Pinterest’s 11 billion valuation. On other social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, people are there to socialize. On Pinterest, which CEO and co-founder Ben Silbermann has said is not a social network, but a place to save things for later, people are in shopping mode. In many cases, they’re saving things for later in order to possibly buy them. Pinterest users are in consumption mode, the thinking goes, so conversion rates will be through the roof. It’s been called “a capitalist’s dream.” Almost half of Pinterest users surveyed by Ahalogy say they use Pinterest instead of browsing catalogs. Pinterest is their “go-to” source for DIY and crafts, home decor, and weddings, the survey said. Pinterest’s ad product, Promoted Pins, is only a year old and the company hasn’t provided any results or case studies from advertisers. But the survey indicates (conveniently) that brands have a vital place on the platform. A whopping 83% of active pinners said they’d rather follow their favorite brand than their favorite celebrity. Nearly three quarters said they’d rather follow their favorite beauty brand than favorite makeup artist. The study reports similar results for baby products over baby experts, designer brands over fashion icons, and hair care brands over celebrity stylists. Nearly three quarters of active pinners say they bought something because they saw it on Pinterest. Now, pinners can shop directly on Pinterest. The company introduced a “buy button” earlier this summer after years of anticipation. In July, Silberman was quick to point out at Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference that Pinterest’s core business will be advertising, and it will not make money on the buy button. Rather, the buy button is a way to streamline the shopping process for users. It’s probably a wise move to focus on advertising. Pinterest may a tool for consumption, but advertising, with its high margins and lack of physical inventory, is a better business to be in than commerce. If, as this survey indicates, users both notice the ads and truly don’t mind them, then Pinterest will have solved the Web’s “original sin.” Sign up for Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily morning newsletter about the business of technology.

Sentence:","output":"The ALCO RS-3 (American Locomotive Company Road Switcher model 3) is a historic and significant diesel-electric locomotive built by the American Locomotive Company in the United States. This locomotive model, which was first introduced in 1950, was an important development in the transportation industry, significantly contributing to the gradual replacement of steam-powered engines with diesel-electric technology in the mid-20th Century. As a Road Switcher model, the ALCO RS-3 was designed to perform tasks both in the yard and out on the main line, demonstrating its versatility in various types of rail operations. Equipped with an ALCO 244 V12 engine, the ALCO RS-3's powertrain was one of the largest and most powerful of its time. The V12 engine configuration is an internal combustion engine with 12 inline cylinders arranged in a V-shape, with six cylinders on one side and six on the other. The engine displacement is approximately 8,000 cubic inches (131 liters), which allows it to generate a remarkable 1,600 horsepower for effective hauling and switching capabilities. Moreover, the use of the V12 engine provided a more compact design compared to a Straight-12 configuration, which in turn made it easier to accommodate within the locomotive's frame and body. The ALCO 244 V12 engine also featured an intricate fuel injection system which showed improvement in fuel efficiency and performance over earlier models in this series. The diesel-electric system in the ALCO RS-3 works by converting the mechanical energy produced by the diesel engine into electrical energy. This electrical energy is then used to power the electric traction motors connected to the locomotive's wheels, providing smooth, efficient, and powerful tractive force for diverse rail operations. This advanced technology became a staple and inspiration for the development of subsequent generations of diesel-electric locomotives in the industry. The ALCO RS-3 was popular among various railroad companies, with over 1,300 units being built before production ceased in 1956. As a testament to its durability and longevity, many of these locomotives continued operating well into the late 20th Century. In addition, the renowned ALCO 244 V12 engine was used not only in this model but also in several other ALCO designs, demonstrating the legacy and impact of the engine's efficiency and power. In conclusion, the ALCO RS-3, a diesel-electric locomotive boasting the powerful ALCO 244 V12 engine, has left an enduring mark in the transition from steam to diesel-electric technology within the railway industry. With its exceptional performance, reliability, and flexibility in various operations, this locomotive has greatly contributed to the history and development of modern rail transportation systems, showcasing significance in both the mechanical and technological aspects of the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These amazing pictures show the life-or-death struggle faced by Kurdish fighters as they battle through rubble-strewn streets against ISIS extremists in the battle for Syrian border town of Kobane. Images from the front-line show the trail of destruction left in the town, where weeks of fighting have taken place as Islamic State militants make their advances. US-led air strikes have hit jihadist positions in the north and east of Syria today, including an oil field, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Armed Kurdish fighters are seen holding guns as they cower in one of the many destroyed buildings in the town of Kobane in Syria. A man armed with two guns walks through the streets of Kobane as Kurdish fighters mark the front-line in the battle against jihadists. The destruction left after weeks of fighting in the town, which has seen most of its 55,000 residents flee and attempt to seek refuge. A Kurdish fighter takes a moments rest whilst lying among debris yesterday. According to the group the movement of ISIS has slowed. Us-led airstrikes were launched on jihadist positions in the north and east of Syria today after militant shelling killed two civilians. The raids against ISIS came after militants shelled a camp for those displaced from Kobane - known as Ain al-Arab in Arabic - and killed two people, said the monitoring group. A spokesperson for the Observatory said: 'Four explosions were heard during the night in Deir Ezzor province [in eastern Syria], caused by US-Arab air strikes in the area of the Tanak oil field and an IS checkpoint... killing two people.' The Britain-based monitoring group, which relies on a network of sources on the ground for its reports, said it was unclear whether the casualties were jihadists or civilians. It has reported that four other people were injured, including a child, at the camp for people forced from Kobane by violence. These up-close and personal images show what life is really like in Kobane for Kurdish fighters, who are backed by Iraqi peshmerga. Kobane, which lies on the border with Turkey, has been besieged by IS for nearly two months as fighters stand guard for battle. In September ISIS launched a full scale assault on Kobane from the west and south of the town, destroying homes and buildings. An exploded mortar shell is seen lying in the streets in front of what might have once been a shop, which has seen been destroyed. The US-led coalition, which launched strikes against jihadist positions in Syria in September, also hit IS militants - which controls most oil fields in Deir Ezzor province - in Kobane. The town on the border with Turkey has been besieged by IS for nearly two months and these latest photographs show Syrian Kurdish fighters armed and ready for battle as their town lies in ruins. Men are seeing carrying guns in the streets, while other armed fighters hide in one of the many destroyed buildings. The Kurdish forces, backed by rebels and Iraqi peshmerga fighters, have been battling to expel IS from the town, where most of the 55,000 residents have fled. A Kurdish fighter is seen running through the streets of Kobane where violent fighting has broken out as ISIS tries to capture the town. The town has been left virtually empty as almost 90 per cent of its population has fled to seek refuge - mostly in neighbouring Turkey. Iraqi Kurdish regional government delivered two truckloads of ammunition that secretly crossed into the town via Turkey on Wednesday. Separately, the Syrian Observatory said fighting on Thursday night near Lebanon killed 31 combatants loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and 14 rebels, including Al-Qaeda militants. There has been frequent violence in Syria's Mount Hermon, but the toll over recent days has been unprecedented. In recent weeks, Lebanon has all but closed the border officially to incoming Syrian refugees, with troops bolstering border security. More than 1.1 million Syrian refugees are living in Lebanon, straining the country's limited resources and infrastructure. Thick plumes of grey smoke rise from an ISIS position in eastern Kobane, after an airstrike by the U.S-led coalition. The pillars of smoke, which swept across the skyline, could be seen from a hilltop outside Suruc on the Turkey-Syria border earlier today. Last week ISIS released images of their fighters engaging in street fighting in Kobane as part of their latest publicity stunt. The pictures, distributed by the media office in the ISIS 'capital' of Raqqa in Syria, show jihadis firing rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles in the ruined streets of the town. Meanwhile, an international rights group claimed Islamic State militants tortured and abused Kurdish children captured earlier this year near the town. Human Rights Watch based its conclusions on interviews with several children who were among more than 150 Kurdish boys from Kobane abducted in late May as they were returning home after taking school exams in the city of Aleppo. It said around 50 of the Kurds escaped early in their captivity, while the rest were released in batches - the last on October 29. An ISIS militant fires a rocket-propelled grenade in the the streets of Kobane. This picture was issued by the Raqqa Media Office of ISIS.

(CNN) -- Branden Grace duly completed his front running victory at the Dunhill Links Championships Sunday after coming under last round pressure from Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen at St Andrews.  Grace, winning for the fifth time in a superb 2012, four coming on the European Tour, ended two ahead of Olesen after carding a final round 70 for a record 22-under total in the tournament.  \\"It feels awesome,\\" the South African told the official European Tour website after a victory that has lifted him to third in the The Race to Dubai.  He has now targeted No.1 Rory McIlroy in the battle for the overall honors in Europe.  \\"It's definitely in my sights,\\" he said.  Grace, who is yet another graduate of the Ernie Els Foundation, led from the first round at Kingsbarns where he shot a stunning 12-under 60.  But when Olesen carded two straight birdies around the turn and Grace three-putted the short 11th for a bogey, they were level.  But Grace pulled away with a stunning hat-trick of birdies only interrupted by a bogey on the Road Hole 17th.  He still had a two-shot lead playing the last which they both birdied.  Alexander Noren of Sweden finished third, four shots back, with Joel Sjoholm of Sweden in fourth.  Scot Stephen Gallacher, a former Dunhill winner, was making superb last day progress until he accidentally played the ball of an amateur partner Steve Halsall on the 16th fairway.  It cost him a two-shot penalty and he ended up running up a quadruple bogey to slip back into a tie for fifth.  1. How many times has grace won? 2. how does it feel? 3. where is Alexander from? 4.

The Jay Leno Show is an American talk show created by and starring Jay Leno. Premiering on NBC on September 14, 2009, the program aired on weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT through February 9, 2010. The program was modeled upon the format of a late night talk show--specifically, Jay Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show, opening with a comedic monologue, followed by interviews with celebrity guests and other comedy segments. Sketches from The Tonight Show (including Headlines and Jaywalking) were carried over to The Jay Leno Show, along with new sketches. Leno had a contract for five years  for the show. NBC reportedly had an option to cancel after two years, but had committed to at least one or two years regardless of ratings, although later chose to end the show after less than five months. He could have earned up to 30 million each year depending on ratings for Leno, compared to a 20 million annual salary during his last years at Tonight.  NBC expected to benefit by offering an inexpensive comedic alternative to the procedurals (\\"100% more comedy and 98% fewer murders!\\") and other one-hour dramas that typically air at 10 pm, and by offering new episodes 46 weeks each year versus 22. While Leno was not necessarily expected to be competitive with the higher-rated scripted shows on ABC and CBS in its time slot, its projected cost of production was far lower and thus it was expected to be profitable to the network, and product integration intended to make the show \\"as DVR-proof as you can be on television in this era\\". Each airing of Leno cost about 350,000 to 400,000 versus up to 3 million for an hour-long drama, saving NBC 13 million each week without the network needing the show to beat its competitors. Those costs include the services of 22 writers, whom Leno called the \\"top 5% of the highest-paid . . . in the Guild.\\"  McDonald's became the first buying advertiser for the program, tying in their \\"Million Dollar Roll\\" nightly in October 2009 promoting that year's version of McDonald's Monopoly. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was the show financially successful?","output":"Based on the quote \\"While Leno was not necessarily expected to be competitive with the higher-rated scripted shows on ABC and CBS in its time slot, its projected cost of production was far lower and thus it was expected to be profitable to the network,\\" it can be inferred that The Jay Leno Show was expected to be financially successful due to its lower production costs. However, it's important to note that the show ended after less than five months, which could indicate that it may not have met financial expectations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where does the weasel become frightened? ?  The cartoon starts with the arm of an animator drawing a farm scene. The farm scene then colors itself, and the camera zooms in just as the plot follows:  A realistic-looking horse is seen, whinnying (courtesy of Mel Blanc), and a comic triple plays out: The narrator asks the horse to do a trot; the horse obliges. The narrator asks for a gallop; the horse again obliges. The narrator then asks the horse to do a \\"canter\\". The horse turns from realistic to a cartoon horse, with the bugged eyes of, and singing \\"I'm Happy About the Whole Thing\\" (by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer) in the style of, the vaudeville star Eddie Cantor, vocally impersonated by Kent Rogers. The narrator admonishes the horse, which grins sheepishly. The family dog is seen lazing on the porch, springing to alertness when the newspaper arrives. The dog makes a mad dash to the end of the driveway, gets the paper, comes back to the porch, and immediately starts to read the paper himself, starting with the Sunday comics. He turns to the audience, and says, \\"I can hardly wait to see what happened to Dick Tracy!\\" (This gag would be used by Clampett again in The Great Piggy Bank Robbery.) A hen leaves her eggs unguarded, and a mean-looking weasel stealthily creeps into the henhouse while the narrator frets. Just as he is about to grab the eggs, they all hatch at once, and the chicks shout \\"BOO!\\" in unison. The frightened weasel evokes a Joe Penner catch-phrase, \\"Don't ever DOOO that!\\" and gasps as his heart pounds. An owl is hooting dully until it briefly smiles while saying \\"Who's Yehoodi?\\" A few birds put a little twig, a bit of string, and piece of straw until they make a house approved by the Federal Housing Administration, singing, \\"There's no place like home!\\" A worried field mouse with huge ears is asked about what worries him; he claims \\"I don't know, Doc. I...I just keep hearing things.\\" Answer:","output":"The weasel becomes frightened in the henhouse when the unguarded eggs hatch all at once, and the chicks shout \\"BOO!\\" in unison."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does word \\"pull\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? The pull of the moon. Iron fillings drawn by the pull of a magnet.","output":"In order to determine whether the word \\"pull\\" has the same meaning in both sentences, let's analyze the context and meaning of the word in each case. Step 1: Analyze the context of the first sentence - \\"The pull of the moon.\\" In this sentence, \\"pull\\" seems to refer to a force exerted by the moon. This force is gravitational in nature and affects the tides and other natural phenomena on Earth. Step 2: Analyze the context of the second sentence - \\"Iron fillings drawn by the pull of a magnet.\\" In this sentence, \\"pull\\" refers to the attractive force exerted by a magnet on iron fillings. This force is magnetic in nature and causes the iron fillings to be drawn towards the magnet. Step 3: Compare the meanings of \\"pull\\" in both sentences. Upon analyzing the context of both sentences, it becomes clear that the force exerted in each case is distinct, with one being gravitational and the other being magnetic. Despite this difference in the type of force, the general concept of an attractive force causing movement towards an object is consistent across both sentences. Conclusion: The word \\"pull\\" has a similar general meaning in both sentences - an attractive force causing movement towards an object. However, the specific nature of the force differs between the sentences: in the first sentence, it is gravitational, whereas, in the second sentence, it is magnetic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: It was a good feast. Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf.

The body of a young man found in the Providence River on Tuesday may be that of Sunil Tripathi, a student at Brown University who disappeared March 16, police told CNN. A Brown rowing coach reported a body in the river near India Point Park, Lindsay Lague, a spokeswoman for the Providence Police Department, said Wednesday. Lague said authorities may be able to identify the body as soon as Thursday morning. When asked if it might be Tripathi, Detective Mark Sacco said it was \\"likely\\" but was cautious to say they won't know who it is until the medical examiner makes a determination. The body is a man between the ages of 18 and 30, he said. The Tripathi family's search for the 22-year-old philosophy major has been detailed on a Facebook page, \\"Help us find Sunil Tripathi.\\" They temporarily took down the page after they were inundated by ugly comments when Sunil Tripathi was falsely accused on social media of being one of the Boston Marathon bombers. After the FBI released images of Suspect 1 and Suspect 2, people took to sites such as Reddit, a real-time message board, and Twitter speculating that Tripathi looked like one of the suspects. Reddit's general manager apologized to the Tripathi family for the misinformation. Tripathi was last seen in the early hours of March 16, recorded on a security video walking south on Brook Street in Providence, not far from his home. His last recorded computer activity was shortly before that sighting. \\"He was seen on the 15th, Friday, hanging out with his friends, talking to family members, all normal activities, nothing out of the ordinary that anyone detected,\\" his brother Ravi told CNN affiliate WPRI on April 10. Since then a desperate search has been on for Tripathi, known to family and friends as \\"Sunny.\\" Tripathi, who had been struggling with depression, was last seen wearing blue jeans, a black Eastern Mountain Sports ski jacket, glasses and a black Philadelphia Eagles wool hat. He was said to be 6 feet tall, 130 pounds, with short, dark hair. By March 17, nobody had seen him for 24 hours, and a friend became concerned and called the police. At that point, the family was notified and came up from Philadelphia as soon as they could, Ravi said. \\"We are a very tight-knit family, and it's very out of the ordinary that he would be not in contact for even 24 hours,\\" Ravi told WPRI. \\"He spoke with his aunt, he spoke with his grandmother Friday night, he texted with my mum, all normal activities, and then his cell phone was left in his apartment along with his wallet and ID, which is totally atypical for him.\\" The FBI and other agencies launched a search of Providence, Rhode Island, and nearby cities after he was reported missing, but no trace was found. Over the past month, Ravi has appeared on local and national networks appealing for help to find his sibling, the youngest of three. At the time he went missing, Sunil Tripathi was on approved leave from the Ivy League school, meaning that he had requested and was granted time off but remained a student there. Sunil had taken the time off to figure out exactly what he wanted to do, Ravi told WPRI. He described his brother as a quiet person who enjoyed the little things in life. His preferred food was vegetarian and he was a talented saxophonist, the family said. \\"Our concerns are first and foremost with Sunil and his family,\\" Margaret Klawunn, vice president for student life and campus services at Brown University, said last month. \\"We are hopeful that by encouraging the Brown community to help spread the word that Sunil will be located.\\" Sunil had been living in Providence since 2008 but grew up in Radnor, Pennsylvania. The family, including Sunil's sister, Sangeeta, tried to find him by re-creating the sequence of events early on March 16, in the hope of finding a clue to where he might have gone. They also got the word out by posting fliers, canvassing the area, working with law enforcement and sought to harness the power of social media. A tweet a week ago on the family's Twitter page, Finding Sunny, said: \\"Sunny day. We're out in Providence postering away -- learning the nooks and crannies of every block of this town.... \\" A moving video was posted on YouTube on April 8, simply titled \\"For Sunny,\\" in which family and friends appeal for him to come home, telling him how much they love him and want to see him. The family \\"want to know that he's safe,\\" Ravi told WPRI just six days before the Boston bombing. \\"All we really want to know is that he's around and that he's okay. \\"And we would like him to know that we love him deeply and we miss him a lot.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. A young man's body was found in the Providence River, possibly associated with the disappearance of a Brown University student, Sunil Tripathi, who vanished on March 16. The body has not been officially identified yet. 2.

A broad search aided by the FBI was launched across Providence and surrounding areas but no trace of Tripathi has been found. His brother, Ravi Tripathi, has made frequent appeals for aid in finding his sibling.  6.

He had been living in Providence since 2008 but was originally from Radnor, Pennsylvania. 7.

Question: Arithmetic and algebra are examples of what science? Context: Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.

The TO forces in the area were subordinated to the 1st Brigade of the TO, and Lieutenant Colonel General Milan Torbica. The HV deployed 250 troops, elements of the 113th and 142nd Infantry Brigades, commanded by Brigadier Kruno Mazalin. The HV had infiltrated the pink zone along three routes—via Nos Kalik, across the Čikola river and by boat sailing upstream along the Krka River, during the night of 20/21 June. The fighting began at 5 a.m. as the HV force, deployed in 26 squads, captured six out of seven villages on the plateau by the end of the morning. At 8:00 p.m., the HV captured the village of Ključ, and all of the plateau. The advance created a HV-held salient south of Knin, several kilometres deep. It also led the RSK artillery to bombard Šibenik and HV bombardment of Knin in response, both on 22 June. The artillery fire progressively intensified until 23 June, while the RSK mobilised and counterattacked against the HV positions at the Miljevci Plateau. However, the mobilisation yielded only 227 additional troops, and the counterattack failed. An UNPROFOR assessment concluded the situation might deteriorate further and engulf all of the pink zones. To address the situation, UNPROFOR military commander Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar met with Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia Milan Ramljak and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia General Anton Tus in Zagreb the same day, in order to discuss the developments on the Miljevci Plateau. Skirmishes continued on 24 June, accompanied by some artillery fire. Morale of the RSK troops plummeted though, causing a TO garrison based in nearby Trbounj to abandon its barracks.

Four hours later and 950 miles away, Cristiano Ronaldo's eyes were wide in anger as he shouted in protest just ahead of the final whistle, again arguing with a referee. The tirade got Ronaldo a second yellow card that would have suspended him for the next match. No worries, Portugal's World Cup ended, reports the AP. Saturday will likely mark the end of an era for the World Cup, a decade in which much of the hype has been about the best players in the world, the Spanish league rivals who have evenly split the last 10 FIFA Player of the Year Awards. Once again, both men have failed to replicate their club success for their countries. Messi is a week past his 31st birthday and Ronaldo 33, former phenoms unlikely to reach Qatar 2022. For both superstars, a World Cup title remained an unreachable star. On Saturday, they were both outshone by two Paris Saint-Germain teammates, CNN notes, France's Kylian Mbappe and Uruguay's Edinson Cavani. Messi hasn't won a senior title with his nation, losing finals at the 2014 World Cup, and the 2007, '15 and '16 Copa Americas, the last when Messi failed on his penalty kick during a shootout. He faced massive criticism at home and retired from the national team only to be lured back for this World Cup cycle. Ronaldo lost a World Cup semifinal in 2006 but never got past the second round again. They were soccer's yin and yang, Messi understated and distant, Ronaldo flamboyant with a model girlfriend and attention-grabbing hairdos. They are global spokesmen, Ronaldo for Nike, Toyota, and more; Messi for the likes of Adidas and Pepsi. But their time at the top has come to an end. Expand this summary.","output":"The recent exits of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo from the World Cup signal the likely end of an era in which both players have dominated the international soccer scene for a decade. Despite their unmatched club success and numerous accolades, both icons have struggled to replicate their brilliance and bring home major international trophies for their respective nations, Argentina and Portugal. While Messi and Ronaldo have been fierce Spanish league rivals, their record of splitting the last 10 FIFA Player of the Year Awards highlights their remarkable individual accomplishments. However, international triumphs have proven elusive for both stars. With Messi turning 31 recently, and Ronaldo at 33, it is improbable that they will make it to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Messi's international trophy cabinet remains bare, with the Argentine superstar failing to win a senior title with his nation. He has experienced defeats in the finals at the 2014 World Cup and Copa America tournaments in 2007, 2015, and 2016. Notably, his missed penalty kick during a shootout in the 2016 Copa America finals invited an immense barrage of criticism. He briefly retired from the national team before eventually being drawn back for this World Cup cycle. Ronaldo, on the other hand, reached the World Cup semifinals with Portugal in 2006 but failed to progress beyond the second round in subsequent campaigns. Known for his flamboyance, Ronaldo has been a global spokesperson for companies such as Nike and Toyota, while Messi represented major brands like Adidas and Pepsi. On June 30, both soccer greats were outperformed by their Paris Saint-Germain teammates, France's Kylian Mbappe and Uruguay's Edinson Cavani. As Messi and Ronaldo's international careers reach their twilight, it is a bittersweet reminder of the transient nature of sporting greatness, and a testament to a thrilling chapter in soccer history characterized by these two illustrious icons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

James Corbin, a Blacksmith D. Horseshoeing is a Good Way to Make a Living Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: New York is one of the last large American cities to have some of its policemen on horseback. The New York police have 170 horses working in certain parts of the city. The horses are expensive to feed, but it is even more expensive to look after them. Because the horses must walk on the streets, they need special horseshoes. In fact , they need more than 8,000 of them each year. Every police horse in New York gets new shoes every month. Keeping these shoes in good repair is the job of six blacksmiths. There are only about thirty-five of these blacksmiths in the whole United States. The cost of shoing a horse is between twenty dollars and thirty-five dollars, and it takes a good blacksmith two or three hours to do the job. A blacksmith's job is not an easy one. He must be able to shape a shoe from a piece of metal and then fit it to the horse's foot. The blacksmith must bend over all the time when he is fitting the shoe and must hold the weight of the horse's leg while he works. Clearly, a blacksmith must be very storng. But even more important, he must be able to deal with horses---for before the blacksmith can begin his work, he has to get the horse to lift its leg. One of the blacksmiths in New York is James Corbin. He came to the country from Ireland in 1948. He not only makes horseshoes for the police but also works for a group of horse owners near the city. Corbin became interested in blacksmithing because his father did it, and,as the puts it, \\"It's a good way to make a living.\\" Question: The best title for the passage is \\"  _  \\".

Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what money is used in mozambique?\\" A:","output":"A: Mozambique uses a currency called the Mozambican Metical as its primary form of money. The Metical is abbreviated by the symbol MZN and its plural form is \\"Meticais\\". It is further divided into 100 smaller units, known as centavos. The Mozambican Metical has been the official currency of the country since June 16, 1980, when it replaced the Mozambican Escudo. The metical has undergone two homonymic redenominations, first in 2006 and then again in 2008, each time resetting the currency's value in order to address inflation and instability concerns. In the second redenomination, 1 new metical (MZN) was equal to 1,000 old meticais (MZM). Banknotes in circulation vary in denominations and come in values of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 meticais. Each banknote features prominent Mozambican historic figures, cultural references, and depictions of the local flora and fauna. Additionally, a series of coins are also minted and used in the country, including denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 centavos, as well as 1, 2, 5, and 10 meticais coins. The metical is controlled and regulated by the Bank of Mozambique (Banco de Moçambique), the central bank of the country. The stability and value of the Mozambican Metical are dependent on factors such as internal economic growth, political stability, and the global financial market. In some cases, especially in tourist areas or large cities, the US dollar, South African rand, and sometimes the Euro may also be accepted for transactions. However, it is essential to have meticais on hand for smaller purchases and for use in rural areas. It is important to note that the exchange rates may vary, and it is wise to check updated rates before any currency transactions. In order to exchange foreign currency for meticais, travelers can use banks, bureaux de change, or ATMs located in major cities or at the airport. However, it is advised to carry cash in small denominations while visiting Mozambique, as finding change for larger denominations can be challenging. Credit card facilities may be limited, especially outside of urban centers or international hotels. As a result, it is always crucial to plan ahead and have adequate cash available for any expenses that may arise during a visit to Mozambique."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - Utah (or ) is a state in the western United States. It became the 45th state admitted to the U.S. on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 31st-most-populous, and 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States.

He currently lives and works in Hiko, Nevada.  - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado.

It is a census-designated place, with a population of 119 at the 2010 census. Hiko was the county seat of Lincoln County from 1867 to 1871 and a few hundred residents lived nearby, due largely to silver mines in the area. Today, the area is a farming and ranching area, and not much remains of the old town except the cemetery, some mill ruins and a red rock building that was a general store. Although populated, Hiko appears on at least two ghost town lists. Most of the residents of Hiko own farms or ranches, and little to no industrial activity takes place there. In 1871 Hiko was replaced as the county seat of Lincoln County with the current seat, Pioche.  - City is a piece of earth art located in Garden Valley , a desert valley in rural Lincoln County in the U.S. state of Nevada , near the border with Nye County .

Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.  - Land art, earthworks (coined by Robert Smithson), or Earth art is an art movement in which landscape and the work of art are inextricably linked. It is also an art form that is created in nature, using natural materials such as soil, rock (bed rock, boulders, stones), organic media (logs, branches, leaves), and water with introduced materials such as concrete, metal, asphalt, or mineral pigments. Sculptures are not placed in the landscape, rather, the landscape is the means of their creation. Often earth moving equipment is involved. The works frequently exist in the open, located well away from civilization, left to change and erode under natural conditions. Many of the first works, created in the deserts of Nevada, New Mexico, Utah or Arizona were ephemeral in nature and now only exist as video recordings or photographic documents. They also pioneered a category of art called site-specific sculpture, designed for a particular outdoor location.    What is the relationship between 'city ' and 'land art'? A:","output":"The relationship between 'City' and 'land art' is that 'City' is a specific example of land art. 'City' is a large-scale earth art project created by artist Michael Heizer in Garden Valley, Nevada. Land art, also known as earthworks or Earth art, is an art movement where the landscape and the work of art are closely linked. In this movement, artists create art using natural materials found in nature, such as soil, rock, organic media, and water. In the case of 'City', it is a massive sculpture built using materials from the surrounding environment, making it a prime example of land art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: Then Harford is found to be an interloper. Hypothesis: The Harford was identified as an interloper. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise states that \\"Then Harford is found to be an interloper.\\" This suggests that at some point in time, it is discovered or revealed that Harford is indeed an interloper. Based on this information, we can infer a few things. Firstly, that there must have been previous uncertainties or doubts regarding Harford's true status or involvement, potentially concealed or undisclosed. Secondly, the discovery involves a moment or event that ultimately confirms Harford's interloper status. Now, let's examine the hypothesis which states, \\"The Harford was identified as an interloper.\\" This proposition posits that someone or something recognized or determined that Harford is an interloper. Similar to the premise, this implies that Harford's status as an interloper matters and is of consequence for the given situation. There's also the aspect that Harford's position as an interloper is distinct and recognizable by certain means. Comparing the premise to the hypothesis, we notice that both involve Harford being recognized as an interloper. The main difference lies in the keywords \\"found\\" and \\"identified.\\" \\"Found\\" suggests discovery after previous uncertainties, while \\"identified\\" implies recognition or distinction of the interloper status. However, considering the context of both statements, it is reasonable to assume that the process of identifying involved unveiling or discovering Harford's true status. With that said, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise, by stating that Harford is found to be an interloper, implies that a moment or event led to the discovery of Harford's true nature. In the hypothesis, Harford's identification as an interloper inherently involves recognizing and distinguishing the interloper status as a result of the same discovery. Both statements convey the same general idea that Harford was ultimately considered an interloper, despite potentially having concealed or undisclosed intentions beforehand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Not all Indian states have a bicameral legislative structure; only a few states possess a Legislative Council in addition to a Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha). According to Article 169 of the Indian Constitution, the Parliament can create or dissolve the Legislative Council in a state if the State Legislative Assembly passes a resolution for the same with a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting. As of now, there are six states in India where there is a Vidhan Parishad for legislative purposes: 1. Andhra Pradesh: The Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council was established in 1958 but was abolished in 1985. It was re-established in 2007 and currently has 58 members. 2. Bihar: The Bihar Legislative Council is a permanent house and was created in 1958, with a total strength of 75 members.  3. Karnataka: The Karnataka Legislative Council was established in 1957 and comprises 75 members. 4. Maharashtra: The Maharashtra Legislative Council consists of 78 members and has been in existence since 1960. 5. Telangana: The Telangana Legislative Council was established in 2014, after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and has 40 members. 6. Uttar Pradesh: The Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council was established in 1958 and holds the distinction of being the largest Legislative Council in India, with 100 members. These six states have both Vidhan Sabhas (Legislative Assemblies) and Vidhan Parishads (Legislative Councils) for legislative purposes. Vidhan Parishads have a role similar to that of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of the Parliament) at the state level, providing a platform for discussing and reviewing bills passed by the Vidhan Sabha. It is important to note that the presence of a Vidhan Parishad does not significantly influence the legislative process in a state, as the Vidhan Sabha remains the primary house for legislation. However, it does add an additional layer of scrutiny and review for proposed bills before they become laws."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is taking a part-time  Ivy League teaching gig  after saying earlier this year that the chairmanship should be a âfull time job.â  Perez  made the comment in late 2016 when  he  joined the competition for the DNC post against Ralph Ellison  a full-time Minnesota Democratic congressman  and while  Perez  was still pondering a 2018 run for Maryland governor.  He  also reportedly said at the time that the party needs to have âsomeone committed here for the long haul.\\" Washington Republicans pounced on the announcement Thursday that  Perez  would be a senior fellow at  his  alma mater  Brown University. âThe DNC canât raise money  their âBetter Dealâ slogan flopped  the Unity Tours were a disaster -- and  Tom Perez  thinks itâs a good time for a side gig?â the Republican National Committee asked.

The announcement also comes a few weeks after the DNC posted its worst July fundraising numbers in a decade  raising questions about why the party machine cannot capitalize on President Trumpâs low approval ratings and whether  Perez  is up to the task. The DNC raised 3.8 million in July  compared to 10.2 million for the Republican National Committee. The tally fit a pattern for the Democrats  who have posted a string of depressed fundraising numbers month after month this year  even after  Perez  took charge in February.  Perez   after the small July haul was announced  attributed the disappointing results to understaffing and too few fundraisers as  he  tries to rebuild the group in the wake of 2016's damaging controversies. Many Democrats seem willing to extend  Perez  a longer honeymoon  considering the situation  he  inherited. The divide was clearly on display earlier this year during the DNCâs so-called Unity Tour  in which  Perez  and Ellison appeared on stage amid questions about whether the party should back pro-life candidates.","output":"To determine if the given sentiment towards Tom Perez is Neutral, let's break down the document into parts containing positive, negative, and neutral statements about Tom Perez: Positive: 1. Tom Perez was labor secretary under President Obama. Negative: 1. Tom Perez took a part-time teaching gig after saying the DNC chairmanship should be a full-time job. 2. The Republican National Committee criticized Tom Perez for taking a side gig while the DNC struggles. 3.

Question: Question: \\"Which grandfather of an heir to the throne of Sicily was an Emperor of Germany whose reign ended the period of instability that began with the death of a previous emperor in 1125?\\"  Context: \\"During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The grandfather of an heir to the throne of Sicily, who was also an Emperor of Germany and whose reign ended the period of instability that began with the death of a previous emperor in 1125, is Frederick I Barbarossa. He was a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and his reign as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Germany) extended from 1155 to 1190, during which he stabilized the empire after a period of disarray caused by the death of Emperor Henry V without any heirs. Frederick I Barbarossa was born in 1122 and became the Duke of Swabia in 1147 before being elected as the Holy Roman Emperor in 1155. He was a skilled military commander and renowned statesman, serving as a unifying figure in Germany during a time when the realm was plagued with tensions between various powerful dukes. His reign contributed to the restoration of imperial authority, which had been severely weakened during the period of instability following Emperor Henry V's death. One of Barbarossa's significant accomplishments lies in his efforts to bring about a balance of power by curbing the influence of the territorial dukes and strengthening the ties within the empire. He achieved this by reclaiming royal estates and imperial rights that had been lost during the earlier chaotic period, thus augmenting his power and central authority substantially. As part of his strategic objectives, Frederick I Barbarossa engaged in a number of military campaigns, most notably in Italy, to reassert imperial authority over the rebellious region. He participated in a series of wars against the Lombard League, an alliance formed by several Italian cities that opposed his rule. Significantly, he was also a leading figure in the crusade movement and undertook the Third Crusade in 1189, which, however, ended unsuccessfully with his unexpected death in 1190. As stated in the context, Frederick I Barbarossa was the grandfather of Frederick II, who ruled as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire from 1220 to 1250, in addition to being the heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother. His reign witnessed numerous conflicts with the papacy, often resulting in accusations of heresy leveled against him. In conclusion, Frederick I Barbarossa, a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, was the grandfather of an heir to the throne of Sicily. His tenure as the Emperor of Germany, spanning from 1155 to 1190, is credited for ending the period of instability that had gripped the empire since the passing of Emperor Henry V in 1125. By successfully restoring order and reestablishing imperial authority, Barbarossa laid the groundwork for his successors to build upon the relative stability that subsequently marked the empire during the 13th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was screaming as the ground rushed towards me. I was sure that I was going to die. Suddenly, I was awake, sweaty but amazingly alive. I was angry with myself.  According to popular stories I am to blame for the bad dream. I had eaten a big piece of cheese before bedtime. Cheese, says folk stories, causes nightmares. One minute I'm eating a piece of cheddar (a kind of cheese), the next _ 'm falling through a canyon  . It's not just folk stories that suggests Roquefort and Red Leicester (two types of cheese) give you nightmares. Scientists seem to agree. Cheese contains a substance that makes our bodies produce a chemical called serotonin. Serotonin slows down the heart and so our blood slows down around our bodies. When we're awake, this can lead to headaches. When we're asleep this gives us strong dreams. Cheese is also hard to digest and may make us sleep badly. We are more likely to wake during deep sleep and remember any dreams or nightmares. Don't think that removing cheese from your late night meals will stop the nightmares.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Q: Context_1 : The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Context_2 : Boats Against the Current is a 1977 album by Eric Carmen. The title is taken from a line in the novel \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne ceaselessly into the past.” It was Carmen's second solo LP, after the Raspberries disbanded. It peaked at #45 on the Billboard album chart. Context_3 : Samuel Manetoali (born January 24, 1969) is a member of the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands. He represents the Gao/Bugotu constituency in Isabel Province. He attended Lepi Primary School and then went on to do his secondary education at the prestigious King George Sixth National School in Honiara. He attended law school at the University of Papua New Guinea and graduated with an LLB degree and further unspecified qualifications from the University of Tasmania and University of South Australia. Prior to entering politics he worked in the country's Public Solicitors Office, then he worked as a private lawyer and a legal adviser to the Isabel Provincial Government. He first entered parliament in the 2006 general election and re-elected in the 2010 general election.. He served as the Solomon Islands' Minister of Police, National Security and Correctional Services in Prime Minister Derek Sikua's Cabinet until May 2009, when he was transferred to the position of Minister for Lands, Survey, and Housing. Following the 2010 general election, he remained in Cabinet, under new Prime Minister Danny Philip, as Minister for Tourism and Culture. In this year's (2014) general election which was held on the 19th November, he was voted in again for the third term with a landslide victory. . He contested as an independent candidate in last week's election.. As a lawyer, many people had expected more from him seeing that many world leaders including Barack Obama and Tony Abott are lawyers by profession and he appears to be a potential candidate for the prime minister's post given his experience as a politician (3 terms including the current term) and his noble profession. His current success in the recent election could be attributed to projects such as mini-fisheries projects that he established in the various villages in his constituency. He also helped the villages and communities by giving handouts such as roofing irons, outboard motor engines, fiber boats, solar panels, cash money and other form of support as a way to maintain and broaden his support. He also supported local tourism in his constituency by giving financial help to tourism operators such as on Sigana Island,albeit, tourism is still at its infant stage in his constituency. His other elixir to maintain his popularity and support is through facilitating and sending Bamboo Bands/groups notably the Hageulu bamboo band overseas for the promotion of tourism and culture for the country and he managed to do that in his capacity as the minister of Tourism and Culture in the Lilo-led government. He was also instrumental in establishing the Gao-Bugotu Cultural Festival initially held in Huali Village in Gao and in Sepi/Lepi Villages in Bugotu. Context_4 : Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval gun was a Japanese naval gun and coast defense gun used on destroyers, submarines and torpedo boats of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II. The proper title of the gun under the Japanese naval artillery naming system is 12 cm/45 3rd Year Type naval gun. Other guns using this naming system are the 41 cm/45 3rd Year Type naval gun, 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval gun, 15.5 cm/60 3rd Year Type naval gun and the 12.7 cm/50 Type 3 naval gun. Context_5 : The Lake Washington ferries in King County, Washington provided the only efficient means for transporting goods and passengers across the lake prior to the opening of the first floating bridge in 1940. The ferries ran between Kirkland, Bellevue, and Houghton across Lake Washington to East Madison Street in Seattle's Madison Park for ten cents each way. They soon became so popular that the King County Port Commission established a public ferry in 1900, competing with private boats. In 1913 a reconfigured side-wheeler steamboat, the wooden \\"Leschi\\", became the first Seattle-built automobile ferry. By 1922 the county ferry system was in such financial difficulty that it appointed its largest competitor to run the system. The 1940 opening of the Lake Washington floating bridge was the beginning of the end for the lake ferries. However, during World War II the ferries carried workers to the Lake Washington Shipyard, where auxiliary ships were built for the U.S. Navy, and made a tidy profit. A year after the tolls were removed from the floating bridge, the last ferry route was retired, and the boat was sold to the Washington State Ferries, which had taken over the Puget Sound Navigation Company in 1951. Context_6 : Monterey Boats, Williston, FL - founded 1985 in Archer Florida by the Marshall brothers, partners, co-chairmen and CEO of the company. From early beginnings with only two 19 foot runabout models Monterey took its first leap in 1989 introducing their first family cruiser. By the mid-1990s Monterey offered a complete line of Sport Boats and Express Cruisers. Today, Monterey Boats builds Sport Boats, Deck Boats, Cruisers and Sport Yachts from 18 to 41 feet. Recent years have seen Monterey Boats grow at a rapid rate, and today the company produces over 2,000 boats per year. Well regarded for its contemporary styling and above-average construction, Monterey has a reputation for customer satisfaction with the strongest warranty in the industry. Context_7 : La Merced is a barrio or a neighborhood of Mexico City defined by its socioeconomics and history rather than by an official designation. It extends over the southeast of the historic center of Mexico City and is one of the oldest sections of the city, established over 700 years ago by the Mexica as part of the founding of Tenochtitlan. Over its history the area was associated with commerce, first as a major docking area for boats bringing goods to Tenochtitlan/Mexico City on Lake Texcoco, later via canals as the lake was slowly drained. In the latter 19th century, the La Merced market was established in the area replacing the massive La Merced monastery which was almost completely destroyed in the 1860s. This market was established to centralize the marketing of foodstuffs for the city on one area. The first La Merced market was built in 1890 and then replaced by the current building in 1957, one of the largest traditional Mexican markets in Mexico City. In the 1980s, the wholesale function of this market was taken over by the newly constructed Centro de Abasto in the south of the city, with the barrio then going into economic and social decline. Although there have been efforts to revitalize the area and the La Merced market remains important, the area has problems with poverty, population loss and prostitution. Context_8 : Kite fishing is a fishing technique involving a kite from which hangs a drop line attached to a lure or bait. The kite is flown out over the surface of a body of water, and the bait floats near the waterline until taken by a fish. The kite then drops immediately, signaling to the fisherman that the bait has been taken, and the fish is then hauled in. Kites can provide the boatless fishermen access to waters that would otherwise be available only to boats. Similarly, for boat owners, kites provide a way to fish in areas where it is not safe to navigate such as shallows or coral reefs where fish may be plentiful. Context_9 : Operation Nordlicht (\\"Northern Light\\") was a German operation during the end of World War II. After Finland had made peace with the USSR, the Germans planned to fall back to defense lines built and equipped in advance across Finnish Lapland (Operation Birke). During the operation, the \\"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\\" gave an order to move from Operation Birke to Operation Nordlicht on 4 October 1944. This meant that instead of evacuating everything and then fortifying on the strong defensive positions German 20th Mountain Army was to retreat according to a set timetable to a new defense line in Lyngen, Norway. The Germans retreated using scorched earth tactics, and destroyed almost all buildings and all boats in Finnmark, thus denying the enemy any facilities in the area. These same tactics had already been used in Finnish Lapland. The retreat ended on January 30, 1945. A detailed account of 'the Nazis' scorched earth campaign in Norway' by Vincent Hunt includes statements by eyewitnesses, photographs taken at the time and a map of locations and prisoner of war camps. Context_10 : Pennsylvania Canal \\"(or sometimes Pennsylvania Canal system)\\" refers generally to a complex system of transportation infrastructure improvements including canals, dams, locks, tow paths, aqueducts, and viaducts. The Canal and Works were constructed and assembled over several decades beginning in 1824, the year of the first enabling act and budget items. It should be understood the \\"first use of any railway\\" in North America was the year 1826, so the newspapers and the Pennsylvania Assembly of 1824 applied the term then to the proposed Right of ways mainly for the canals of the Main Line of Public Works to be built across the southern part of Pennsylvania. Enacted before Railroads gestated during their infancy, the focus of the act was to create through building a canal system, the capability to ship heavy or bulk goods and connect Philadelphia to Pittsburgh—and \\"more importantly\\"—and \\"beyond\\" to the \\"new growth markets\\" in the developing territories reached by the Ohio River now called the midwest. Later, when updated in 1837 to reflect the experience of twelve years of toddler-railways, the term was also applied to railroads and new canals to be added to the state transportation system. As a crowning achievement, the Main Line of Public Works and the Pennsylvania Canal system topped 2100 ft in elevation by erecting the Allegheny Portage Railroad, which used a system of five inclines and five planes on each side of the Eastern Continental Divide at Cresson Pass in Cambria County to actually haul wheeled flat cars, which had halved canal boats placed on them, up and over the Allegheny Front and connect Pittsburgh to the Susquehanna. When finished in 1834 the trip from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh could be made in 3–5 days, weather conditions depending. fact_1 :  The title is taken from a line in the novel \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne ceaselessly into the past.” fact_2 : The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F.

The best thing you can do to improve your grades is focus and pay attention when the information is first presented to you. It's easy to lose focus when your teacher is going on and on about something that's  not interesting, but you should not tune them out. Really listen to what they're saying and keep yourself engaged by asking questions and taking notes. . It might seem silly, but notes are actually a great way to help you improve your grades. Good notes are like a road map, when you go to study later on. They'll also show your teachers that you're serious about doing better in your classes. You don't have to write down everything your teacher says: just get down the basics. You know when you tell your parents about what happened to you during the day? That's how you should take notes. Just get the broad strokes, with the really important things written with greater detail.  If you know something is confusing to you or seems really complex, write that down too! Even if you don't understand what your teacher is saying, you'll have a note to yourself that you need to look that up and get more information later. Write out your notes by hand, instead of on a computer. You will have an easier time remembering them this way. When you don't understand a concept or fact that your teachers talks about in lecture or that you encounter in your text books, don't be afraid to ask! Smart people don't just know everything instantly...they're curious enough to ask and find out when they don't know something.  If you're nervous about asking in front of everyone else, you can also talk to your teacher outside of class time and ask about getting some extra help or explanation. You also shouldn't feel like your teacher would be angry about you not understanding. Teachers are happy when you're interested enough and invested enough to ask for help. If your teacher doesn't explain it in a way that you can understand or if you still feel uncomfortable, try going on the Internet to find a new explanation. You can often find YouTube videos covering common school concepts, and there are also forums and other websites that might deal with your question and explain it to you better. Your teacher will probably give you a syllabus at the beginning of the year or semester. This is a written outline of all of the subjects you will study over the course of the year. You should go over this syllabus carefully and ask your teacher about anything on it that doesn't make sense. Paired with your notes, it's another great road map to your learning. You might not realize it, but your problems concentrating might be because you're hungry! Try eating a small snack between classes, as well as a drink of water, in order to help your brain concentrate and have the best chance at absorbing the material. Your snack should be high in protein, which will give you the most energy. Try salami sticks or a handful of almonds or soy nuts. Everyone learns in different ways. Some people learn better when they're moving and using their body. Some people learn better with lots of pictures and visuals. Some people learn better when they can hear things like words and music. Think about what helps you remember things the most and then find ways to work that into how you learn your course material.  For example, if you're an auditory learner (someone who learns better with sounds), ask your teacher if you can record lectures to listen to again later. If you don't know your learning style, you can take a test here or you can take any number of other online tests. You can also just analyze your own classroom experiences. If you're a visual learner, draw up some charts or webs which visually represent the information you need to learn and how the ideas are connected.","output":"To improve your grades, actively listen and take handwritten notes during class, ask questions, utilize your teacher and resources such as the syllabus, maintain focus through proper nutrition, and adapt study methods to your learning style."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sam meets with Carlo (Renato Romano) who gives him a check for his most recent gig. But after two years of not writing anything, Sam is practically broke. He tells Carlos that he plans to leave Italy and return to the USA with Julia. On his way home that night, Sam passes a small art gallery where he witnesses the attack of a woman (Eva Renzi) by a mysterious black-gloved assailant dressed in a raincoat. Attempting to reach her, Sam is trapped between two mechanically-operated glass doors and can only watch as the villain makes his escape after stabing the woman.Eventually the police arrive and Sam discusses what he saw to Inspector Morosini (Enrico Maria Salerno). Sam says that he knows where was something odd about the scene, but he cannot place what's wrong about it. The police take Sam to the police station where they interrogate him all night. In the morning, Sam is permitted to leave, but Morosini takes his passport because he considers Sam an important witness and must not leave Italy. Morosini tells Sam that they have been three unresolved murders and that a \\"dangerous maniac\\" is loose in Rome. Sam phones the airport to cancel his airplane reservation and heads back to his apartment. On his way back, someone swings a meat cleaver at his head, but an elderly woman on the street warns him just in time. The black raincoat killer flees before Sam can identify him.Later that day, Sam goes back to the police station to report his attack and he is told that a black-leather glove was found at the crime scene and has been analyzed. Apparently, the attacker was left-handed and a smoker. Sam goes to the hospital to visit the woman who was attacked...

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.  and the situation: Both Nicaragua and Costa Rica had large tract of pristine forests.

Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr. (March 21, 1902 - October 19, 1988) was an American delta blues singer and guitarist, noted for his highly emotional style of singing and slide guitar playing. After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records. In 1927, at the age of 25, House underwent a change of musical perspective as rapid and dramatic as a religious conversion. In a hamlet south of Clarksdale, he heard one of his drinking companions, either James McCoy or Willie Wilson (his recollections differed), playing bottleneck guitar, a style he had never heard before. He immediately changed his attitude about the blues, bought a guitar from a musician called Frank Hoskins, and within weeks was playing with Hoskins, McCoy and Wilson. Two songs he learned from McCoy would later be among his best known: \\"My Black Mama\\" and \\"Preachin' the Blues\\". Another source of inspiration was Rube Lacey, a much better known performer who had recorded for Columbia Records in 1927 (no titles were released) and for Paramount Records in 1928 (two titles were released). In an astonishingly short time, with only these four musicians as models, House developed to a professional standard a blues style based on his religious singing and simple bottleneck guitar style.  Around 1927 or 1928, he had been playing in a juke joint when a man went on a shooting spree, wounding House in the leg, and he allegedly shot the man dead. House received a 15-year sentence at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman Farm), of which he served two years between 1928 and 1929. He credited his re-examination and release to an appeal by his family, but also spoke of the intervention by the influential white planter for whom they worked. The date of the killing and the duration of his sentence are unclear; House gave different accounts to different interviewers, and searches by his biographer Daniel Beaumont found no details in the court records of Coahoma County or in the archive of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.  Upon his release in 1929 or early 1930, House was strongly advised to leave Clarksdale and stay away. He walked to Jonestown and caught a train to the small town of Lula, Mississippi, sixteen miles north of Clarksdale and eight miles from the blues hub of Helena, Arkansas. Coincidentally, the great star of Delta blues, Charley Patton, was also in virtual exile in Lula, having been expelled from his base on the Dockery Plantation. With his partner Willie Brown, Patton dominated the local market for professional blues performance. Patton watched House busking when he arrived penniless at Lula station, but did not approach him. He observed House's showmanship attracting a crowd to the cafe and bootleg whiskey business of a woman called Sara Knight. Patton invited House to be a regular musical partner with him and Brown. House formed a liaison with Knight, and both musicians profited from association with her bootlegging activities. The musical partnership is disputed by Patton's biographers Stephen Calt and Gayle Dean Wardlow. They consider that House's musicianship was too limited to play with Patton and Brown, who were also rumoured to be estranged at the time. They also cite one statement by House that he did not play for dances in Lula. Beaumont concluded that House became a friend of Patton's, traveling with him to gigs but playing separately.","output":"This text is about Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr., an American delta blues singer and guitarist.

Unfortunately, my experience using these headphones has been overwhelmingly negative. The most glaring issue is the audio quality. Despite the manufacturer claiming to have premium sound quality, the music playback is muddled and lacks clarity, making it difficult to enjoy my favorite songs. In addition to the poor audio, the battery life is significantly shorter than advertised. The headphones barely last 4 hours on a full charge, rather than the promised 8 hours. Furthermore, the headphones repeatedly disconnect from my device, forcing me to go through the pairing process multiple times a day. I also find them to be uncomfortable to wear for extended periods, which only adds to the disappointment. It would be great if the manufacturer could improve their product by delivering on their audio quality claims, improving battery life, and ensuring a stable connection. In conclusion, I cannot recommend the XYZ Bluetooth Headphones, as they have proven to be a frustrating and disappointing investment.

For conspiracy theorists, it had been yet more proof of the existence of a sinister Government agency tracking their every move. But now a claim that hackers had managed to penetrate a top secret dossier used by FBI agents to spy on Apple users appears to have been proven unfounded. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had been the centre of a major privacy row after cyber experts from The AntiSec hacking group released more than a million Apple device IDs - allegedly taken from an agent's laptop. Hackers claimed to have obtained more than 12 million ID codes Apple uses to identify its gadgets from an FBI agent's laptop. The group claimed the information - which included 12 million IDs, known as Unique Device Identifiers, as well as personal information such as user names,. device names, notification tokens, cell phone numbers and addresses - enabled the Government to spy on the users. The FBI immediately denied it was the source - but many refused to believe it was anything other than affirmation of their Orwellian nightmares. However, a boss of a small publishing. agency has come forward to say his firm was the most likely source of. the information - not a murky, malign Government agency. Paul DeHart, CEO of the Blue Toad,. which provides app building services to 6,000 users and serves. 100million page views a month, told NBC News technicians had matched. the hacked information with their own private data.

He added: 'As soon as we found out we. were involved and victimised, we approached the appropriate law. enforcement officials, and we began to take steps to come forward, clear. the record and take responsibility for this.' AntiSec last week released a million of unique IDs online - but removed the most personal data. The hackers issued a statement saying: 'During the second week of March 2012, a Dell Vostro notebook, used by Supervisor Special Agent Christopher K.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We have: 224 = -1088*j + 1056*j First, notice that both terms on the right side of the equation have a \\"j\\" in them. We can combine them by adding them together.  -1088*j means we have -1088 j's, and 1056*j means we have 1056 j's. If we add both amounts together, we will end up with: (-1088 + 1056) * j Doing the math inside the parentheses, we find: -1088 + 1056 = -32 So, now our equation looks like: 224 = -32 * j Now, we need to find out what number \\"j\\" is. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -32 to isolate \\"j\\" on one side. 224 / -32 = (-32 * j) / -32 Calculating both sides, we get: -7 = j So, the answer is: j = -7 There you go!

And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that.

She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes. Thomas Anderson is a computer programmer living a double life under the hacker alias \\"Neo\\". He believes something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the cryptic phrase \\"the Matrix\\". Trinity contacts him, saying that a man named Morpheus can explain its meaning; however, the Agents, led by Agent Smith, apprehend Neo at his office. Undeterred, Neo meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between a red pill that will allow him to learn the truth about the Matrix, and a blue pill that will return him to his old life. Swallowing the red pill, Neo's reality disintegrates and he awakens, naked and weak, in a liquid-filled pod, finding himself one of countless people connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued and brought aboard Morpheus's hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar. Morpheus explains that, in the 21st century, humans waged a war against intelligent machines that they had created. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines began to harvest the humans' bioelectricity for power. The Matrix is a shared simulation of the world as it was in 1999 in which the minds of the harvested humans are trapped and pacified; Neo has been living in it since birth. Morpheus and his crew belong to a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix and \\"unplug\\" enslaved humans, recruiting them as rebels. The rebels' understanding of the true nature of the simulated reality allows them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities.

Summarize the following: Warm or hot water can be very helpful for relieving many symptoms of sickness. It can loosen mucus in the nose, clear the head, relieve congestion and soothe tense muscles.  Your bath or shower water should be between 36 and 40°C (or 95 to 105°F) to minimize the risk of burning your skin. Check the temperature with a thermometer or simply adjust the temperature on your water heater.  Breathe in the steam from the water. Add Epsom salts or an aromatherapy oil such as eucalyptus or peppermint to the water. Either product can have a sedative effect and also open up stuffed nasal passages and your head.  Consider keeping a humidifier near you to help keep your head clear of congestion throughout the day. Rinsing your throat with saltwater can relieve a sore and scratchy throat. This remedy can relieve inflammation and may make it easier to swallow and talk.  Mix 1/2 a teaspoon of salt into an 8-oz glass of warm water to make saltwater. Rinse with a mouthful of the solution for 30 seconds. You can do this as often as necessary. You may not have any choice but to go to work or school, or even just stay home. Reducing your workload by eliminating strenuous tasks can help you get much needed rest as well as relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort.  Take it easy wherever you can. For example, try and reschedule meetings or don’t participate in gym class. If you work at home, leave strenuous work such as the laundry or cleaning until you feel better. Decreasing and shifting your workload can be especially important if you are taking medications that make you foggy or drowsy. Stay away from exercise until you feel better. This may give you enough energy to get through the day. If you are feeling too sick to get through your day, call in sick to work or school. This may help you feel better more quickly while minimizing the risk that you spread any illness to colleagues.  Be honest with your superiors about why you are not coming. For example, “I’m suffering from terrible congestion and a very bad headache. It makes it difficult to concentrate.” This is a good option if you work at a job such as construction where you cannot do less strenuous activity until you feel better.  If you work with children, the elderly, or people with weakened or compromised immune systems, or if you work with food, you absolutely should not go to work when sick. Ensuring that you are properly hydrated can replace fluids you lose as a result of being sick. This may help relieve your symptoms so that you feel well enough to push through the day.  Drink at least nine cups of water for proper hydration if you are a woman and 13 cups if you are a man.  Drink clear liquids such as water, juice, clear broth, or non-caffeinated soft drinks. Steer clear of caffeinated beverages such as coffee, black teas, and soft drinks. They could dehydrate you and exacerbate your symptoms. Several studies have shown eating chicken soup can relieve the symptoms of a cold or other illness. Having some chicken soup can help keep you hydrated as well as minimizing your symptoms. There are many options for chicken soups including tasty chicken noodle soup. Chicken soup possesses anti-inflammatory properties. It can also help increase the movement of mucus through the nose, which can alleviate congestion and other symptoms. The BRAT diet, which stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast is low in fiber and easy to digest. It can help ease an upset stomach and replace nutrients.  You can also eat crackers, boiled potatoes, and gelatin to help soothe an upset stomach.  Add more complex foods such as cereal, fruits, and vegetables once you are able to keep down BRAT foods and chicken soup.  Be gentle on your stomach, especially if you’re nauseous, vomiting, or have diarrhea. Dairy, fatty or fried foods, or spicy dishes may exacerbate your symptoms. Alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco products can exacerbate the symptoms of a cold. Avoiding these products while you are sick may make you feel better and reduce the duration of your symptoms. Ensuring that you’re getting sufficient rest is an important part of feeling well enough to get through your day. You can take naps or even just sit quietly to give your body rest.  Take naps during the day and get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. Both an make it much easier to get through the day if you’re sick. Sleep in a space that is comfortable, warm, and slightly humid. Use a vaporizer or cool-mist humidifier keep the air moist and help alleviate congestion and coughing. Allow a fan to circulate air. You can also open a window if it is not cold outside. If your symptoms persist and resting doesn’t make you able to function through the day, schedule an appointment with the doctor. She can treat your symptoms and may give you medication that can help you function enough to make it through any day.","output":"Hot water can help in relieving symptoms of sickness and should be used at a safe temperature of 36-40°C (95-105°F).

For sore and scratchy throats, a saltwater rinse can be beneficial.  Reducing and delegating strenuous tasks can help in managing discomfort and rest can alleviate symptoms, especially if medication is causing drowsiness. If the illness is severe, it's advisable to take time off, especially if it might result in spreading the disease in vulnerable environments like schools or food establishments.

Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entrée en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo...  Guess a valid title for it!

Some parts of the soundtrack , composed by Francesco De Masi , are featured in the videogame Red Dead Revolver .  - Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western (primarily in Japan), is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success. The term was used by American critics and other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.  - Sergio Leone (3 January 1929  30 April 1989) was an Italian film director, producer and screenwriter, credited as the inventor of the \\"Spaghetti Western\\" genre.  - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a 1966 Italian epic Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone, starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach in the title roles respectively. The screenplay was written by Age & Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, and Leone (with additional screenplay material and dialogue provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati), based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. This conclusion can be reached by breaking down the premise and hypothesis, and analyzing their relationship. The premise states that \\"fraud is very difficult to prove.\\" This implies that establishing the guilt of someone committing fraud can be a challenging task. This difficulty may arise from various factors, such as the complexity of the fraud scheme, the collaboration of multiple parties, or the concealment of relevant evidence. The premise essentially highlights the general challenge of obtaining substantial proof in fraud cases. The hypothesis, \\"It's not easy to show when people commit fraud,\\" is fundamentally a reiteration of the premise. It maintains the same idea that proving fraud is difficult. The hypothesis emphasizes the challenge of demonstrating when a person commits the criminal act. This difficulty may stem from the same factors mentioned earlier, indicating that the underlying reasons for why proving fraud is difficult have not changed. In essence, the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise, upholding the notion of fraud being challenging to prove. Both the premise and the hypothesis focus on the difficulties faced when attempting to demonstrate the occurrence of fraud and the individuals involved. Therefore, if the premise is true, it can be reasonably concluded that the hypothesis is true as well.

Answer:","output":"The Japanese boat \\"Tomozuru\\" participated in the conquest known as the \\"Southern Operation\\" from 1941 to 1942. The Southern Operation was a series of campaigns by the Empire of Japan to expand its territories across Southeast Asia and the Pacific during World War II. The \\"Tomozuru\\" was a Tomozuru-class torpedo boat, commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1938. As part of the Empire's 11th Torpedo Boat Division, the \\"Tomozuru\\" was assigned to support Japan's military operations in the region. The Southern Operation encompassed several key sub-campaigns during the larger Pacific campaign of World War II, including: 1. The invasion of the Philippines: Starting in December 1941, the Japanese forces invaded the Philippines, a strategic United States territory in the Pacific. Japan's successful capture of the Philippines weakened the US's foothold in the region, ultimately leading to the forced surrender of Filipino and American forces in May 1942. 2. The invasion of Malaya and Singapore: Concurrently with the Philippines invasion, Japanese forces also launched a successful campaign against British Malaya and Singapore, beginning in December 1941. The fall of Singapore in February 1942 was a severe blow to British imperial prestige in the region. 3. The Dutch East Indies Campaign: Japan targeted the resource-rich Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) to secure vital resources such as oil, rubber, and tin, which were crucial for its wartime efforts. In January 1942, Japanese forces began their invasion, encountering Allied resistance primarily from Dutch, British, Australian, and American forces. By March 1942, Japan had successfully captured the Dutch East Indies. 4. The Battle of Burma: In early 1942, Japanese forces launched an invasion of Burma (present-day Myanmar), with the intent of severing supply lines between British India and China. Japan successfully occupied Burma throughout the war until 1945, when it was finally recaptured by British and Indian forces. 5. The battles in the Pacific and Indian Oceans: During this time period, Japan also sought to expand its naval dominance across the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Key engagements included the Battle of the Java Sea in February 1942, the Doolittle Raid in April 1942, and the Indian Ocean Raid. Throughout the Southern Operation, the \\"Tomozuru\\" played a supporting role, particularly in the maritime engagements across the region. As a torpedo boat, it was tasked with patrolling, providing support for major combat vessels, and conducting small-scale raids against enemy ships. The Southern Operation's initial success enabled Japan to establish a vast empire across Southeast Asia and the Pacific by mid-1942. However, this rapid expansion drew the United States further into the conflict, ultimately leading to Japan's eventual defeat in World War II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.

Britain's richest 1% own as much as poorest 55% of population Houses along Kensington Palace Gardens in London, Britain's most expensive street. Oxfam recently reported that five billionaire families controlled the same wealth as 20% of the population. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images Britain's richest 1% have accumulated as much wealth as the poorest 55% of the population put together, according to the latest official analysis of who owns the nation's £9.5tn of property, pensions and financial assets. In figures that also lay bare the extent of inequality across the north-south divide, the Office for National Statistics said household wealth in the south-east had been rising five times as fast as across the whole country. The average wealth of households in the southeast had surged to £309,000 at the end of 2012, up 30% since the first wealth report published by the ONS covering 2006-8 – while the average rise in England was only 6%. But wealth in the north-east had fallen, the only region where it did so, to an average of just under £143,000. In Scotland the figure was £165,500. The data also shows that one in nine households have second homes or rental properties and one in 14 sport a personalised number plate on their car. Northern regions lost out after a dramatic rise in stock market values that was grabbed mostly by households in the south east, the ONS figures show. The situation is likely to have worsened following an 18% surge in house prices over the past year in the south-east and even higher at the top end of the market. A rush to save among richer households as the recession deepened boosted the nation's total wealth and ensured Britain's long-established financial inequality remained in place, with the top 10% laying claim to 44% of household wealth – while the poorest half of the country had only 9%. Rachael Orr, Oxfam's head of poverty in the UK said the figures were a \\"shocking chapter in a tale of two Britains\\". The charity recently reported that five billionaire families controlled the same wealth as 20% of the population. \\"It is further evidence of increasing inequality at a time when five rich families have the same wealth as 12 million people,\\" she said. \\"We need our politicians to grasp the nettle and make the narrowing gap between the richest and poorest a top priority. It cannot be right that in Britain today a small elite are getting richer and richer while millions are struggling to make ends meet.\\" Duncan Exley, director of the Equality Trust, said: \\"The grotesque concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny minority is fracturing our society, weakening our economy and giving disproportionate power to the richest. Unless policymakers adopt a clear goal of reducing the gap between the richest and the rest, they will have to govern an increasingly dysfunctional nation.\\"The report comes after French economist Thomas Piketty has ignited international debate about inequality by documenting the rapid accumulation of assets by the top 1% over the four decades since the 1970s. Britain's top 1% saw their share of wealth increase slightly in the four years before 2012, grabbing the same share as 54.9% of the population, up from 54.2% in 2008/10. But the Treasury said the report showed that wealth inequality had remained the same throughout the six years up to 2012 while income inequality had declined to levels last seen in 1986. A spokesperson said the government's efforts to protect the poorest during the recession had worked. \\"The effects of the Great Recession are still being felt which is why we have taken continued action to help hardworking people by cutting income tax and freezing fuel duty. \\"And we want to help more people to save for their future or own their own home which is why we are giving people more flexibility over their pensions and introducing Help to Buy. At the same time we have introduced new higher rates of stamp duty on the most expensive homes and done more than any previous government to crack down on tax evasion and avoidance in order to ensure that everyone pays their fair share in tax.\\" Critics of the wealth report said it failed to capture the huge diversion of wealth to offshore tax havens, which account for trillions of pounds worth of savings. A series of investigations into offshore tax havens have documented the success of their banks in attracting a steady rise in the savings and financial assets of the richest 1%. There was also a clear disparity between women and men over who owns the most homes, pensions, cars and stocks and shares. The average value of men's total pension wealth was nearly twice as high as women's in 2010/12 – £63,000 compared with £34,800. The power of the grey pound is highlighted in the report by several measures, including one showing that couples without children, where one person is over and the other under the state pension age, have the highest total wealth at £607,800, up from £452,000 in 2006.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Question: He was scared of skiing after the accident, what did he want to avoid in general? Options: - broken spirit - healthy body - broken bones - cold nose - broken legs  Explain why a human would choose \\"broken bones\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"broken bones\\" as the answer to the question above due to several reasons that are closely related to the context provided and the human ability to anticipate, empathize, and learn from experiences. Firstly, we are informed that the person was scared of skiing after the accident. This implies that the individual experienced a traumatic event, which led to a negative emotional response. The fact that the person became scared after the accident suggests that the accident resulted in serious consequences, likely involving physical harm or pain. Thus, \\"broken bones\\" is a logical answer because it is associated with severe injury and pain, which would be something a person would want to avoid after experiencing such an event. Another reason why a human would choose \\"broken bones\\" over the other options is that it directly relates to the consequences of a skiing accident, potentially in which limbs and joints are subjected to extreme forces and impact. Skiing accidents carry a higher risk of broken bones due to the intensity and speed of the sport. Hence, it is a reasonable choice out of the available options considering the context of the question. Furthermore, humans are capable of understanding and empathizing with the pain and fear associated with broken bones. From an early age, we learn that injuries like broken bones can take time to heal and may require invasive medical procedures or a long recovery process. This knowledge can evoke a stronger emotional response, leading to a heightened desire to avoid such an outcome. Among the other options: - \\"Broken spirit\\" might seem like a reasonable choice considering the individual became scared after the accident. However, it is a more figurative expression rather than something tangible. In this case, a human would likely choose something more closely related to the physical aspect of the accident. - \\"Healthy body\\" contradicts the situation described, as a person avoiding skiing seeks to avoid harm and potential injury rather than maintaining a healthy body. - \\"Cold nose\\" is a minor discomfort, not indicating significant harm, compared to more severe consequences like broken bones, making it less practical to answer the question. - \\"Broken legs\\" might be considered as a potential answer, but \\"broken bones\\" is a more inclusive option, encompassing all possible bone fractures, including the legs. Therefore, a human would likely choose the more general answer. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"broken bones\\" as the answer since it represents a tangible and direct consequence of a skiing accident, takes into account the fear and pain associated with such an injury, and generally best explains the situation described in the context. This choice reflects the human ability to relate personal experiences, anticipate negative outcomes, and empathize with or learn from the emotions and pain of others."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Very disappointed....

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: US law enforcement authorities are investigating plans by members of the hacking collective Anonymous to disrupt activities at the Marine Corps base in Quantico to protest against the alleged rough treatment given suspected WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning.      Anonymous gained wide attention last year with attacks on the websites of PayPal and other businesses that had stopped processing donations to anti-secrecy site WikiLeaks as it published thousands of secret US state department cables.      Recently, Anonymous members appear to have broadened their targets by suggesting attacks on the US military. On publicly accessible document-sharing sites, they have been discussing plans to target the brig in Quantico, Virginia, where Private Manning is being held under what his attorney said were unjustifiable conditions.      One collaborative document states the “purpose” of the contemplated operation is to “harass staff at MCB Quantico Brig to the point of frustration”. The “plan” is described as a “complete communications shutdown” of the facilities’ internet pages and phone links.      A Quantico spokesman, Lieutenant Agustin Solivan, said officials had referred the matter to law enforcement and counter-intelligence agencies. “We are aware of the threat and any threats to defence department information systems and networks are taken seriously,” he said. “The intent or stating that you are going to commit a crime is a crime in itself,” he added.      Barrett Brown, who has been helping with the plans under his real name, said he was not alarmed about the prospect of prosecution. “My feeling is I’m going down anyway so I may as well do it with gusto.”      Members of Anonymous identify with WikiLeaks and see themselves as crusaders for the free flow of information. But while WikiLeaks has merely published classified material, as have mainstream media organisations, Anonymous has become steadily more aggressive.      First it went after businesses with “denial-of-service” attacks, in which computers bombard websites until they can’t handle the load and become unavailable to the public. That brought some 40 law enforcement searches in the US and a handful or arrests in other countries.      Anonymous became more brazen last month, hacking into a US security firm that had boasted to the Financial Times of infiltrating the online group and identifying many of its leaders. Anonymous distributed thousands of internal e-mails from the company, HBGary Federal, among other things showing that HBGary Federal and two allied businesses had proposed planting fake documents on WikiLeaks to discredit that site. ||||| A leader of the computer hackers group known as Anonymous is threatening new attacks on major U.S. corporations and government officials as part of at an escalating “cyberwar” against the citadels of American power.      “It’s a guerrilla cyberwar — that’s what I call it,” said Barrett Brown, 29, who calls himself a senior strategist and “propagandist” for Anonymous. He added: “It’s sort of an unconventional, asymmetrical act of warfare that we’ve involved in. And we didn’t necessarily start it. I mean, this fire has been burning.”      A defiant and cocky 29-year-old college dropout, Brown was cavalier about accusations that the group is violating federal laws. He insisted that Anonymous members are only policing corporate and governmental wrongdoing — as its members define it.      Breaking laws, but 'ethically'      “Our people break laws, just like all people break laws,” he added. “When we break laws, we do it in the service of civil disobedience. We do so ethically. We do it against targets that have asked for it.”      And those targets are apparently only growing in number. Angered over the treatment of Bradley Manning, the Army private who is accused of leaking classified U.S. government documents to WikiLeaks and who is currently being held in solitary confinement at a military brig in Quantico, Va., Brown says the group is planning new computer attacks targeting government officials involved in his case.      Read more reporting by Michael Isikoff in 'The Isikoff Files'      Among the methods the group is vowing to use: posting personal information about the officials on the Internet, a method known as “doxing.” The group also this week issued a threat over the Internet to “harass” the staff at Quantico “to the point of frustration,” including a “complete communications shutdown” of its Internet and phone links.      In recent months, Anonymous — a loose collection of tech-savvy hackers or “hacktivists” — has threatened some of the biggest corporations in the country. The group is also the target of a major FBI investigation that has included dozens of subpoenas and raids on the homes of suspected members.      (In the interview, Brown, a sometimes freelance journalist, said he is not personally involved in hacking computers, stressing that he only advises the group, participates in its internal strategy sessions and serves as its spokesman. An FBI spokeswoman on Tuesday described the bureau’s investigation of Anonymous members as “ongoing,” but declined further comment.)      Anonymous has been blamed by senior U.S. government officials — including Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn — with mounting so-called “distributed denial of service” (DDoS) attacks on major corporate and government targets. The group is believed to do this by mobilizing thousands of so-called “zombie” computers, which have been infected with viruses, and directing them to flood a targeted website simultaneously, creating such a huge demand for service that the site shuts down.      Champion of WikiLeaks, Mideast protesters      Anonymous is believed to have used this method in December, when it took credit for crashing the websites of MasterCard and Visa in retaliation for their decision to cut off service to WikiLeaks. It also claimed credit for shutting down government websites in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, which it thereby helping to stoke the uprising in those countries.      Last month, the hackers group launched what may have been its most audacious attack to date, aiming its guns on HBGary Federal, a major cybersecurity firm and government contractor. After HBGary Federal’s CEO threatened to expose members of Anonymous, the group struck back — breaking into the cybersecurity firm’s computers, hijacking the CEO’s Twitter account and swiping tens of thousands of embarrassing emails that it later posted on the Internet.      Related coverage: Do WikiLeaks imitators put your e-mail at risk?      The emails appeared to show that HBGary Federal and two other contractors were proposing a “disinformation campaign” aimed at discrediting political allies of WikiLeaks and critics of the Bank of American and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, prompting a group of House Democrats to call for a congressional investigation into the contractors.      Asked about Anonymous, Greg Hoglund, the CEO of HBGary, the founder of HBGary Federal, said Tuesday: “These are not hacktivists. They are criminals. They are breaking into computer systems and stealing information — and that violates multiple federal statutes.”      In the first network television interview he has given, Brown – who has been widely quoted as one of the group’s spokesmen — invited NBC to his walk up, one-room Dallas apartment and allowed a reporter to observe as he and what he said were other Anonymous members communicated in a secure chat room.      Their goal that day: drafting a threatening letter to PayPal, the online processing firm owned by eBay, in response to news that the firm had restricted service to Manning’s legal defense fund.      Threatening PayPal      “We politely ask you to finally stand up and show some backbone,” said Brown, reading from the letter on his small laptop. “Unfreeze the account, or release the funds, so Bradley Manning and his lawyers can access it. Otherwise you prove you are nothing but a puppet of a criminal government, which is violating the Geneva Convention and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.”      And then, said Brown: “As always, it ends…We are Anonymous. We do not forgive. We do not forget.”      “That’s our little motto,” he added.      There is still much about Anonymous that remains obscure -- and which Brown would not reveal. As he tells it, the group has thousands, if not tens of thousands, of participants, including, he claims, computer managers at major corporations and government agencies and journalists. But, he says, the group’s activities are governed, or at least shaped, by a much smaller group of a “couple dozen” people that reacts to the “ebb and flow” of events. Their overarching goal, he said, “information freedom.”      But there is little doubt that they are capable of brutal actions. Hoglund, the HBGary CEO, said that as part of their attack on his corporate affiliate HBGary Federal, Anonymous members collected personal information on company employees, including Social Security numbers, home addresses and the names of their children. Some employees received death threats, he said.      “Anonymous is not what people think,” he added. “They are vicious individuals and they are having the time of their lives because of all the press they are receiving.”      No apologies for tough tactics      Brown, for his part, makes no bones about the fact that Anonymous plays rough.      Asked about the group’s capabilities, he said, “Well, they keep increasing, but I can tell you that our capabilities are such that, we can, for instance, go into the servers of a federal contracting company … take those servers down, delete backups, take all internal emails, take documents, shut down the websites of the owners of those companies, take everything from those websites, ruin the lives of people who have done it wrong … harass them, make sure they’ll never work again in this particular industry. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A group called Anonymous, which is made up of computer hackers, is planning to disrupt a Marine Corps base to protest against the treatment of a man named Bradley Manning.

Answer:","output":"Guy Rodgers, an American professional basketball player, played alongside Wilt Chamberlain, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA) later in his career. However, Rodgers himself did not play for the Los Angeles Lakers. Instead, he played for the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Chicago Bulls, among others.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korea is looking into developing and financing economic projects with North Korea that could take effect if a nuclear deal is reached with the United States. South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said on Wednesday the government was “internally carrying out preparations” to organize, finance and implement possible inter-Korea projects. But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement. North Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country’s external trade. Seeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. But easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North’s denuclearization promises. “Once the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,” said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program. South Korea, however, is considering a range of economic incentives to encourage Kim to follow through on a nuclear deal with Trump. But these investments are prohibited by the U.N. sanctions and would require a Security Council exemption to proceed. At the recent...

However, it's important to note that there have been multiple rounds of sanctions imposed on North Korea by the United Nations Security Council, starting in 2006 in response to the country's nuclear weapons and missile tests. Some of the factors contributing to the sanctions include: - North Korea's missile testing - Kim Jong Un's reluctance to dismantle the nuclear arsenal - Provocative acts by North Korea, which exacerbate tensions in the region It is also mentioned that the sanctions have intensified over the last two years, prior to President Trump attending the summit and the recent diplomatic engagements between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Quick and the Dead Movie plot: Duncan McKaskel (Tom Conti) and his wife, Susanna (Kate Capshaw), a married couple who, along with their 12-year-old son, Tom (Kenny Morrison), are travelling West hoping to start a new life. They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times.

Let's first look at the problem: 166 * o + 264 * o - 6450 = 0 Now, to make it easier, we can combine stuff that is alike. If you have 166 circles and 264 more circles, how many circles do you have? You simply add them together, like this: (166 + 264) * o - 6450 = 0 If we add the numbers, we get 430 circles: 430 * o - 6450 = 0 Now, we want to find how many times we need to multiply these circles to fill up a space of 6450. This means we need to get the circles' value alone, or as we say, \\"solve for o.\\" To do that, we'll add 6450 to both sides of the equation: 430 * o = 6450 Now, to find the value of each circle (or \\"o\\"), we should take the total value (6450) and divide it by the number of circles (430): o = 6450 / 430 If we do the division, we find out that each circle (or \\"o\\") has a value of 15: o = 15 So, the solution to the problem is o = 15.

Answer the question...who won the arms race in the cold war??","output":"The arms race during the Cold War was a period of intense competition, primarily between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR), along with their respective allies. This race focused on the development, production, and deployment of advanced military technology and weaponry, including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. It lasted roughly from the mid-1940s to the early 1990s, with other minor competing powers such as the United Kingdom, France, and China involved, albeit on a smaller scale. The arms race played a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of the Cold War. Although it is not accurate to declare a clear-cut winner in this competition, as the arms race gradually deescalated without a conventional military confrontation, it is widely accepted that the US and its allies emerged in a stronger position when the Cold War ended. Several factors contributed to this assessment of the US as the more successful party in the arms race: 1. Economic Strength: Throughout the arms race, the US maintained a stronger economy compared to the USSR. The American free-market capitalist system enabled rapid economic growth, technological innovation, and better living standards for its population. On the other hand, the centrally planned economy in the USSR faced chronic inefficiencies, reduced incentives for innovation, and limited consumer goods. As a result, the US was able to sustain its military spending and development without severely compromising its citizens' well-being, while the burden of the arms race on the USSR ultimately contributed to its economic weakness. 2. Technological Advantages: The US generally maintained an edge in technological innovations during the arms race. It was the first country to develop nuclear weapons, as demonstrated by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The US kept advancing its atomic weapons arsenal and eventually developed the more potent hydrogen bomb. Also, significant advances in areas like missile systems, surveillance, stealth technology, and computing capabilities gave the US a competitive advantage over the Soviet military-industrial complex. 3. Strategic Initiatives: Throughout the Cold War, the US and NATO successfully implemented various strategic initiatives aimed at undermining the USSR's efforts in the arms race. The strategy of containment sought to limit the expansion of communism globally, thereby restricting Soviet influence and military presence. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan launched the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a missile defense system designed to protect the US from potential Soviet nuclear attacks. While never fully implemented, SDI forced the Soviet Union to increase its military spending, exacerbating its economic problems. 4. Collapse of the Soviet Union: The eventual disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War and the arms race. The economic hardship faced by the USSR, coupled with growing internal dissent and crumbling political institutions, led the Soviet Union to loosen its grip on Eastern European countries, eventually resulting in the peaceful dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. The US effectively emerged as the sole superpower, reflecting a relative victory in the arms race. In conclusion, while the arms race during the Cold War was characterized by numerous fluctuations and periods of advantage and disadvantage for both the US and the USSR, the United States and its allies are generally regarded as having emerged in a stronger position following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The combination of economic strength, technological advantages, strategic initiatives, and the ultimate fate of the USSR contributed to this assessment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: After a major defeat, what does Brighton advise Faisal to do? Movie title: Lawrence of Arabia Movie plot: The film is presented in two parts, divided by an intermission. Part I[edit] The film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him. The story then moves backward to the First World War, where Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant, notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of General Murray, Mr. Dryden of the Arab Bureau sends him to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal in his revolt against the Turks. On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest. Brighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasimâand Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear. Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi, the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a blood feud. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please answer a question about the following article about Gymnastics: A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single leg and double leg work. Single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, an element often done on the pommels. Double leg work however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the exercise more challenging, gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their legs (Flares). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse, or landing after a handstand. This requires back muscles to do any sort of skill. From handstands being easy to back or front flips being a little difficult.

In 2007 and 2008, Mongolia experienced high growth rates of 9.9% and 8.9% respectively, primarily driven by the mining sector. However, the global financial crisis and a significant drop in commodity prices in 2009 negatively impacted the country's economy, causing the local currency to lose 40% of its value against the U.S. dollar and leading to the receivership of two out of 16 commercial banks. Despite setbacks, in 2011, Mongolia's GDP growth rebounded and was expected to reach 16.4%. However, this growth was accompanied by high inflation rates, averaging 12.6% at the end of 2011, which offset some of the increases in GDP. While Mongolia's GDP rose consistently since 2002 at a rate of 7.5%, according to a 2006 official estimate, the country continued to struggle with a significant trade deficit. The Economist predicted that the trade deficit, equivalent to 14% of Mongolia's GDP, would transform into a surplus in 2013. This projection suggests an eventual improvement in the country's economic situation as a result of the growing mining sector and potential for increased exports.

At the time, John Lennon was collaborating with several prominent artists, and his friendship with David Bowie resulted in this iconic hit. The song arose from a loose and improvisational session, with Lennon and Bowie feeding off each other's ideas. The creative process and collaboration began at New York's Electric Lady Studios, where Bowie was working on mixing his \\"Young Americans\\" album. During these sessions, Carlos Alomar, a well-respected guitarist, came up with the catchy guitar riff that became the backbone of the song \\"Fame.\\" Alomar had joined Bowie's backing band in 1974 and went on to work with him extensively throughout his career. It is worth noting that the song's title \\"Fame\\" is said to have arisen from a conversation between Bowie and Lennon about the perils of celebrity and how it can negatively impact an artist's life. The outcome of this collaboration resulted in a song that fused elements of funk, soul, and rock, showcasing a departure from Bowie's previous glam rock sound. The song displays a groove-oriented rhythm, and the soulful backing vocals provided by Lennon and Bowie gave it an added depth and texture. \\"Fame\\" became a hit, reaching No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in September 1975.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus? , can you please find it?   The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial.

A University of Pittsburgh research professor accused of killing his wife with a lethal dose of cyanide pleaded not guilty Tuesday, according to Mike Manko, spokesman for the Allegheny County District Attorney's office. Robert Ferrante was extradited from West Virginia to Allegheny County Jail in Pennsylvania on Tuesday morning, where he later appeared via video conference at his arraignment, according to the Allegheny County district attorney's office. The arraignment lasted only five minutes. Ferrante pleaded not guilty in the death of his wife, Autumn Klein, 41, former head of women's neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, according to the district attorney's office. Several preliminary hearing dates have been set for early next month regarding the custody of Ferrante and Klein's 6-year-old daughter, Cianna, who is in the care of her maternal grandparents, the district attorney's office said. Hearings have also been set regarding Ferrante's assets. Before his arrest on July 25, Ferrante was a researcher and professor of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh. Part of his job included managing a laboratory where he conducted clinical trials using various drugs and chemicals, according to a criminal complaint. Several text messages sent between the couple before Klein's death in April suggest that Ferrante urged Klein to try using creatine to get help her get pregnant, according to the complaint. CNN Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen reports that some people use creatine to build up muscle and may have some medicinal value, but that there is no connection between increased fertility and creatine use. A source close to the case told CNN: \\"One of the theories the prosecution will work off of is that the cyanide was mixed with the creatine that Ferrante was urging his wife to take.\\" One day before Klein fell ill, Ferrante had used his University of Pittsburgh credit card to place an overnight order for more than a half a pound of cyanide. At the time the order was placed, there were no active projects at Ferrante's lab that involved the use of cyanide, according to the complaint. Cyanide is a naturally occurring toxic substance that can be found in seeds of various plants. It is widely distributed throughout research laboratories as a chemical used in scientific experiments. Cyanide interferes with the ability of the body to use oxygen to produce energy, which can lead to rapid death. \\"Cyanide in low doses will make you dizzy, you'll start breathing rapidly, but if you get it in big doses, it can actually make you stop breathing and that's what kills you,\\" Cohen said. On April 17, Allegheny County 911 dispatch received a call from Ferrante requesting medical assistance for his wife, who he said was possibly having a stroke, the complaint read. He described her condition as \\"conscious and breathing, but not alert.\\" When paramedics arrived, they found Klein on the floor of the kitchen with a plastic bag containing creatine. Klein died on April 20. In a statement made to detectives shortly after being informed of Klein's death because of cyanide poisoning, Ferrante said, \\"Why would she do that to herself? Who would do this to her?\\" according to the complaint. A neighbor of the couple told CNN on Tuesday that nothing seemed amiss to her. \\"I've never seen anything to suggest they were anything but a happy couple with a beautiful little girl,\\" Blithe Runsdorf said. She said the family had just gotten back from a trip to Puerto Rico and that they had never seemed happier. Runsdorf added that after his wife's death, Ferrante \\"acted like a guy who had everything pulled out from under him.\\" Ferrante's defense attorney, William Difenderfer, told CNN Tuesday that his client is \\"devastated not only for losing his wife but being accused of it.\\" After a nationwide manhunt, Ferrante was arrested on July 25 in West Virginia. He has also been placed on immediate and indefinite leave, according to University of Pittsburgh spokesman John Andrew Fedele. Ferrante will appear in Allegheny County Court on September 23 for a preliminary hearing regarding the criminal homicide case. Another neighbor to the couple said the community is concerned about the welfare of the couple's daughter, whom he described as \\"essentially an orphan now.\\" The neighbor said it was \\"no secret\\" in the neighborhood that Klein wanted to have another baby. However, Klein told the neighbor's wife that Ferrante did not want another child, said the neighbor, who asked not to be identified. He called the whole situation \\"a tremendous shock\\" and added that this was not the kind of case where someone could say, \\"Oh, there was a lot of fighting.\\" He said he was aware of none of that. He described the couple as \\"dedicated and hard-working\\" and their daughter as \\"bubbly.\\" \\"They were hustling and trying to manage a family and the demands of the American Dream,\\" the neighbor said.

Learning self-defense techniques is crucial to protecting your personal safety. No matter your size, gender, or fitness level, you can learn how to use your body and the objects in your possession to counteract an attacker's advances. In this article, we will outline some practical and easy-to-implement self-defense tips to help you feel more confident and secure in any situation. 1. Use everyday objects as weapons An essential part of self-defense is understanding how to leverage everyday items around you as weapons. Keys, pens, and even rolled-up magazines can provide a suitable defense against an assailant. Hold these items firmly, and learn to strike where it will be most effective, such as the eyes or throat. For example, if you have keys in your hands, grip them between your fingers and use them to jab the attacker in vulnerable areas like their eyes or throat, potentially causing them to release their grip momentarily and allowing you to escape. 2. Perfect the art of powerful kicks Kicks can be potent self-defense moves, especially when you target the lower body of the attacker. A well-placed kick to the knee or groin can cause significant pain and temporarily incapacitate your opponent. Techniques like kicking your attacker as if you were breaking down a door can help maximize the force behind your kick, making it even more effective. 3. Target vulnerable areas with precision When trying to defend yourself from an attacker, targeting vulnerable areas of their body provides a higher likelihood of success. Places like the throat, eyes, and nose can cause intense pain and possibly lead to injury, making it easier for you to escape. You can use your fingers or objects you have on hand to jab or strike these sensitive areas. 4. Utilize your entire body to gain an advantage In a self-defense scenario, your entire body can become a weapon. Quick, powerful punches, headbutts, or elbow strikes can be especially effective when delivered to sensitive areas like the nose. If the attacker is attempting to hold you, use your body's weight and leverage to throw them off balance. 5. Disorient your opponent with unexpected moves Catching your attacker off guard can give you the upper hand in a self-defense situation. An effective technique to disorient your opponent is to clap your hands forcefully over their ears. This action can create a painful, disorienting sound, giving you the opportunity to escape or retaliate. Conclusion: Self-defense doesn't have to be complicated or require years of martial arts training. By utilizing the practical skills outlined in this article, you can better prepare yourself for any threatening situation that may arise. Remember, your personal safety is a priority, and it's essential to be aware of your surroundings and to trust your instincts. Incorporate these self-defense techniques into your skillset to help you feel more confident as you venture out into the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario?, what is it ?","output":"The last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario is Thomson."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Wedding\\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as \\"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Mielke was then put on trial for ordering the shootings of East Germans who were trying to defect to the West. In November 1994, the presiding judge closed the proceedings, ruling that Mielke was not mentally fit to stand trial.  During his incarceration, at JVA Moabit corrections officers supplied Mielke with a red telephone like the one in his office at Stasi Headquarters. Although it was not connected to the outside world, Mielke enjoyed having imaginary conversations with non-existent Stasi agents. His other favorite pastime was watching game shows on television.  In 1995, parole officers and Mielke's attorneys argued that he was \\"totally confused\\" and obtained his release. At 87 years of age, Erich Mielke was Germany's oldest prison inmate and had been incarcerated for 1,904 days. Days before his release, the Public Prosecutor of Berlin announced that he was \\"not interested in chasing an 87 year old man anymore\\" and that all further prosecution of Mielke had been indefinitely suspended.  According to Koehler:  [Mielke's] bank account, which held more than 300,000 marks (about US 187,500), was confiscated. Before his arrest in 1989, the most feared man in East Germany had lived in a luxurious home with access to an indoor pool. In addition, he owned a palatial hunting villa, complete with a movie theater, trophy room, 60 servants, and a 15,000 acre hunting preserve. After he was released from prison Mielke was obliged to move into a two room, 600-square-foot flat. Like all Stasi pensioners, he would henceforth have to live on 802 marks (about US512) a month.","output":"This text is about Erich Mielke, who was born in Berlin in 1907. Mielke was a powerful figure in East Germany and was in charge of the secret police, known as the Stasi. He was put on trial for ordering the shootings of East Germans who were trying to defect to the West, but he never faced punishment because of his old age and poor health.

Read this: The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has became iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.

Translate to English","output":"Gruevski said, \\"Even if the reforms do not yield the expected result regarding our NATO and EU membership, they are good in terms of improving the quality of life for the country and the people.\\" In this statement, Gruevski acknowledges that the process of implementing reforms in the country may not necessarily guarantee their inclusion into international organizations such as NATO and the European Union. However, he underlines the importance of these reforms as a positive force that can drive improvements in the overall living conditions and well-being for the citizens and the nation as a whole. These reforms may encompass a wide range of areas, such as political, economic, social, and legal changes that are required for the integration into the international community. They may address issues like strengthening democratic institutions, ensuring human rights and freedoms, reducing corruption, enhancing the rule of law, and promoting sustainable economic growth. Moreover, they can contribute to raising the country's international standing and increasing its attractiveness for foreign investors, thus paving the way for greater prosperity and opportunities. Although Gruevski highlights that the reforms might not directly result in achieving NATO and EU membership, it is still crucial to consider the indirect benefits that they can create. One of these benefits is the potential for the country to establish itself as a reliable and responsible partner in the international community. Creating a favorable domestic environment can help promote regional stability, security, and cooperation, which in turn may increase the likelihood of future collaboration with NATO and the EU. Additionally, good governance and robust institutions can facilitate a better quality of life for the people by fostering economic growth, reducing inequalities, promoting social cohesion, and enabling access to essential services such as education and healthcare. Enhanced living conditions can also lead to long-term social benefits, such as increased life expectancy, reduced crime rates, and a more active and empowered citizenry. In conclusion, Gruevski's statement emphasizes the importance of pursuing reforms, even if they do not guarantee membership in NATO and the EU, for the sake of the well-being of the nation and the people. Through these reforms, the country can achieve meaningful progress and create the foundation for a brighter and more prosperous future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Nebyl jsem si jistý, co se děje, ale rozhodl jsem se toto tajemné místo prozkoumat. Zatímco jsem chodil mezi exotickými rostlinami a stromy, objevil jsem několik místních obyvatel. Mluvili jazykem, kterému jsem nerozuměl, ale byli zdvořilí a přátelští. Ukázali mi některé zázračné věci, které jsem nikdy předtím neviděl, jako například pavučiny z duhového hedvábí nebo prameny, které měnily barvu. Poté, co jsem se zaposlouchal, jsem zjistil, že jsem začínal rozumět jejich jazyku. Bylo to téměř magické, jak jsem se přizpůsobil tomuto novému prostředí. Setkal jsem se s moudrým starcem, který mi vyprávěl příběh o tom, jak tento svět vznikl a jak předčil všechny katastrofy a zkázy. Naučil jsem se také, že v tomto snovém světě existuje zvláštní síla, která může splnit přání. Hledal jsem tuto sílu, procházel jsem nejodlehlejšími kouty této země a nacházel sílu v nejzákladnějších elementech.

Připravil jsem se na cestu zpátky do mého skutečného života, s vědomím, že tento divný sen mě nějakým způsobem obohatil.

New Market Basket stores could take months to open With Market Basket stores almost fully restocked, the company is aiming to open two or three of the five new stores it has under development by the end of the year, company executives said. The grocery chain’s second-in-command said in an interview Friday that no timeline was in place for opening all of the stores, but that expansion was “on the radar.” “Our 100 percent focus on this moment is to get these [existing] stores restocked with fresh foods, particularly perishable foods, produce, and seafoods,” said David McLean, the company’s operations manager. In a Monday appearance at the Chelsea Market Basket reported on WCVB-TV, company president Arthur T. Demoulas said his goal was to have two or three of those stores open by the end of the year. McLean said executives hoped to discuss expansion and firm up their plans in the next week or two. Once the company decides to open the stores, he said, hiring and training new employees would take six to eight weeks, he said. Of five under development, one store in Revere and another in Attleboro are completely finished and lack only “people and product,” according to Steve Paulenka, a facilities and operations supervisor who organized protests during the six-week work stoppage at Market Basket. A store in Athol is nearly complete, but Paulenka said the distance of the Attleboro and Athol stores from other Market Basket locations could make staffing more difficult. Each store would need about 400 employees, who would be trained at existing supermarkets in the chain. The closest Market Basket to both Attleboro and Athol is about 15 miles away, Paulenka said. Demoulas said Monday that the Market Basket in Revere would probably be the first to open. That store is fully permitted and equipped, according to Tony D’Agosta, the city’s chief health inspector. The store has been complete for a year, but its opening has been bogged down by disputes between Demoulas and the company’s board of directors, controlled by his cousin and chief rival, Arthur S. Demoulas. Despite the distance concerns, the other top candidates to open soon are the Attleboro store, which has been finished for several months, and the Athol location, which would be the chain’s westernmost. Only paving, lighting, and traffic marking work remain at the Athol store, said Tom Koistinen, who managed the store’s construction for general contractor Seppala Construction. At two other stores, more work remains to be done. In Waltham, construction crews are moving “full steam ahead” on an 86,000-square-foot Market Basket store, said Steven Cucinatti of Retail Management and Development Inc., which will manage the plaza where the store is being built. The firm is run by Arthur T. Demoulas’s brothers-in-law. A completion date has not been set, but Paulenka said the store “could be finished this year.” “We have a couple other tenants that are planning on opening as soon as late September, early October,” added Cucinatti. Those tenants are Marshalls, the department store, and Jake n Joes, a sports bar. At the fifth location, in Littleton, a new Market Basket should be finished by mid-October, said Sam Park, who is developing the commercial plaza where the Market Basket will be located. Checkout counters are already in place, but crews are still installing shelving and refrigeration units, said Paulenka, who visited the store on Tuesday. Still, both Paulenka and Park said a late opening was unlikely. November and December are a hectic time for retailers and grocers, and recruiting and training hundreds of new employees could be especially difficult for Market Basket at that time of year. “The closer we get to holidays, the less likely we are to open,” said Paulenka. “We’ve got to get the training done before the holidays or after the holidays.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the Market Basket grocery chain's plans to open new stores.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who said \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental?\\" is inside the article: Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite..., can you guess it ?

Article: Criminal justice agencies in England and Wales use at least two separate racial/ethnic classification systems when reporting crime, as of 2010. One is the system used in the 2001 Census when individuals identify themselves as belonging to a particular ethnic group: W1 (White-British), W2 (White-Irish), W9 (Any other white background); M1 (White and black Caribbean), M2 (White and black African), M3 (White and Asian), M9 (Any other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2 (Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-Bangladeshi), A9 (Any other Asian background); B1 (Black Caribbean), B2 (Black African), B3 (Any other black background); O1 (Chinese), O9 (Any other). The other is categories used by the police when they visually identify someone as belonging to an ethnic group, e.g. at the time of a stop and search or an arrest: White – North European (IC1), White – South European (IC2), Black (IC3), Asian (IC4), Chinese, Japanese, or South East Asian (IC5), Middle Eastern (IC6), and Unknown (IC0). \\"IC\\" stands for \\"Identification Code;\\" these items are also referred to as Phoenix classifications. Officers are instructed to \\"record the response that has been given\\" even if the person gives an answer which may be incorrect; their own perception of the person's ethnic background is recorded separately. Comparability of the information being recorded by officers was brought into question by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in September 2007, as part of its Equality Data Review; one problem cited was the number of reports that contained an ethnicity of \\"Not Stated.\\" Question: What does IC stand for?","output":"\\"IC\\" stands for \\"Identification Code\\".

We have: -6 * h = 6 * h - 4 * h Now, we need to combine the terms with \\"h\\" on the right side. When you take away 4 apples from 6 apples, you have 2 apples, right? So, let's replace 6*h with 6 apples and 4*h with 4 apples.

To do that, we can add 6*h to both sides: -6 * h + 6 * h = 2 * h + 6 * h The left side cancels out because -6 * h and 6 * h are opposites: 0 = 8 * h Now we need to solve for h.

I have a new situation: Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course.  They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature.  But I can use this background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  What is an answer for this question: If Thomas wanted the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, should he increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions?","output":"Given the background information, if Thomas wants the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, he should increase the temperature of his reactions.  Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature. 2. Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. 3. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. 4. Faster-moving particles are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. 5. Faster collisions result in a faster rate of reaction. 6. Since Justin has a faster rate of reaction due to the higher temperature, Thomas must raise the temperature of his reactions to match Justin's rate.  Therefore, Thomas should increase the temperature of his reactions to achieve a similar rate as Justin's reactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir has warned an election would be inevitable if she did not stand down. Mrs Foster is under growing pressure over the Renewable Heat Initiative. The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was launched in 2012 to help businesses ditch fossil fuels for renewables such as wood. Mrs Foster was the then enterprise minister in charge of the scheme, which was set up to help cut carbon emissions, but its flaws could cost taxpayers £490m. The subsidies offered were greater than the cost of the fuels, meaning users could legitimately earn more cash the more fuel they burned. Speaking at a meeting of party activists in Belfast on Saturday, Sinn Féin leader Mr Adams said Mrs Foster was not \\"a prime minister\\". \\"She is a co-equal partner in the Office of First and Deputy First Minister,\\" he said. \\"She can continue in that office but only for as long as Sinn Féin allows it.\\" Sinn Féin has put forward proposals for dealing with the crisis engulfing Stormont, and Mrs Foster has said they provided \\"a basis for taking an investigation forward\\". But the first minister has rejected Sinn Féin's further calls for her to temporarily step aside. Mr Adams told the meeting: \\"The DUP leader has thus far refused to stand aside, without prejudice, pending a preliminary report by an independent investigation into the RHI scandal. \\"If the first minister does not take the actions that society desires and deserves and which a sustainable process of change requires, then Sinn Féin will bring this ongoing and totally unacceptable state of affairs to an end.\\" Earlier this week, Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir warned that if Mrs Foster did not step aside temporarily, an election would be inevitable. \\"It's the greatest conflict of interest I've seen in my political life that the architect of the RHI scheme would remain in office while the investigation gets under way,\\" he said. Mr Adams said the \\"future of the political institutions are at a defining point\\", as he paid tribute to Mr McGuinness who was not at the meeting. \\"Under Martin's tolerant and tireless leadership the institutions have continued to operate and progress has been made, for example on the difficult issue of the transfer of policing and justice powers,\\" he said. In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Adams spoke about the decision to cut Irish language bursary funds, describing Communities Minister Paul Givan as an \\"ignoramus\\". \\"The DUP has also shown a serious disrespect for the Irish language and to those citizens who wish to live their lives through Gaeilge (Irish language). \\"The decision on the eve of Christmas to cut funding for the Líofa programme was a very deliberate snub to the Irish language. It was an ignorant decision taken by an ignoramus. \\"Of course we will forgive him for this.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Two farms had different plant cultivation methods. Jolly farm adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, while Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides.  Which farm caused less Nitrogen to end up in oceans? A:","output":"Jolly farm, which adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, would have caused less Nitrogen to end up in oceans compared to Peach farm that continued using fertilizers and pesticides. Permaculture is a sustainable and environmentally conscious approach to agriculture and land management that incorporates various techniques to minimize harmful practices often associated with conventional methods, such as the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. It emphasizes the development of agricultural ecosystems which not only work in harmony with nature, but also are able to regenerate and improve the overall health of the environment. The permaculture techniques implemented by Jolly farm could include the following: 1. Plant diversity: Cultivating a variety of plant species to create a balanced and diverse ecosystem that promotes healthy soil and reduces pests. 2. Crop rotation: Regularly changing the types of crops grown to prevent depletion of nutrients in the soil and to reduce pest populations. 3. Polyculture: Growing multiple crop species together in the same area to maximize space, increase soil fertility, and encourage beneficial relationships amongst plants. 4. Integration of livestock: Allowing animals to graze on the land, contributing to natural fertilization and controlling pests and weeds. 5. Use of organic matter: Utilizing compost, manure, and other organic materials to improve soil quality and provide essential nutrients without the need for chemical fertilizers. 6. Natural pest and weed control: Encouraging biodiversity and employing biological and physical controls instead of synthetic pesticides. In contrast, Peach farm relies on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to support its agricultural production. The use of chemical fertilizers, including those containing high levels of nitrogen, contributes to runoff that ultimately pollutes bodies of water, triggering excessive algal growth and the formation of dead zones. Moreover, pesticides can have detrimental effects on non-target organisms and disrupt the ecological balance. As a result of its implementation of permaculture techniques, Jolly farm would likely contribute much less nitrogen to oceans than the conventional methods employed by Peach farm. The permaculture practices followed by Jolly farm ensure effective nutrient cycling, soil conservation, and water quality protection, thereby reducing chemical runoff and minimizing harmful environmental impacts that could lead to nitrogen pollution in oceans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A velvet blazer is a timeless look that you can wear well after the velvet-revival trend has passed.  Some cuts and colors will be more versatile than others, though.  Jewel tones like deep reds and blues look gorgeous in velvet and carry the added bonus of transitioning seamlessly from day to night. A form-fitting, structured blazer is most versatile as far as cut goes, while a cropped velvet bomber jacket can be rocked recreationally. Vintage and thrift stores are great places to look for velvet blazers, or you can check out modern retailers Though your velvet blazer is undoubtedly a versatile piece, your go-to velvet jacket can’t go with just anything.  Since it has such a conspicuous texture, you need to pair it with subtler textures which will offset the velvet rather than competing with it. Cotton, wool, and cashmere are good, neutral-texture options, while shiny silk, tweed, or lace should be avoided. In order to make your velvet blazer look chic but still casual, you should wear something casual or understated underneath.  A neutral camisole or tank top are always solid options for work or play, while a funky band t-shirt can add an edge to the classy, velvet vibe. Stripes are also a great way to make a look more casual without being boring.  A striped sweater, tee, blouse, or tank top beneath a velvet blazer adds an interesting, sporty twist to an otherwise formal look. A velvet blazer can go with practically anything, including formal trousers, dresses, skirts, and jeans.  In order to make it casual, though, you’ll want to pair it with some jeans.  Distressed and light colored jeans are in style, so feel free to experiment with these trendy looks.  When in doubt, though, go for a solid, dark-rinse that looks appropriate in a variety of places and milieus. Boot-cut, skinny, and straight leg jeans will pair well with any blazer.  Flared jeans are also making a comeback, but be aware that a dramatic flare under your velvet blazer might make your look overly vintage or costumey. Depending on your personal preference, you can top off your look with a variety of footwear.  Flat combat boots or knee-highs will create a particularly laid-back feel to your ensemble, while wedges or heeled booties will add some height and polish to your look while still keeping it low-key. Platforms are back in fashion and can play up to the vintage feel of your velvet blazer without seeming overly retro or antiquated.

Hillary: Secretary of empowerment Girls hug U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a 2010 tour of a shelter run for sex trafficking victims in Cambodia. Editor's note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \\"Cooking with Grease.\\" She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000. (CNN) -- As Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton steps down from her job Friday, many are assuming she will run for president. And she may. In fact, five of the first eight presidents first served their predecessors as secretary of state. It hasn't happened in more than a century, though that may change should Clinton decide to run. After all, she has been a game changer her entire life. But before we look ahead, I think we should appreciate what she's done as secretary of state; it's a high profile, high pressure job. You have to deal with the routine as if it is critical and with crisis as if it's routine. You have to manage egos, protocols, customs and Congress. You have to be rhetorical and blunt, diplomatic and direct. As secretary of state you are dealing with heads of state and with we the people. And the president of the United States has to trust you -- implicitly. On the road with Hillary Clinton Of all Clinton's accomplishments -- and I will mention just a few -- this may be the most underappreciated. During the election, pundits were puzzled and amazed not only at how much energy former President Bill Clinton poured into Obama's campaign, but even more at how genuine and close the friendship was. Obama was given a lot of well-deserved credit for reaching out to the Clintons by appointing then-Sen. Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state in the first place. But trust is a two-way street and has to be earned. We should not underestimate or forget how much Clinton did and how hard she worked. She deserved that trust, as she deserved to be in the war room when Osama bin Laden was killed. By the way, is there any other leader in the last 50 years whom we routinely refer to by a first name, and do so more out of respect than familiarity? The last person I can think of was Ike -- the elder family member who we revere with affection. Hillary is Hillary. It's not surprising that we feel we know her. She has been part of our public life for more than 20 years. She's been a model of dignity, diplomacy, empathy and toughness. She also has done something no other secretary of state has done -- including the two women who preceded her in the Cabinet post. Rothkopf: President Hillary Clinton? If she wants it Become a fan of CNNOpinion Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at . We welcome your ideas and comments. Hillary has transformed our understanding -- no, our definition -- of foreign affairs. Diplomacy is no longer just the skill of managing relations with other countries. The big issues -- war and peace, terror, economic stability, etc. -- remain, and she has handled them with firmness and authority, with poise and confidence, and with good will, when appropriate. But it is not the praise of diplomats or dictators that will be her legacy. She dealt with plenipotentiaries, but her focus was on people. Foreign affairs isn't just about treaties, she taught us, it's about the suffering and aspirations of those affected by the treaties, made or unmade. Most of all, diplomacy should refocus attention on the powerless. Of course, Hillary wasn't the first secretary of state to advocate for human rights or use the post to raise awareness of abuses or negotiate humanitarian relief or pressure oppressors. But she was the first to focus on empowerment, particularly of women and girls. She created the first Office of Global Women's Issues. That office fought to highlight the plight of women around the world. Rape of women has been a weapon of war for centuries. Though civilized countries condemn it, the fight against it has in a sense only really begun. Ghitis: Hillary Clinton's global legacy on gay rights The office has worked to hold governments accountable for the systematic oppression of girls and women and fought for their education in emerging countries. As Hillary said when the office was established: \\"When the Security Council passed Resolution 1325, we tried to make a very clear statement, that women are still largely shut out of the negotiations that seek to end conflicts, even though women and children are the primary victims of 21st century conflict.\\" Hillary also included the United States in the Trafficking in Person report. Human Trafficking, a form of modern, mainly sexual, slavery, victimizes mostly women and girls. The annual report reviews the state of global efforts to eliminate the practice. \\"We believe it is important to keep the spotlight on ourselves,\\" she said. \\"Human trafficking is not someone else's problem. Involuntary servitude is not something we can ignore or hope doesn't exist in our own communities.\\" She also created the office of Global Partnerships. And there is much more. She has held her own in palaces and held the hands of hungry children in mud-hut villages, pursuing an agenda that empowers women, children, the poor and helpless. We shouldn't have been surprised. Her book \\"It Takes a Village\\" focused on the impact that those outside the family have, for better or worse, on a child's well-being. As secretary of state, she did all she could to make sure our impact as a nation would be for the better.

Nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit out one holiday, except of course, the grief therapist I was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul. My in-laws didn't get it! It changed FOREVER my relationship with them, and I have never been back for a holiday. This is only one example of how my grief was disrespected! My own (new) husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when I shared from my soul. I collapse, can not breathe, hyperventilate, and generally am defunct for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain.  Now about this movie... Today, my soul was stirred, my heart broken. My fears and pain re-surfaced from the real demons this movie presents; how one grieves compared to how others expect us too and the demons within. Adam Sandler portrayed perfectly the horrendous agony you face, overcome and most of all, work through on your own time! This movie dredged up all the pain that I have tried over the years to deal with. You see, when something harms your soul so profoundly, so deep that utterances are all that come from your mouth in moments of thinking, you can not deal with it without wishing you were dead and walking through life, in a dead state.  The bible has a scripture, Romans 8:26 that I have clung to, that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for, that God's Holy Spirit carries that agony to the feet of God-- I need not speak. Sandler portrayed that to perfection!  There is a scene where he has been hauled into a court hearing, for mental health commitment purposes, and he goes back in to face his in-laws--- (familiar to me)--- and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by, per Se, that he can't get over. It's a profoundly strong, and mighty performance. I started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw it first hand, my precise motions while trying to hold it all together; a lesson for him, my youngest who barely remembers his daddy. It's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my in-laws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrendering to their desires, instead of respect to my own.  I write this, so that if you are a griever, you are prepared for this movie, but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance Sandler gave.  If you are not yet a griever, please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief, letting them find peace in their own time! Sometimes, the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain.  Go see this movie with tissues and not without preparing to take it in... to your soul! How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"This review is very emotional and deeply personal. The reviewer shares their own painful experience of losing a loved one and being judged by others during their grieving process. They feel that the movie accurately portrays the struggles and emotions they went through, and they highly recommend it. They also advise others to be understanding and supportive towards people who are grieving, allowing them to heal at their own pace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise 1: A puppy plays with a tennis ball on a stone path. Premise 2: A puppy is laying on a stone path. Step 2: Determine if one premise can be deduced from the other. In this case, the puppy's action in each premise is different - in Premise 1, the puppy is playing with a tennis ball, while in Premise 2, the puppy is laying on the stone path. Step 3: Evaluate if the two premises can both be true at the same time. Since the actions of the puppy in the two premises are different and cannot occur simultaneously, they cannot both be true at the same time. Step 4: Determine the truth value of each premise. Based only on the information given in Premise 2 (\\"A puppy is laying on a stone path.\\"), we cannot determine whether Premise 1 (\\"A puppy plays with a tennis ball on a stone path.\\") is true.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If I tell you that Threatening behavior triggers stress within animals, and ask you the question \\"what do animals feel when threatened?\\", is the correct answer \\"cold\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"cold.\\" When animals feel threatened, they typically experience a range of emotions and physiological responses rather than just feeling \\"cold.\\" These responses are primarily associated with the activation of the stress response system, also known as the \\"fight-or-flight\\" response. The primary purpose of this response is to prepare animals to confront or avoid a potential threat. When animals feel threatened, they often experience: 1. Fear: This is the most common emotion experienced by animals when they perceive a threat. Fear is a natural response that helps them react appropriately to danger. It can also help animals learn to avoid similar situations in the future. 2. Anxiety: Anxiety occurs when animals anticipate a potential threat even if it is not currently present. This heightened state of vigilance and wariness can be useful in preventing animals from being caught off-guard by an actual threat. 3. Increased heart rate and blood pressure: When animals perceive a threat, their bodies respond by increasing their heart rate and blood pressure. This allows oxygen and nutrients to be delivered more quickly to the muscles and organs, preparing the animal for action. 4. Heightened senses: In response to a potential threat, animals often experience heightened senses. This can include an increased ability to detect sights, sounds, and smells which may signal the presence of danger. 5. Release of stress hormones: Animals experiencing a threat will release stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones help modulate the body's response to stress, preparing it for action. 6. Changes in body temperature: While it's not accurate to say that animals will feel \\"cold\\" when threatened, changes in body temperature may occur. For instance, some animals might experience a piloerection, or \\"goosebumps,\\" which can help them appear larger to intimidate the threat. Additionally, blood flow may be redirected to more vital organs, which might result in changes to peripheral body temperature. 7. Defensive or aggressive behaviors: Depending on the nature of the threat and the animal's temperament, it may choose to display defensive or aggressive behaviors to deter the threat. This can include hissing, growling, baring teeth, or even physical attack. In conclusion, animals feel a complex range of emotions and physiological responses when threatened, which work together to help them effectively cope with potential danger. While it is incorrect to say that animals simply feel \\"cold\\" when threatened, it is important to note that their bodies undergo various changes to prepare them for a fight-or-flight response."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Republic of Cyprus has de jure sovereignty over the island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters, according to international law, except for the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, administered as Sovereign Base Areas. However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts; the area under the effective control of the Republic, comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the north, administered by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is recognised only by Turkey, covering about 36% of the island's area. The international community considers the northern part of the island as territory of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish forces. The occupation is viewed as illegal under international law, amounting to illegal occupation of EU territory since Cyprus became a member of the European Union.

First of America Bank Corp. said it completed its acquisition of Midwest Financial Group Inc. for about 250 million. First of America, which now has 45 banks and 12.5 billion in assets, announced an agreement to acquire the Peoria, Ill., bank holding company in January. Midwest Financial has 2.3 billion in assets and eight banks. The Midwest Financial subsidiary banks will continue to operate under their current names until early 1990, when each will adopt the First of America name. Kalamazoo, Mich.-based First of America said it will eliminate the 13 management positions of the former Midwest Financial parent company. First of America said some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America. But it said that severance payments to those executives not staying with the company will reduce First of America's operating results for 1989 by 3 million to 4 million, or 15 cents to 20 cents a share.

Question: Combine facts and answer this: What is the name of the company which sells Nespresso products, which were first invented by engineer Eric Favre in 1974? Answer:","output":"The name of the company that sells Nespresso products is Nestlé Nespresso S.A., which is a subsidiary of the Swiss multinational food and beverage conglomerate, Nestlé Group. Nestlé Nespresso specializes in the production, distribution, and sale of single-serve coffee capsules, machines, and related accessories. Nespresso's journey began when the inventor and engineer, Eric Favre, was inspired to create a revolutionary and user-friendly espresso machine back in 1974. At the time, Favre worked for Nestlé in their research and development department, and the motivation for his invention was heavily influenced by his desire to replicate the high-quality Italian espresso experience within the comfort of one's home or office. Eric Favre's innovative concept involved the use of a single-serve, pre-measured, and hermetically sealed coffee capsule to ensure consistent quality and freshness. These Nespresso capsules were designed to work in harmony with specialized espresso machines that utilize high pressure to extract the coffee, resulting in a rich and aromatic cup of espresso with a layer of crema on top. After nearly a decade of research and development, the first Nespresso system was launched in 1986. Initially, it targeted mainly the professional market, introducing the coffee machines to offices and upscale establishments. But over time, the Nespresso system has successfully evolved and expanded into the consumer market as a premium and quality-driven coffee brand. Currently, Nespresso products are available in over 60 countries worldwide, with a global network of boutiques, a comprehensive online presence, and strategic partnerships that cater to a rapidly growing consumer base. In summary, Nestlé Nespresso S.A. is the company responsible for selling Nespresso products, which were first invented by the engineer Eric Favre in 1974. The innovative single-serve capsule system, combined with the advanced espresso machines, offers premium coffee experiences at home or in offices and continues to attract coffee enthusiasts seeking convenience, quality, and consistency."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],q={key:0},N={key:1};function R(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
