Upon his arrival, he meets his teammates Rip Van Kelt (Randall Batinkoff), Charlie Dillon (Matt Damon), Jack Connors (Cole Hauser), and his roommate Chris Reece (Chris O'Donnell) and learns of the school's cherished honor code system. Soon learning that his new friends are prejudiced against Jews, he suppresses his background. David becomes the team hero and wins the attentions of beautiful dÃ©butante Sally Wheeler (Amy Locane), whom Dillon claims is his girlfriend. In the afterglow of a victory over the school's chief rival St. Luke's, Dillon inadvertently discovers that David is Jewish and, out of jealousy, makes this widely known, causing Sally and his teammates to turn against Davidâsoon after, he finds a sign above his bed bearing a swastika and the words \\"Go home Jew\\". David is constantly harassed by his classmates, led by Richard \\"McGoo\\" Collins (Anthony Rapp) and his body guard-like roommate Chesty Smith (Ben Affleck); only Reece and another unnamed student remain loyal to Greene. Overwhelmed by pressure from his prestigious family, Dillon uses a crib sheet to cheat in an important history exam. David and Van Kelt each spot him doing so, but remain silent. Dillon gets pushed while leaving class and drops the sheet on the floor after the test; when the teacher, Mr. Geirasch (Michael Higgins), discovers it, he informs the class that he will fail all of them if the cheater does not confess. He leaves the task of finding the cheater up to the students, led by Van Kelt, the head prefect. When David confronts Dillon and threatens to turn him in if he does not confess, Dillon unsuccessfully attempts to buy David's silence with money. Just when David is about to reveal Dillon to the other students, Dillon accuses David. Both agree to leave and to trust the rest of the class to decide...

By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS’s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought “Dear Lord someone’s losing a limb today.” When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car.

This research revolves around the genetic changes displayed in mouth droplets which can indicate the initial stages of the disease. The findings significantly contribute towards efforts for more prompt diagnoses, given that lung cancer claims more lives in the UK than any other type of cancer. The researchers have managed to develop a particular method for dissecting the vapor inside the container where the cells being studied are growing. The method is especially notable for its capability to tell the difference between which of the two disparate genes within the cells are exhibiting faults.  Dr. Mike Davies, affiliated with the University of Liverpool Roy Castle Lung Cancer Research Programme, underscored the pioneering work they are undertaking. He expressed hope about the theoretical possibility of creating a test that can identify early lung cancer merely from a patient's breath, underscoring the urgent need for such an invention. Early diagnosis allows for more efficient treatment, potentially reducing levels of fatality caused by the disease. Nell Barrie from Cancer Research UK also chimed in on the research outcomes, describing the enticing prospect of an affordable, effective test for diagnosing lung cancer. However, she noted the still-existing gap between these promising early results and the extensive, large-scale trials that are necessary before this diagnostic technique can become widespread. In terms of the impact of lung cancer on the UK population, Cancer Research UK provided important statistics, indicating approximately 43,500 cases of lung cancer in 2011. Moreover, the same year saw around 35,200 deaths as a result of the illness. The next phase for the research team involves the creation of handheld testing devices that leverage these innovative findings.

Q: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How does the actress feel about the playwright? === The answer to the above question is Choose from: (1).

The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors. The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET). Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications   for the entrance exams. Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests. Under the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course.

Input: Context: We previously reported that the intimal endothelium of the rat aorta switches to a microvascular phenotype during angiogenesis in vitro. The microvessels formed by the rat aortic endothelium are coated with pericytes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation of the pericytes to the angiogenic process and to identify the site of origin of these cells in the aortic wall.', 'Rings of rat aorta were cultured in collagen gel under serum-free conditions. The formation of a pericyte coating around aorta-derived microvessels was evaluated by counting pericytes and microvessels in the living cultures. Pericytes and endothelial cells were studied by immunohistochemistry, lectin labeling, electron microscopy, 3H-thymidine labeling followed by autoradiography, and time-lapse video microscopy. The capacity of aortic smooth muscle cells to differentiate into pericytes was studied by coculturing intimal- or medial-derived smooth muscle cells with endothelial cells in a collagen gel overlay assay that induced reorganization of endothelial cells into microvessels.', 'Microvessels during the early stages of angiogenesis were composed primarily of endothelial cells. As vascular proliferation decreased, the microvessels became coated with pericytes. The pericytes migrated from the root to the tip of the microvessels using the endothelium as a surface for attachment, proliferation, and contact guidance. The pericytes were continuous with the myointimal endothelial cells of the cultured aorta. Pericytes and myointimal cells were positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin and were actively engaged in DNA synthesis. Treatment of the cultures with heparin caused a marked reduction in the number of pericytes. Smooth muscle cells isolated from the intimal aspect of the rat aorta migrated toward the endothelium and differentiated into pericytes when cocultured with microvessels formed by isolated endothelial cells in a collagen gel overlay assay. Conversely, smooth muscle cells isolated from the deep layers of the media had no significant endothelial tropism and failed to differentiate into pericytes.Question: Do rat aortic smooth muscle cells become pericytes during angiogenesis in vitro? Output:","output":"Yes, rat aortic smooth muscle cells become pericytes during angiogenesis in vitro. Smooth muscle cells isolated from the intimal aspect of the rat aorta migrated toward the endothelium and differentiated into pericytes when cocultured with microvessels formed by isolated endothelial cells in a collagen gel overlay assay."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Hypothesis: People do tricks on motorbikes. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, as they both correspond to the same essential idea: people performing tricks on motorbikes. However, it's crucial to analyze the context, terms, and conditions given in both the premise and hypothesis to ensure that they are entirely compatible. In this particular case, let's break down the premise and hypothesis along with their respective components. Premise: A group of people do tricks on motorbikes. - 'A group of people': This statement highlights that there is more than one person involved in this activity. - 'do tricks': This aspect emphasizes the activity or action being performed by the group of people. - 'on motorbikes': This part specifies the tool or equipment used for the execution of these actions. Hypothesis: People do tricks on motorbikes. - 'People': This word refers to individuals without emphasizing any specific number or group. - 'do tricks': This phrase, like in the premise, mentions the action being performed by people. - 'on motorbikes': Again, similar to the premise, it mentions the equipment used to perform the actions. By comparing the premise and hypothesis, we can observe that they share the same core concept - the action of individuals performing tricks using motorbikes. The only subtle difference lies in the premise's mention of a \\"group\\" of people, while the hypothesis has a more general term, \\"people.\\" However, in the broader sense, the idea remains the same in both - individuals completing tricks on motorbikes. Therefore, we can conclude that if the premise is true (a group of people perform tricks on motorbikes), it also validates the hypothesis' claim that people (at least some individuals) do tricks on motorbikes. The hypothesis is a more general assertion derived from the specific example given in the premise, and its truth is not contradicted by the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Canadian English (CanE, CE, en-CA) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada. According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.  - Australian English (AuE, en-AU) is a major variety of the English language, used throughout Australia. Although English has no official status in the Constitution, Australian English is the country's \\"de facto\\" official language and is the first language of the majority of the population.  - South African English (SAfrE, SAfrEng, SAE, en-ZA) is the set of English dialects spoken by South Africans. There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English. Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\". Other varieties of South African English include Cape Flats English, originally associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers, and the Indian South African English of Indian South Africans. Further offshoots include the first-language English varieties spoken by Zimbabweans, Zambians, Swazilanders and Namibians.  - Thomas J. O'Connell ( 21 November 1882 -- 22 June 1969 ) was an Irish trade unionist and politician , and was leader of the Irish Labour Party from 1927 to 1932 . O'Connell was born near Knock , County Mayo . From 1902 to 1916 he worked first as a national teacher and then as a school principal . In 1926 he became general secretary of the Irish National Teachers ' Organisation . He was a member of Dáil Éireann from 1922 to 1932 , serving as leader of the Irish Labour Party in the Dáil from 1927 to 1932 . From 1929 to 1930 he was president of the Irish Labour Party and the Irish Trade Union Congress . In 1935 he founded the Educational Building Society .  - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language.

The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.  - New Zealand English (NZE) is the dialect of the English language spoken by most English-speaking New Zealanders.

Context: I really struggle to feel bad for people who actively choose to be miserable and manipulative. I’m dorky and like to use little proverbs all the time. One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others.

Question: The author suffered from depression: Options: - After she was 16. - While she was 16. - Before she was 16. - not enough information Answer:","output":"The correct answer is - After she was 16. The author mentions her past relationship with an abusive ex-boyfriend when she was 16. She describes his refusal to seek help for his mental health issues. Then she mentions her own struggle with severe depression later on. These details suggest that the author's depression started after her relationship with this abusive boyfriend when she was 16. It seems the trauma from this relationship might have contributed to her later mental health issues. However, the exact time period she began experiencing depression is not clearly stated. But based on these details, we can reasonably conclude that she probably struggled with depression after she was 16 years old."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

When a person doesn't have many ice trays, it will not directly impact any specific step in the process of making ice cubes. All the steps can still be followed in the same manner, such as removing any ice cubes currently in the tray, filling the tray with cold water, and placing the tray in the freezer. However, not having many ice trays will indirectly impact the process because it will limit the number of ice cubes that can be produced at one time. If the individual requires more ice cubes than their limited trays can produce, they will have to wait until the current batch of ice cubes is frozen, remove them, refill the tray, and wait for the next batch to freeze. This can make the process of making a large amount of ice cubes more time-consuming and less efficient. The perturbation here is the limited number of available ice trays, which doesn't directly interfere with any step, but it does have an indirect effect on the overall ice cube making process, particularly concerning the quantity of ice cubes produced and the time it takes to produce them."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of Viriconium consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'.  The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer.  The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair.  The short story \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (1985; later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\") is set in our world.

He stepped down and was succeeded by the then Vice-President of Botswana, Festus Mogae, who became the third President of Botswana. Prior to this, he was a leading figure in the independence movement and then the new government, and played a crucial role in facilitating and protecting Botswanas steady financial growth and development.  - A protectorate, in its inception adopted by modern international law, is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates.  - Lenyeletse Seretse ( 25 June 1920 -- 3 January 1983 ) was Vice-President of Botswana from 1980 until his death on 3 January 1983 . From Northern Botswana , Seretse was appointed Vice-President to placate his fellow Northerners following the assumption of Southerner Quett Masire to the Presidency .  - Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a crowned republic, Ireland is a parliamentary republic, and the United States is a federal republic.  - Botswana , officially the Republic of Botswana, is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa. The citizens refer to themselves as \\"Batswana\\" (singular: \\"Motswana\\"). Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966. Since then, it has maintained a strong tradition of stable representative democracy, with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections.  - The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) is the governing party in Botswana. Its chairman is the current Vice President of the Republic of Botswana, Mokgweetsi Masisi. The previous party chairs include, among others, Ponatshego Kedikilwe, Daniel Kwelagobe, Samson Guma Moyo, and Lieutenant General Ian Khama.

Two years ago, on Berlin Film Festival we watched the Amos Kollek movie \\"Sue\\" in the Panorama program, with a wonderful Anna Thomson in the leading part.

In the same section on the Festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of Sue, \\"Extension du domaine de la lutte\\", which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having NO sex is one and the same problem. But unfortunately we can't sympathize with \\"our hero\\" (how he is called by the story-teller), because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself. Own fault, I'm sorry. I can't understand him. Not enough, the writer/director/actor want us admitting to him, that it's not his destroyed self-consciousness or the passivity of his personality, what brought him so far, but the rotten society and its image of sexuality. Yes, there are some deeper insights about gender relations, but we won't follow him so far... And the point is, that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate, having no sex. Who didn't notice yet, it's a quite depressing film... In the beginning, there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation. At the bed store the \\"hero\\" speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed. Perhaps it's too broad getting up the stairs, you have to stay at home half a day... THIS is a satire about a character, who doesn't know taking the life and heart in hands, DOING something... The movie doesn\`t follow this path, but handles his characters with helplessness. Nobody believes, that \\"our hero\\" is able to instigate Tisserand for a murder. Too dull, too kind, too - passive (not to mention Tisserand's complex; he has an inhibition, but he couldn't be, of course, a murderer of women!).

Answer the following question: Process:  - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person breathes very deeply happens, how will it affect less air is taken in through nose or mouth.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"When a person breathes very deeply, they take in a larger volume of air through their nose or mouth. This increased air intake has a few direct and indirect effects on the process listed above. Step-by-step effects of deep breathing: 1. Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth: When breathing deeply, more air is inhaled through the nose or mouth than during shallow or regular breathing. This results in a larger volume of air being available for oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal in the lungs. 2. The air travels into the windpipe: The increased volume of air still travels through the windpipe; however, the pressure inside the windpipe may be slightly higher due to the larger volume of air. 3. The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes: As the bronchial tubes are responsible for distributing the inhaled air between the two lungs, these tubes may experience an increased flow rate during deep breathing. 4. The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body: With a larger volume of inhaled air, more oxygen is available for absorption into the bloodstream. This can lead to more effective blood oxygenation as oxygen exchanges occur more efficiently on a molecular level within the lung's alveoli. 5. Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body: The increased oxygenation in the blood indirectly affects cellular respiration, which may improve the efficiency of cells filtering out and producing carbon dioxide as a waste product. 6. The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream: More oxygen in the blood can support enhanced cellular respiration, which may lead to more carbon dioxide being produced and transported back to the lungs. 7. The carbon dioxide is exhaled: With deep breathing, not only is more oxygen taken in, but more carbon dioxide is also likely to be exhaled. This can help in maintaining the appropriate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the body. In conclusion, the perturbation of breathing deeply indirectly affects the process by increasing the volume of air taken in, which can positively impact blood oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. We all present these glossy lives to the world; coffee cups presented to dewy sunrises, champagne in airport lounges, luxurious restaurants that cost more than they should and share the blue skies days of exploration. I’m as guilty as anyone. But, what about behind those scenes? Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’. So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera. This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am. I lovingly wrapped my camera in a soft scarf every day for 3 weeks, growled under my breath at anyone who looked like they might jostle me and at one point found...

A: A:","output":"Bacterial DNA typically has one circular chromosome. So, the correct answer is (IV)."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I can use this background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike is studying the predator prey relationship.

Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How long is the play in Edinburgh?

Old English verbs include strong verbs, which form the past tense by altering the root vowel, and weak verbs, which use a suffix such as -de. As in Modern English, and peculiar to the Germanic languages, the verbs formed two great classes: weak (regular), and strong (irregular). Like today, Old English had fewer strong verbs, and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms.

The Northern Ireland secretary said such a move would be the \\"last resort\\". The NI parties had agreed on a welfare reform deal in December but Sinn Féin withdrew its support in March. Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said it would be a \\"huge mistake\\" for Westminster to try to impose cuts. Speaking at the British Irish conference in Cambridge Villiers said: \\"We have come to the conclusion that if the executive cannot reach agreement on implementing the budget and welfare aspects of the Stormont House Agreement, as a last resort the government will have to step in and legislate at Westminster for welfare reform in Northern Ireland. Ms Villiers said such action by the government would be taken \\"reluctantly\\" and only if all other \\"realistic alternatives\\" had been exhausted. She urged the executive to take action to repair its public finances. \\"That means dealing with the in-year pressures in their budget in the next in-year monitoring round and it means implementing the welfare reform package agreed by the five parties during their Stormont Castle negotiations,\\" she said. \\"Without these two crucial steps, the budget agreed by the executive in June just does not add up and we face the alarming prospect of the executive breaching its control totals and starting to run out of money.\\" Ms Villiers said those who continued to block welfare reform had a \\"choice\\". \\"They can do what virtually every responsible government across the world has had to do in recent years, including in the UK and Ireland, and that is to make difficult choices to live within their means,\\" she said. \\"Or they can continue down a path of reckless irresponsibility with the damaging consequences that will have for frontline public services and the people who depend on them. \\"The government is firmly committed to the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and the financial package that underpins it.\\" Mr McGuinness, the deputy first minister, said: \\"Any move by the British government to impose its welfare cuts agenda over the heads of the assembly and executive will seriously undermine devolution and the political institutions. It would be a huge mistake. \\"This Tory government appears to be willing to jeopardise years of political progress for its own narrow right wing agenda.\\" But DUP leader Peter Robinson, the first minister, welcomed Ms Villier's speech as a \\"potential game changer\\", adding: \\"There is no doubt that this statement will introduce a dose of reality to these negotiations and make a resolution more likely.\\" Ms Villiers also told the audience on Saturday that she would release funding to allow the civil service voluntary exit scheme to go ahead. The £700m scheme, which was agreed as part of the Stormont House Agreement, has faced uncertainty because of the continuing impasse over welfare reform. The aim of the civil service exit scheme is to help Stormont balance its budget by shedding the equivalent of 2,400 full-time civil service posts. It is believed the scheme could save about £90m from the civil service's annual pay bill. The first 864 civil servants are due to leave on 30 September. On Thursday, Downing Street confirmed that \\"urgent, intensive and focused cross-party talks\\" would begin next week in Belfast in an attempt to resolve the crisis at the assembly. It was sparked by the recent murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr. The 53-year-old ex-IRA man, was killed in what police believe was part of a \\"fall-out\\" in republican circles after the murder of former IRA commander Gerard 'Jock' Davison in May. The Ulster Unionists withdrew from the executive after police said Provisional IRA members had a role in Mr McGuigan's killing. Police said an infrastructure exists at a senior level of the Provisional IRA, but that there was no evidence that Mr McGuigan's murder was sanctioned by that hierarchy. The talks, which will be held at Stormont House, will be led by Ms Villiers. The talks will cover two issues - securing the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and paramilitary activity. The five biggest parties have been asked to take part in the discussions. The Northern Ireland Executive is a power-sharing government drawing ministers from the five biggest parties. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the ongoing welfare reform issue in Northern Ireland and the possibility of Westminster stepping in to legislate if the Northern Ireland Executive is unable to reach an agreement. The Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, stated that such a move would be the \\"last resort.\\" The main parties involved in the negotiations are Sinn Féin, whose representative Martin McGuinness warned against Westminster imposition of cuts, and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), whose leader Peter Robinson welcomed the potential intervention. Villiers urged the executive to address its public finances, as the budget agreed upon in June is unsustainable without addressing welfare reform. The article also mentions the release of funding by Villiers for a civil service voluntary exit scheme, aimed at balancing Stormont's budget by eliminating 2,400 civil service posts and saving around £90 million. Finally, it mentions the upcoming focused cross-party talks prompted by the recent murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr., which will cover the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and paramilitary activity. The negotiations will involve the five leading Northern Ireland parties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Mice living in the tailor's shop come to his aid, secretly finishing the waistcoat while he is sick in bed. This charming tale highlights the themes of kindness, gratitude, and the triumph of good over adversity. Beatrix Potter was a prolific writer, and her literary contributions span a wide range of genres, including natural science, conservation, and history.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the guru that the groom's father tries to bribe? , can you please find it?   Music student Nancy, the 19-year-old daughter of Frank, real estate broker, and Elaine Benson (Bob Hope and Jane Wyman), wants to marry fellow music student David, the 20-year-old son of Oliver Poe, record producer. What the bride doesn't know is that her parents are about to get a divorce. Poe is opposed to marriage and doesn't want the kids to get married. At the church, when the wedding is in progress, he exposes the Bensons' secret. Nancy and David decide marriage isn't necessary. They will live together instead, travel around the country with a rock band and heed the advice and wisdom of a Persian mystic called the Baba Zeba. Frank and Elaine are seeing other people. He is involved with a divorcee, Lois Grey, while she is developing an interest in Phil Fletcher, who also is recently divorced. Poe, meanwhile, continues to see, LaVerne Baker, his live in girl friend. Then one day, Nancy finds out she is pregnant. The Baba Zeba persuades her to put up the baby for adoption, paid off by Oliver. Frank and Elaine conspire behind their daughter's back to adopt their own grandchild. Complications arise, resulting in Frank trying to bribe the guru and even disguising himself as one of the Baba Zeba's robed followers. By the end, all is resolved; the Bensons get back together, David and Nancy have their baby, even Poe and LaVerne have married giving the film a thriced blessed happy ending. A:","output":"In the given article, the full name of the guru that the groom's father tries to bribe is called the Baba Zeba. The rationale for this conclusion comes from carefully reading the entire article for any relevant information about a guru. The article mentions \\"Baba Zeba\\" as a Persian mystic and later mentions \\"Frank trying to bribe the guru\\". Since Frank corresponds to the groom's father in the context, and only one guru is mentioned in the article, it's logical to surmise that the Baba Zeba is the guru the groom's father tries to bribe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was met with a small drop of water as it made its way out the bathroom door. As he looked inside he found wet towels, soap and more toys thrown over the floor. Miles of toilet paper lay in a heap  and toothpaste had been put over the mirror and walls. As he rushed to the bedroom, he found his wife still sleeping in the bed in her pajamas,reading a novel.

The new wave of diplomats often came from those programs. Archaeology on the international scene, although very much of intellectual interest to the major universities, fell into the shadow of international relations. Their domain became the Ancient Near East, which could no longer be relied upon to be the Near East. The Ottoman Empire was gone, along with all the other empires of the 19th century, replaced with independent republics. Someone had to reconcile the present with the past. This duty was inherited by various specialized agencies that were formed to handle specific aspects of international relations, now so complex as to be beyond the scope and abilities of a diplomatic corps in the former sense. The ancient Near East is frozen in time. The living Near East is primarily what the agencies say it is.

Should I validate this answer?  (A). No.  (B). Yes. Answer:","output":"A). No. The suggested answer does not seem to address the original question. The question is asking about the appropriate planting time for triticale, whereas the suggested answer discusses the adaptation of the milling industry to triticale and milling techniques.  A more suitable answer for the original question would be something like: Triticale is typically planted in the fall or early spring, depending on the specific variety and local climate conditions. Fall planting is usually done from late September to early November, giving the plants enough time to establish before winter. On the other hand, spring planting usually occurs from late February to early April, depending on the last expected frost date in your area. It is essential to choose a variety suited to your geographical region and planting time to ensure optimal growth and yield. Make sure to prepare the soil with proper nutrients and maintain adequate moisture levels throughout the growing season.

Movie plot title: Solaris Movie plot: Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) spends his last day on Earth reflecting on his life while walking by a lake near his childhood home where his elderly father still resides. Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris. After decades of study, the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed. The crew is sending confusing messages. Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard the ship and determine whether the venture should continue. Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky), a former space pilot, visits Kelvin. They watch film footage of Berton's own testimony years before of seeing a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists. However, the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface; Berton's report was dismissed as hallucinations. After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience, Berton angrily departs, only to contact Kelvin later via videophone from his private car. He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission, and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris. Before departing Earth for Solaris, Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire, noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated. In Kelvin's last conversation with his father (Nikolai Grinko), they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return. Although he readily accepted the mission, it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin's conscience. Upon his arrival at Solaris Station,[10][11] a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan), had killed himself. The two surviving crewmen are uncooperative and evasive.

Please answer the following question: Answer the question below:   When it is very warm what happens to the speed of items speed up or slow down?    Assuming that:  For a given medium, sound waves travel more slowly at lower temperatures. A:","output":"When considering the effect of temperature on the speed of various items, particularly sound waves, we need to focus on the medium (such as air, water, or a solid material) through which the waves or particles move. In general, when the temperature of a medium increases, particles gain kinetic energy and move more rapidly. This causes an increase in the speed of sound and other items traveling through the medium. For example, the speed of sound in air increases as the temperature rises. When air is heated, molecules move more quickly, allowing sound waves to propagate through the air at a faster rate. For every increase of 1°C (1.8°F) in temperature, the speed of sound in the air rises by about 0.6 meters per second (1.3 miles per hour). Temperature also affects the speed of other items like fluids and solid materials. In liquids, increased temperature results in molecules moving more freely, leading to lower viscosity or resistance to flow. This permits liquids to flow more easily through a pipe or channel. Similarly, in solid materials, a rise in temperature causes the atoms and molecules to vibrate faster, which can lead to a decrease in the material's strength and stiffness, allowing deformation to be more probable and potentially increasing the speed of various processes. To summarize, when the temperature is very warm, the speed of items such as sound waves and particles in a medium generally increase due to the higher kinetic energy of the particles in the medium. This speeding up can also be observed in processes involving liquids and solid materials. It is important to note, however, that the specific effect of temperature on speed depends on the particular item and the medium involved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. \\"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business.

Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Why is Biji paralysed? Movie plot title: Fire Movie plot: The film opens with young Radha sitting in a mustard field with her parents. Her mother tells her a story of a person who wanted to see the ocean; then she explains that sometimes one must learn to see some things (through her mind's eye) without looking. The film flashes forward to Sita, a newly married young woman, trying to perceive some emotion from her husband Jatin. Jatin appears distant and shows little interest in Sita or in being married. Sita is given a perfunctory welcome by Jatin's family. Jatin is in a typical joint family arrangement. He lives with his older brother Ashok, his sister-in-law Radha, his invalid mother (Biji) and the family servant Mundu. Their apartment is on the second floor of a two story dwelling in a crowded marketplace in New Delhi. Ashok and Jatin run a small store (on the first floor) that sells food (for takeout) and rents videotapes. Sita is gradually exposed to various difficulties. She is also in a typical arranged marriage, but she learns that Jatin married her only to put an end to Ashok's incessant nagging. Jatin continues to date his Chinese girlfriend. Sita does not rebuke him for fear that it may bring dishonour to her parents. The rest of Jatin's home is not rosy either. Biji is paralysed and without speech after a stroke, and Sita and Radha must constantly attend to Biji (even her hygiene). Sita spends her days slaving in the hot and greasy kitchen, and she finds herself lonely and frustrated at night because Jatin is out dallying with his girlfriend. On the financial front, the store provides a modest income but their expenses are very high and they are unable to expand their business or buy a bigger home. Sita resignedly accepts these difficulties, but yearns to break out of this stifling and hopeless situation. It is later revealed that Radha faces a somewhat similar problem. Many years ago, Ashok had come under the influence of Swamiji, a local preacher, who teaches that desires are the cause of suffering and must be suppressed. Ashok is completely taken by...

Tiger's new identity on display as Masters Week begins Updated APR 09, 2015 12:40a ET After his life was torn apart by rape accusations, Kobe Bryant knew he no longer could be himself. It had become too painful to hear what they were yelling from the stands. And it was all starting to take its toll on his performances on the court. So he decided to create an alter ego. \\"I had to organize things, so I created the 'Black Mamba,'\\" he says in the recent revealing Showtime documentary, \\"Kobe Bryant's Muse.\\" \\"So, Kobe has to deal with these issues, all the personal challenges. The Black Mamba steps on the court and does what he does. It was just ... f--- everyone. I'm destroying everybody that steps on the court.\\" Bryant once said of the Black Mamba that \\"there's a difference between who you are and what you are.\\" \\"When I stepped on that court, I became that killer snake, and I'm stone cold.\\" Tiger Woods was a killer, too. The deadliest of assassins when the tournament was on the line. And stone cold. Woods once famously walked through the Augusta National clubhouse getting ready for a Sunday Masters run and was so enveloped in his cocoon that he ignored even the goodwill wishes of his mother and Nike chairman Phil Knight. Fourteen times he took the lead into Sunday at a major and closed the deal. But that Tiger has long been gone. Maybe it was the shock of losing to Y.E. Yang in the 2009 PGA Championship — the first time he'd ever coughed up a third-round lead at a major — or more likely because of the scar tissue that came from his tabloid scandal later that same year. Whatever the pathology, he hasn't just not played like the Tiger of old in majors since his last win seven years ago — he also hasn't acted like him, either. Woods has spent the past six years searching for an identity. And this week, he might just have found one. He arrived at Augusta National — where he last won a green jacket 10 years ago, when Jordan Spieth was 11 — late on Monday afternoon with earbuds resting on his shoulders. He went to the practice range and started listening to hip-hop. \\"I just wanted to rock out,\\" Woods said during an uncharacteristically open Tuesday news conference. \\"It was just nice. That's what I practice in at home. Practicing for hours on end, it's nice to have a little bit of tunes.\\" *By clicking \\"SUBSCRIBE\\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Last time Tiger rocked out to tunes at a major? Then came the back slapping and joking around with a number of different players who came to wish him well in his return from a self-imposed two-month exile. Remember when he gave beatdowns to the pretenders to his throne? Now he's giving them bro hugs. And on Wednesday, Woods will play the Par 3 contest for the first time since 2004. Like any proud dad, he'll have his kids, Sam and Charlie, act as his caddies. \\"It's special,\\" he said. \\"This tournament means so much to me in so many different ways. We all know what happened in '97 with my dad's health, and he was pronounced — well, he was dead at one point earlier that year; came back, and then came here and I won the Masters. \\"To now have come full circle and to have a chance to have my kids out there and be able to share that with them, it's special. It just means the world to me.\\" Emotional, nostalgic, softer and kinder; safe to say, this is a different — and probably psychologically healthier — Tiger. But can he still win? Typically, he insists that nothing has changed. \\"I'm still trying to beat everybody out there,\\" he said. But surely only everything has changed. There's no longer a sense of dread or intimidation among his peers when Tiger steps to the tee. Instead, there's something that resembles curiosity. As Rory McIlroy said, he'll be watching. \\"And just like everyone else, I'll be looking for his score and seeing what he's doing,\\" McIlroy said. When Kobe became the Black Mamba he won two NBA championships — was the MVP in both series — and won another MVP title. Maybe Tiger will kill them with kindness?

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the highwayman whose skeleton was shown in the image of the dissection  Having been tried and found guilty of murder, Nero has now been hanged and his body taken for the ignominious process of public dissection. The year after the prints were issued, the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be \\"dissected and anatomised\\". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate. While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves. The president has been identified as John Freke, president of the Royal College of Surgeons at the time. Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749. Aside from the over-enthusiastic dissection of the body and the boiling of the bones in situ, the image portrays the procedure as it would have been carried out.Two skeletons to the rear left and right of the print are labelled as James Field, a well-known boxer who...

Write an article based on this summary: Move the refrigerator. Measure from the back of the space to the front of the counter. Repeat the measurement. Decide if you want the refrigerator to extend past the counters. Allow at least an inch of space behind the refrigerator. Article:","output":"Title: How to Properly Measure and Position Your Refrigerator for Seamless Integration Introduction: The kitchen is one of the most essential areas of any home. It is where families come together, friends share laughter and meals, and memories are created. And the refrigerator, undeniably, is one of the key components of any kitchen. A well-placed, correctly measured refrigerator not only adds to the overall aesthetic of the kitchen but also ensures optimal function. In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to measure and position your refrigerator for seamless integration into your kitchen layout. Step 1: Move the refrigerator The first step in positioning a refrigerator is to move it from its current spot. This allows you to measure the dimensions accurately and have easy access to the space you'll be placing it in. Ensure that there is enough room for the refrigerator and that it can be moved safely. Disconnect the fridge from any power sources and remove any items that might make it difficult to relocate, such as magnets, books, or plants on top of the fridge. Step 2: Measure the available space Begin by measuring the space where the refrigerator will be placed. Start from the back wall and measure to the front edge of the counter adjoining the refrigerator. Use a measuring tape and ensure that the measurements are precise and consistent. Be sure to take into account any obstacles or protrusions in the area that could potentially affect the fridge's final placement. Step 3: Repeat the measurement To ensure accuracy, it is necessary to repeat the measurements. Errors can occur when taking measures, and it is essential to verify that the recorded dimensions are accurate. Repeat the measuring process from the back of the space to the front of the counter, making sure to account for any obstacles or protrusions, as mentioned earlier. Comparing the results will help you identify any discrepancies and confirm the space's right dimensions. Step 4: Decide if you want the refrigerator to extend past the counters Some homeowners prefer their refrigerator to sit flush with the edge of the counter, while others prefer a few inches of the fridge to extend past the counter for easier access. Consider your personal preferences and how it will impact your kitchen's aesthetics and functionality. Keep in mind that professional-counter-depth models are often more expensive than traditional refrigerators, so be aware of your budget limitations when making this decision. Step 5: Allow for sufficient clearance behind the refrigerator Finally, it is essential to ensure that there is enough space behind the refrigerator for airflow and easy access to the back of the fridge for maintenance or potential repairs. It is recommended to allow at least an inch of clearance between the back of the refrigerator and the wall. This space serves to enhance the appliance's efficiency and lifespan, as proper ventilation helps maintain the refrigerator's ideal operating temperature. Conclusion: Measuring and positioning your refrigerator accurately is essential to make your kitchen both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Taking the time to follow these steps will result in a seamless integration of your refrigerator into your kitchen space. Remember that the key to successfully placing your refrigerator is careful measurement, adequate clearance, and personal preferences regarding the fridge's projection concerning the counters. After all, a well-integrated kitchen is a vital element of a comfortable and welcoming home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Of the 12.6% of United States residents who identified as black, around 10.3% were \\"native black American\\" or ethnic African Americans, who are direct descendants of West/Central Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves. These individuals make up well over 80% of all blacks in the country. When including Multiracial American, about 13.5% of the US population self-identified as black or \\"mixed with black\\". However, according to the U.S. census bureau, evidence from the 2000 Census indicates that many African and Caribbean immigrant ethnic groups do not identify as \\"Black, African Am., or Negro\\". Instead, they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the \\"Some Other Race\\" write-in entry. As a result, the census bureau devised a new, separate \\"African American\\" ethnic group category in 2010 for ethnic African Americans.

It elected one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. In its last configuration, the electoral district included the communities of Fairview, Armdale, Cowie Hill, Fairmount and Kline Heights - all within the Halifax Regional Municipality.  - The Nova Scotia New Democratic Party is a social-democratic provincial party in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is aligned with the federal New Democratic Party (NDP). It was founded as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932, and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. It became the governing party of Nova Scotia following the 2009 Nova Scotia election. It is the first New Democratic Party in Atlantic Canada to form a government. Much of the party's success prior to the 2009 election was based in the urban areas of the provincial capital, Halifax, however the party's support has grown to the rest of Nova Scotia.  - Manitoba is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers with a widely varied landscape. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south.  - Atlantic Canada is the region of Canada comprising the four provinces located on the Atlantic coast, excluding Quebec: the three Maritime provinces  New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia  and the easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the four Atlantic provinces in 2011 was about 2,300,000 on half a million km.  - The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) (from 1955 the \\"\\") was a social-democratic and democratic socialist political party in Canada. The CCF was founded in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta, by a number of socialist, agrarian, co-operative, and labour groups, and the League for Social Reconstruction. In 1944, the CCF formed the first social-democratic government in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in Saskatchewan. In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the New Democratic Party (NDP). The full, but little used, name of the party was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist).  - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election.  - Graham Steele ( July 8 , 1964 , Winnipeg , Manitoba ) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician , having represented the constituency of Halifax Fairview in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2001 - 2013 for the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party .

Q:Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Cardiovascular System: Arteriosclerosis Compliance allows an artery to expand when blood is pumped through it from the heart, and then to recoil after the surge has passed. This helps promote blood flow. In arteriosclerosis, compliance is reduced, and pressure and resistance within the vessel increase. This is a leading cause of hypertension and coronary heart disease, as it causes the heart to work harder to generate a pressure great enough to overcome the resistance. Arteriosclerosis begins with injury to the endothelium of an artery, which may be caused by irritation from high blood glucose, infection, tobacco use, excessive blood lipids, and other factors. Artery walls that are constantly stressed by blood flowing at high pressure are also more likely to be injured—which means that hypertension can promote arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it. Recall that tissue injury causes inflammation. As inflammation spreads into the artery wall, it weakens and scars it, leaving it stiff (sclerotic). As a result, compliance is reduced. Moreover, circulating triglycerides and cholesterol can seep between the damaged lining cells and become trapped within the artery wall, where they are frequently joined by leukocytes, calcium, and cellular debris. Eventually, this buildup, called plaque, can narrow arteries enough to impair blood flow. The term for this condition, atherosclerosis (athero- = “porridge”) describes the mealy deposits (Figure 20.14).

It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer/director dedicated no time in elbaorating, and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue.

For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature. Finally, in test E he replaced the solvents in each of the earlier tests with water.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which case the solute would be more soluble, case A or case B?  Hint: As you can see in Figure above , solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson. A:","output":"In case B, the solute would be more soluble. As mentioned in the hint, solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases, which is true for solvents other than water as well. Since test A involves a liquid solute in a solvent at room temperature and test B involves the same solute but with an increase in temperature, the solute would be more soluble in case B. This increased solubility can be attributed to the increased kinetic energy at higher temperatures, causing the solvent molecules to interact more effectively with the solute and dissolve it more easily.

OPTIONS: (i) negative; (ii) positive;...I think the answer is","output":"(i) negative. The review clearly indicates a strong negative opinion of the movie, as evidenced by multiple criticisms of its elements. Firstly, the reviewer directly states that the movie is \\"one of the very worst comedies ever made\\" and that it's \\"unfunny from the very opening, to the tacked-on scene during the credits.\\" This demonstrates a clear disapproval of the overall quality and humor of the film. The review also criticizes several of the actors in the movie, including Diane Keaton, Dax Shepard, Liv Tyler, and Ken Howard. The reviewer suggests that Diane Keaton needs to \\"re-learn her craft\\" and that Dax Shepard requires a better director to show him how to act. Liv Tyler is mentioned as \\"not up to her role,\\" while Ken Howard is described as \\"not as good as he used to be.\\" These critiques of the movie's acting further emphasize the negative viewpoint held by the reviewer. Additionally, the reviewer addresses the film's writing by calling out screenwriter Mike White, stating that he \\"needs to find another character\\" as he has done the same type of person \\"a few times too many.\\" Lastly, the provided ratings by the reviewer are consistently low, with a score of 1 out of 10 on IMDb, 25 out of 100 points, and 1 star out of 4. These low ratings further support the idea that the reviewer holds a negative opinion of the movie. In conclusion, the reviewer's criticisms of various aspects of the film, such as humor, acting, and writing, lead to a clear negative assessment of the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - GTM Cars is a component kit car manufacturer located in Kingswinford, UK.  - A kit car, also known as a component car, is an automobile that is available as a set of parts that a manufacturer sells and the buyer then assembles into a functioning car. Usually, many of the major mechanical systems such as the engine and transmission are sourced from donor vehicles or purchased new from other vendors. Kits vary in completeness, consisting of as little as a book of plans, or as much as a complete set with all components included.  - An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat, which then creates a force. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: What do you call a leader of a theocratic and cultish movement with a deep and clear disdain for democracy who suddenly assumes dictatorial powers? A \\"moderate,\\" of course.      Ever since the Muslim Brotherhood broke its promise to stay out of Egypt's presidential election in the aftermath of the revolution, many Western observers have been in denial about what has been going on. In less than half a year, Mohamed Morsi has deftly built the apparatus of despotism.      Much as the Nazis brilliantly cast themselves as reformers sweeping away the corruption of the Weimar Republic, Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood have been using the effort to clean up the detritus of Hosni Mubarak's dictatorship as an excuse to consolidate power.      In August, when Islamists attacked Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai (in an apparent effort to force Egypt into a confrontation with Israel), Morsi used the incident as an excuse to replace Mohamed Hussein Tantawi — a Mubarak-era holdover who headed the military and guarded its independence — with officers more pliable to the Brotherhood.      \\"Are we looking at a president determined to dismantle the machine of tyranny,\\" Alaa Al Aswany, a popular novelist and democratic activist, asked at the time, \\"or one who is retooling the machine of tyranny to serve his interests?\\" That question quickly became, at best, rhetorical.      Morsi proceeded to purge scores of newspaper editors and publishers, declare himself in charge of the drafting of the new constitution and all but wore a sandwich board with the words \\"I'm becoming a dictator!\\" on it.      As if to hammer it home, last week Morsi announced that his rule was immune to judicial oversight of any kind. He used the failure of the courts to adequately punish Mubarak-era holdovers as an excuse. It was just that — an excuse, not an explanation.      Morsi softened his language Monday, but aides insisted his edict stood. And the Brotherhood's position remains clear. \\"If democracy means that people decide who leads them, then [we] accept it; if it means that people can change the laws of Allah and follow what they wish to follow, then it is not acceptable,\\" the Brotherhood explained on its website in 2005.      Before Morsi was announced the winner of June's election, the Brotherhood massed in Tahrir Square to make its expectations clear. As one Brotherhood member explained to Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, \\"We win or we die.\\" Not a particularly democratic motto.      Morsi did have another excuse for seizing power last week: The timing was good. Because he helped broker a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel, the White House lavished praise on him. Morsi immediately cashed in that political capital.      On the New Republic's website, Trager posted a devastating condemnation of Morsi's apologists under the headline \\"Shame on Anyone Who Ever Thought Mohammad Morsi Was a Moderate.\\" Trager's one error is he assumes that, after Morsi's latest power grab, no one could possibly still think Morsi's a moderate after Thursday's decree.      But that's exactly what many still believe. For instance, on ABC's \\"This Week\\" on Sunday, Time magazine's Joe Klein spoke for many inside the Beltway when he celebrated Morsi's role in the cease-fire as a \\"wonderful sign for the future\\" because it showed he and the Muslim Brotherhood are \\"moderates.\\"      Bear in mind that even as Morsi was pocketing praise from the West, Mohammed Badie, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, made it clear that war to liberate Palestine remained its goal, once Muslim unity is achieved. \\"Jihad is obligatory.\\"      Apparently, \\"moderation\\" in the Middle East has been defined down to not wanting to wage war on Israel right now.      On Monday, a Brotherhood-affiliated TV network announced that Morsi allegedly agreed to limit his power grab, while maintaining that the constitution being drafted by Morsi's pet Islamists will remain immune to judicial review. That the Egyptian people aren't lying down for the Muslim Brotherhood's steamroller is heartening, but that doesn't mean Morsi's intended goal is any less obvious.      jgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com ||||| Photographer: Rick Friedman/Bloomberg Close Close Open Photographer: Rick Friedman/Bloomberg      Is democracy in Egypt over before it started? Skeptics abroad and protesters in Egypt think so after President Mohamed Mursi’s unilateral decree that his decisions are not subject to judicial review by the nation’s constitutional court.      The fears are exaggerated -- this is not the scene in the movie where the democratically elected Islamic leader reveals himself as a religious dictator. Mursi overreached in his decree and explained it poorly. Yet he did it in the service of preserving electoral democracy. And he has reportedly taken a first step to repair the damage: agreeing to limit the scale of the decree to “sovereign matters,” such as protecting the assembly now writing Egypt’s constitution.      The concerns of Egyptian and foreign secularists are understandable. Democracy means more than just elections. Those elected by the people must adhere to constitutional procedures, not take the fact of their election as a mandate to govern without restraint. When Mursi stated that he would not be bound by the decisions of the constitutional court because “God and the people” had chosen him, he sounded disturbingly like Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini -- or like a fascist dictator.      Yet, despite appearances, Mursi’s decree does not represent the “one man, one vote, one time” scenario many consider inevitable when an Islamist party comes to power through democracy. One must consider the full context of Egypt’s tumultuous, ongoing revolution -- and the highly questionable role Egypt’s constitutional court has played in it.      Rubber Stamp      Under President Hosni Mubarak, the constitutional court enjoyed a good reputation for moderating dictatorial rule. Critics contended that it was little more than a rubber stamp for the regime, but its defenders rightly pointed out that it was still more impressive than any other constitutional body in any Arab state.      Since Mubarak fell and the Islamists were elected, the court has actively tried to constrain the government. The impulse may have been public-spirited at first, but it quickly descended into anti-democratic partisanship on the side of the army. The culmination of the court’s efforts came when it dissolved the elected legislature in June. In a subsequent interview, one of the court’s justices admitted that the court was on the side of the military regime all along and prepared its rulings against the legislature from the moment the elections took place.      There is good reason to think that the court was poised to dissolve the elected constituent assembly, just as it dissolved the parliament -- one more step toward declaring the presidential election invalid and creating a constitutional coup d’etat against Mursi.      Make no mistake: The result of any such action by the courts would be to assure the continued power of the military leaders, who have not accepted the results of the elections. The struggle between the elected Islamists and the army is not over. Properly speaking, Mursi’s decree is part of that struggle. Perceiving the court as a tool of the military, he was trying to take it out of the game pre-emptively.      Yet the means Mursi adopted were naive -- and they backfired badly. Nothing in the interim constitution, or in general constitutional principles, allows the president to ignore a court’s constitutional judgment.      What Mursi should have done was turn to the constituent assembly itself. With no permanent constitution in place, it is the assembly that embodies the will of the people, not the president. If sovereignty lies anywhere in such a period of post-revolutionary uncertainty, it is with the collective body chosen to make the new ground rules.      Credible Argument      If the constituent assembly declared that it could not be dissolved by the constitutional court, it would have a credible constitutional argument as well as a powerful political one. Many constitutional experts would say that a constituent assembly can do anything it wants, so long as it does not violate fundamental human rights. Certainly it would be within the power of the assembly to abolish the court in a final, ratified constitution. It follows, then, that the assembly should be able to protect itself against a usurping court.      Mursi would have been wiser to issue a limited decree announcing prospectively that the assembly would remain in force and in office even if the courts tried to dissolve it. By appearing instead to place himself above the law, however, he undercut the very democratic ideal to which he should have appealed.      Having now agreed to limit the scope of his decree, Mursi should also clarify that he is not claiming any inherent authority for the presidency, but is simply affirming the principle that the constitutional court cannot dissolve the constituent assembly. This would send a signal to supporters of democracy in Egypt and abroad that Mursi wants to uphold the democratic process, not subvert it.      Right now, Mursi has substantially weakened his domestic legitimacy, generating for the first time violent protests against him. Internationally, things are worse: Coming on the heels of his public support for Hamas, Mursi has made himself look like a dictator in the making. Democracy is not yet dead in Egypt. But Mursi must do more to demonstrate that he still believes in the system that brought him to office.

Peter, Moira and Wendy go out to a charity dinner honoring Wendy's long life of charitable service to orphans. Upon their return, they discover the house has been ransacked and the children have been abducted. A cryptic ransom note, signed Captain James Hook, has been pinned to the playroom door with a dagger. Wendy confesses to Peter that the stories of Peter Pan are true and that Peter himself is Pan, having lost all of his childhood memories when he fell in love with Moira.

Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command:   1. count: returns the number of rows in the view.   2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view.   3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row.   4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments.   5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column.   6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column.   7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column.   8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column.   9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal.   10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance.   11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument.   12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments.   13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument.   14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument.   15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument.   16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table   17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.   20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: eq { count { filter_all { all_rows ; country } } ; 12 } Student:","output":"Part #1: filter_all { all_rows ; country } Usage: This part of the command returns the entire table (view) with a focus on the \\"country\\" column. It doesn't filter any rows, so all rows are included in the output. Part #2: count { filtered_table } Usage: Given the filtered_table (in this case, all rows with a focus on the \\"country\\" column), this part of the command counts the number of rows present in the filtered_table. Sample response: 15 (assuming there are 15 rows in the table). I think it meets the criteria because it correctly calculates the number of rows based on the specified filter. Part #3: eq { count_of_rows ; 12 } Usage: This part compares the count of rows (obtained in Part #2) with the number 12. Sample response: False (since the count was 15, not 12). I think it meets the criteria because it correctly compares the calculated count of rows with the given number (12). Given the command and the above explanations, this is a \\"count\\" type of problem (category 6), as it is focused on counting the number of rows in the table based on the values in one column (country) and comparing the count with a specific number."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The crowd, eagerly observing from the sidelines, quiets down in a hushed anticipation of the awe-inspiring display of athleticism about to occur. As he nears the designated throwing line, the man feels a surge of adrenaline fueling his body, foreshadowing the power and precision requisite to perform the task at hand with the utmost proficiency. The history of javelin throwing dates back to ancient times, with its origins in both sport and hunting. It was incorporated into the Olympic Games of Ancient Greece in 708 BC, serving as a testament to the rich and diverse history of this event.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Hirata is a successful Japanese businessman whose plan for a two-week winter holiday in Hawaii to play golf changes when his elderly grandfather reminds him that he should go to Iceland. Hirata's parents died there seven years ago, and the seven year death anniversary is a significant event in Japanese culture. Hirata must perform a ceremony in the river where they died after drowning in an avalanche – the drowned must be fed by the surviving family members if they are to find peace. Hirata goes to Iceland – to Reykjavík. His final destination is a remote river on the far side of the island. He encounters one mishap and misadventure after another. He first accidentally gets on a wrong bus filled with German tourists traveling to see the hot springs. He also confronts a language barrier; Hirata cannot speak any Icelandic, and knows very little English. After his first day's misadventures, Hirata decides to purchase an ancient, bright red Citroën DS to make the journey. During the long drive, Hirata meets several strange people along the way. These include the mystical woman who sells him the car, that only plays one radio station. Next, Hirata meets a local woman who collects photographs of funerals. The following day, Hirata meets two American hitchhiker/fugitives (Lili Taylor and Fisher Stevens), who turn out to be armed and dangerous who proceed to steal his car. Nearing his destination on foot, Hirata arrives in a small village where he meets an old man named Siggi, the owner of a local lodge who teaches Hirata how to drink the most potent alcoholic beverage in Iceland. Answer:","output":"In the given context, Hirata, the successful Japanese businessman, was confronted with a language barrier during his trip to Iceland. His journey to Iceland was intended to honor and perform a ceremony for his deceased parents on their seven-year death anniversary, which is a significant event in Japanese culture. However, his journey became a series of misadventures and challenges, one of which was his struggle with language. Upon arriving in Reykjavík, Hirata could not speak Icelandic and had a limited understanding of English, which hindered his ability to communicate with locals and navigate Iceland. This language barrier led to several mishaps, including mistakenly boarding a bus with German tourists that was heading towards the hot springs instead of his intended destination. In his quest to reach the remote river where he needed to perform the ceremony, Hirata came across various peculiar individuals. The language barrier made it even more difficult for him to understand and interact with them. For instance, he had trouble communicating with the mystical woman who sold him an ancient, bright red Citroën DS, which only played one radio station. His inability to communicate effectively also caused challenges with a local Icelandic woman who collected funeral photographs. Furthermore, Hirata encountered two American hitchhiker/fugitives, who turned out to be armed and dangerous, and ultimately stole his car. His limited English skills may have heightened the difficulty in comprehending their intentions, leaving him vulnerable to their criminal actions. As Hirata neared his destination, he arrived at a small village on foot and met an old man named Siggi, the owner of a local lodge. Siggi taught him how to drink Iceland's strongest alcoholic beverage. Although it is not explicitly stated, the language barrier would have likely caused confusion and misunderstandings during these interactions as well. In conclusion, Hirata was confronted with a language barrier during his trip to Iceland that greatly impacted his ability to communicate with locals, understand Icelandic culture, and smoothly navigate the country. This barrier led to a series of misadventures, encounters with unusual people, and various obstacles in achieving his primary goal of performing a ceremony for his deceased parents. Despite these challenges, Hirata's determination and perseverance pushed him forward in accomplishing the crucial task and honoring his family's traditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation -7*p - 96 = -14*p - 5*p for p, we'll begin by combining the terms containing the variable p on both sides of the equation: -7*p - 96 = (-14*p) + (-5*p) Now, we'll combine like terms on the right side: -7*p - 96 = -19*p Next, we will isolate p by getting all p terms on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 19*p to both sides: -7*p + 19*p - 96 = -19*p + 19*p Which simplifies to: 12*p - 96 = 0 Now, in order to solve for p, we must get p alone on one side of the equation. To do that, we will add 96 to both sides: 12*p - 96 + 96 = 0 + 96 Which simplifies to: 12*p = 96 Finally, to find the value of p, we will divide both sides of the equation by 12: 12*p / 12 = 96 / 12 This simplifies to: p = 8 So, the solution to the equation -7*p - 96 = -14*p - 5*p is p = 8."},{"instruction":"Question: I can use this background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat.

Spokesman said money being temporarily held and would be given away. In 2008 BBC faced investigation after keeping £100,000 of charity money.","output":"Title: The Upsurge in Charity Finances: Transparency and the Importance of Effective Money Management Introduction: Charitable organizations play a vital role in addressing various social issues and helping those in need. The charity sector has experienced a significant growth in recent years, with an increasing number of funds being raised to support various causes. However, transparency and effective management of these funds are crucial in ensuring their optimal utilization and preserving public trust. This article delves into a recent report about a charity with £2.2 million in its accounts and the importance of effective money management, drawing parallels with a BBC investigation back in 2008. Body: A surge in charitable funds: Recently, it was reported that a certain charity had an impressive £2.2 million in its accounts, up from £900,000 the previous year. This substantial increase in funds is certainly a positive indicator of the organization's ability to raise money for the causes it supports. While this growth in funds is commendable, it also brings to the fore the responsibility of managing the additional financial resources efficiently. Spokesman's statement: Addressing the issue, the charity spokesman reassured the public that the money was only being temporarily held, and the funds would soon be given away to the appropriate causes, echoing the organization's commitment to fulfilling its mission. This clarification is essential in maintaining the trust and goodwill of the public, as they would want to know how their donations are being utilized. The 2008 BBC investigation: A similar situation unfolded in 2008 when the BBC faced an investigation involving alleged mismanagement of charity funds. The broadcasting corporation was accused of keeping £100,000 of charity money, resulting in an inquiry into their conduct. Though the circumstances may differ, the BBC case highlights how trust in an organization can wane due to perceptions of mishandled funds. The importance of transparency and effective money management: Both cases emphasize the importance of transparency and effective money management in the charity sector. Public scrutiny demands that charities are accountable for every penny they receive from donors and how they are allocated. Proper money management not only preserves public trust, but also helps ensure that the funds are distributed effectively and meaningfully to the intended recipients. Conclusion: The increase in available funds for charitable organizations is undeniably a positive development. However, it is crucial to remember the importance of being transparent and accountable for every pound raised. Ensuring that the funds are handled responsibly, and with the best intentions, will ultimately result in achieving the objectives of these charities and maintain public faith in their crucial work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First rule of our treasure hunt, if we see the same number on both sides of the equation, we can remove them. Can you see the -3716 on both sides here? Yes, they're the same. So almost like magic, we can make them disappear from both sides! After doing that, what do we get now? Our equation looks like this now: -5*z = 0. That's much simpler, right? The next step is to isolate z, to find out its secret value. That \\"-5\\" and the \\"z\\" are multiplied together (that's what it means when they're written next to each other), so we need to do the OPPOSITE of multiplication to get z alone. The opposite of multiplication is division.  Therefore, we want to divide both sides of the equation by -5, so we can find out what z is. When we divide 0 by -5, we still get 0. It's like trying to share zero candies among 5 kids, each kid gets zero candie.  So, in this equation, z = 0. We found the treasure! Isn't equation-solving a fun adventure?

Head to your local thrift store or search online for vintage pins, buttons and brooches. If you want to go for a preppy feminine look, pick a jeweled cameo brooch. For an edgier style, choose a simple button or enamel pin with an animal, word, or symbol on it. Keep in mind that your pins should be school-appropriate. Don’t choose a button that has a swear word on it or anything that could be considered inappropriate. One of the best ways to show off your style is by dressing up your uniform with jewelry. Pick a statement necklace paired with simple earrings and a ring or 2. If you aren’t allowed to wear necklaces, pick a pair of fun earrings, like tassle or pom-pom earrings to match your uniform. This is also a helpful strategy for drawing people’s attention away from your uniform and onto your face. Choose a solid-color, embellished, or patterned headband, and wear it with your hair up or down. If you don’t like headbands, purchase a bow on a clip and put it in your hair to hold back your bangs or use it highlight a sleek ponytail or high bun. You can use a ribbon to pull up your hair, or incorporate it into a classic braid. Most schools allow hair accessories, but some might require them to be solid colors. Check your school handbook to make sure. For a cozy and trendy look, put on a wool scarf with a fun pattern in colors that match your uniform. If it’s warmer outside, try tying a silk or satin scarf around your neck with a bow for a classic fashion statement. If your school has rules about not wearing hats, they may not allow scarves. Be sure to consult the handbook before you wear a scarf to class. Pick a small, square piece of fabric, and fold it into quarters. Position it in your pocket so the folded corner of the square is pointing up to your shoulder. Be sure to choose a fabric that matches with your school uniform or tie. For an edgier look, try mixing patterns, like stripes and polka dots, or use a pocket square that showcases your interests, like one printed with binary code if you like computer science.

Plot: Act 1: - Jean Laroche, a prominent and influential businessman in a small Louisiana town, accidentally discovers a dark secret involving various illegal activities taking place deep within the surrounding swamplands. Unbeknownst to Laroche, he possesses a piece of vital information that could put an end to these activities and those responsible forever.    - Determined to do the right thing, Laroche arranges to meet with a local investigative journalist by the name of Sarah Miller. Before he can hand over the evidence, Laroche is found dead, killed by what appears to be an alligator attack in the swamp. - Vincent, a worn-out detective from a nearby city going through tough times, comes to town after hearing about Laroche's mysterious death. With no impressive cases under his belt and hoping to turn his luck around, Vincent takes on this investigation. Act 2: - Vincent soon realizes that Laroche's death is not just an unfortunate encounter with an alligator. As he begins to dig deeper, he discovers numerous pieces of evidence pointing toward the illegitimate activities being carried out in the swampland. - Vince partners up with Sarah to investigate further, as they find themselves getting closer to the hidden truth. Along the way, they encounter numerous obstacles, including violent thugs, corrupt officials, and relentless swampland forces that make it difficult to navigate through the treacherous terrain. - During their investigation, Vincent and Sarah stumble upon an underground criminal organization led by a mysterious figure, The Swamp Lord, who controls the illegal activities within the swampland. As they follow the trail of evidence, they unmask various accomplices and collaborators within the town, including some of its respected figures. Act 3: - In a climactic confrontation, Vincent and Sarah confront the Swamp Lord, who reveals himself to be a high-ranking official within the town. The list of his collaborators includes various powerful individuals who will do anything to protect their illegal ventures. - Armed with evidence implicating the criminal organization, Vincent and Sarah engage in a thrilling chase through the swampland to bring the criminals to justice. Along the way, they face several close encounters as the relentless alligators native to the swampland are unleashed upon them. - Eventually, an intense showdown takes place on a precarious boat chase through the swamp. The alligators, initially sent to kill Vincent and Sarah, catch up to the Swamp Lord, resulting in his demise; a just and fitting end for concealing the nature of Laroche's death and orchestrating the corrupt empire hidden within the swamplands. - With the defeat of the Swamp Lord and his accomplices, Vincent and Sarah succeed in exposing the criminal organization and the illicit activities in the swampland. The movie concludes with the pair handing over the irrefutable evidence to the appropriate authorities, who promise to bring justice to the victims and put an end to the illegal activities that have long plagued the swampland region. Swampland Secrets is a gripping tale of determination, justice, and uncovering the truth. Filled with action, suspense, and thrilling twists, it takes the audience on a wild ride through the dangerous swamplands and the power dynamics at play in the seemingly quiet town."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you will be presented with a question in Dutch language, and you have to write the person names from the question if present.

After General Motors announced it was killing its Facebook advertising just days before Facebook's IPO, Ford sent a tweet aimed at its auto rival (h/t Business Insider):      A GM executive told the The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that Facebook advertising was ineffective. Critics have used metrics such as click-through rate to cast doubt on the product-pushing power of Facebook. A Webtrends report puts the Facebook click-through-rate (ad clicks vs. views) at 0.05 percent, far less than Google Display's 0.4 percent.      GM declined to comment for this story.            A Ford spokesman later reinforced the company's message, saying the old rules don't apply on such a new platform.      \\"You won't make the right choices if you view Facebook as an advertising network,\\" Matt Van Dyke, Ford's director of marketing communications, told Forbes. \\"You can't just pick up advertising that would run somewhere else and put it on Facebook as an ad banner.\\"      Ford, for its part, says the company has had success integrating paid advertising and content together on Facebook, according to Forbes. Ford also says it has collaborated directly with the social networking site.      A source familiar with Facebook's advertising deal with General Motors said the automaker had misused the platform. When GM tried to promote an application for its Chevrolet Plant a Tree campaign last fall, it focused on developing the app without properly investing in the channels to get it seen -- a combination of paid advertising and content -- according to the source, who asked not to be identified.      \\"You can't take an 'if you build an app, they will come' approach,\\" the source explained to The Huffington Post.      The idea behind the application was that Chevy would plant a real tree in a national forest for every virtual one planted by a user. Although the application was posted on Chevy's page, it didn't receive additional distribution via paid media, the source said.      In addition, the application, developed by an agency hired and later fired by GM, appeared below the fold of the presentation and was designed as a one-time interaction \\"instead of giving users a reason to come back over and over again,\\" the source added.      The Biggest Risks To Facebook's Business      The Biggest Risks To Facebook's Business      1 of 13 Mark Zuckerberg Controlling Too Much Perhaps the most eye-popping risk listed in the S-1 is the idea that Mark Zuckerberg's bad decision-making could lead to a decline in company value. Along with \\"users fleeing\\" and \\"decline in advertising revenue,\\" the following was listed as a major risk factor: Our CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock. Zuckerberg owns 58 percent of Facebook stock, which means that he \\"has the ability to control the outcome of matters\\" that come before stockholders. Furthermore: As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as a result of voting agreements, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. Should stockholders fear the man who controls the company they hold stock in? Share this slide:      Getty Images ||||| Ford executives noted the abrupt abandonment of Facebook advertising by their cross-town rivals at General Motors and reiterated that they’re approaching social-media marketing differently. They also offered very thinly veiled criticism of GM’s move.      “We are doing more advertising on Facebook,” Matt VanDyke, Ford’s director of marketing communications, told me, “and it is a growing and critical part of our media mix.”      And presumably referring to GM, he said, “You won’t make the right choices if you view Facebook as an advertising network. You can’t just pick up advertising that would run somewhere else and put it on Facebook as an ad banner.”      Another highly ranked Ford-marketing insider was more critical of GM, calling it “odd to summarily cut off” paid advertising on Facebook. “It’s still the early days of this, and the metrics aren’t defined 100 percent,” said this observer, who declined to be identified. “But [social media] are so massive in their reach, and appropriately guided and applied, [advertising on Facebook] can be potent.      “Wouldn’t you just say to Facebook, ‘We’re not going to spend as much on paid advertising right now, and in order to earn our business, can we come up with something more clever and that is going to meet our objectives?” That’s how most marketers would approach it.”      GM’s decision, revealed on Tuesday, rocked the social-media and advertising worlds in part because the news came a few days before Facebook’s planned IPO on Friday, which could value the company at 100 billion or more. And GM hasn’t been alone among big-brand marketers in voicing uncertainties about whether paid advertising on Facebook — despite its user base and ubiquity — is worth the investment.      Still, the amount that GM paid to Facebook for advertising was only about 10 million a year, according to the Wall Street Journal, which broke the story. That amounts to only about two days’ worth of overall media buying by the automotive behemoth, pointed out Rebecca Lindland, director of research for IHS Automotive, in a Forbes.com post on Tuesday.      And GM executives noted that they are still spending another roughly 30 million a year on their brands’ overall Facebook presence, including content initiatives that can be integrated with paid advertising.      But VanDyke and Scott Monty, Ford’s global head of social media, told me that Ford has made its Facebook presence productive for its brands and nameplates by ensuring that paid advertising is integrated with content on Facebook and usually is directly pertinent to a vehicle launch. “We collaborate with Facebook and decide what works,” VanDyke explained. “Our focus is on meaningful partnerships to generate engagement.”      For example, Ford recently combined paid advertising and content on Facebook in a “customizer” app for the Mustang, which included sponsored placement of a video on the logout page. “We got one million views in one day,” VanDyke said. “We found a unique way to use the logout page.”      Ford also has a Facebook presence, including paid advertising and other content, for its NBC Saturday-night show, Escape Routes, a promotion for the new 2013 Escape utility vehicle. And last year, it used a similarly integrated Facebook platform to create interest in the new 2012 Explorer utility vehicle. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Ford has been making effective use of Facebook's advertising platform, focusing on integrating paid advertising and content and collaborating directly with the social media site.

However, if we assume that the perturbation hypothesis is related to the person's ability to consume water processed at a lower temperature, it could have an indirect effect on the process. If the water must be heated to a higher temperature to meet the individual's specific needs, then the process might require more energy and time to achieve the desired outcome.

The bulge is some 8,000 cubic km in size and has risen by about 15cm since 2002.      The team thinks it may be the result of strong winds whipping up a great clockwise current in the northern polar region called the Beaufort Gyre.      This would force the water together, raising sea surface height, the group tells the journal Nature Geoscience.      \\"In the western Arctic, the Beaufort Gyre is driven by a permanent anti-cyclonic wind circulation. It drives the water, forcing it to pile up in the centre of the gyre, and this domes the sea surface,\\" explained lead author Dr Katharine Giles from the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) at University College London.      Arctic summers have seen a decline in both ice extent and thickness      \\"In our data, we see the trend being biggest in the centre of the gyre and less around the edges,\\" she told BBC News.      Dr Giles and colleagues made their discovery using radar satellites belonging to the European Space Agency (Esa).      These spacecraft can measure sea-surface height even when there is widespread ice cover because they are adept at picking out the cracks, or leads, that frequently appear in the frozen floes.      The data (1995-2010) indicates a significant swelling of water in the Beaufort Gyre, particularly since the early part of the 2000s. The rising trend has been running at 2cm per year.      Model prediction      A lot of research from buoys and other in-situ sampling had already indicated that water in this region of the Arctic had been freshening.      This fresh water is coming in large part from the rivers running off the Eurasian (Russian) side of the Arctic basin.      Winds and currents have transported this fresh water around the ocean until it has been pulled into the gyre. The volume currently held in the circulation probably represents about 10% of all the fresh water in the Arctic.      Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.      Of interest to future observations is what might happen if the anticyclonic winds, which have been whipping up the bulge, change behaviour.      \\"What we have seen occurring is precisely what the climate models had predicted,\\" said Dr Giles.      \\"When you have clockwise rotation - the fresh water is stored. If the wind goes the other way - and that has happened in the past - then the fresh water can be pushed to the margins of the Arctic Ocean.      \\"If the spin-up starts to spin down, the fresh water could be released. It could go to the rest of the Arctic Ocean or even leave the Arctic Ocean.\\"      If the fresh water were to enter the North Atlantic in large volumes, the concern would be that it might disturb the currents that have such a great influence on European weather patterns. These currents draw warm waters up from the tropics, maintaining milder temperatures in winter than would ordinarily be expected at northern European latitudes.      Cracks, or leads, in the ice provide vertical surfaces against which the wind can push      The creation of the Beaufort Gyre bulge is not a continuous development throughout the 15-year data-set, and only becomes a dominant feature in the latter half of the study period.      This may indicate a change in the relationship between the wind and the ocean in the Arctic brought about by the recent rapid decline in sea-ice cover, the CPOM team argues in its Nature Geoscience paper.      It is possible that the wind is now imparting momentum to the water in ways that were not possible when the sea-ice was thicker and more extensive.      \\"The ice is now much freer to move around,\\" said Dr Giles.      Cryosat-2: Esa's newest radar satellite is dedicated to studying the polar regions      \\"So, as the wind acts on the ice, it's able to pull the water around with it. Depending on how ridged the surface of ice is or how smooth the bottom of the ice is - this will all affect the drag on the water. If you have more leads, this also might provide more vertical ice surfaces for the wind to blow against.\\"      One consequence of less sea-ice in the region is the possibility that winds could now initiate greater mixing of the different layers in the Arctic Ocean.      Scientists are aware that there is a lot of warm water at depth.      At present, this deep water's energy is unable to influence the sea-ice because of a buffer of colder, less dense water lying between it and the floes above.      But if this warm water were made to well up because of wind-driven changes at the surface, it could further accelerate the loss of seasonal ice cover.      The CPOM team is now investigating the likelihood of this happening with Cryosat-2, Esa's first radar satellite dedicated to the study of the polar regions.      \\"We now have the means to measure not only the ice thickness but also to monitor how the ocean under the ice is changing,\\" says Dr Seymour Laxon, director of CPOM and co-author of the study, \\"and with CryoSat-2, we can now do so over the entire Arctic Ocean.\\"      Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter ||||| SHARE: Adjust text size:            Sea surface in a particular area of the Arctic Ocean has increased by as much as 15 centimeters (6 inches) over the past 15 years, leading to the formation of a large bulge of freshwater. It is estimated that this region of the ocean contains as much as 8,000 cubic kilometers (1,919 cubic miles) of water.            According to the results of a new study, which appears in the latest online issue of the top journal Nature Geoscience, it would appear that the bulge is being caused by an acceleration of the Beaufort Gyre, an oceanic circulation pattern driven by Arctic winds.            What this implies is that a change in this wind could allow this dome to fall apart, and all the freshwater it contains to spill in the northern sectors of the Atlantic Ocean. This is where the North Atlantic Drift – one of the five major oceanic currents – releases heat from the water            That heat is then moved eastwards by prevailing winds, heating up the majority of the European continent. Last time the current was blocked – back when the sea that contained all the Great Lakes poured into the Arctic Ocean – glaciers moved as far south as the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.            Using data from the            Since 2002, researchers explain, the amount of water in the bulge has grown to accumulate as much as 10 percent of all freshwater in the Arctic. This amount is sufficient to affect north Atlantic currents, as well as the Gulf Stream circulation.            “When we looked at our data on a year-to-year basis, we noticed that the changes in the sea surface height did not always follow what the wind was doing, so we thought about reasons why this might happen,” CPOM research fellow Katharine Giles explains.            “One idea is that sea ice forms a barrier between the atmosphere and the ocean. So as the sea ice cover changes, the effect of the wind on the ocean might also change,” adds the scientist, who was also the lead author of the study            As the situation in the Arctic Ocean develops, ESA will continue to use its spacecraft to keep an eye on sea levels. In the near future, this responsibility will be passed on to the Sentinel constellation of satellites.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, \\"When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it. But it's not as funny as when Homer falls off the roof.

Given the question: Where could you find a person standing next to a net? - ocean - soccer game - fishing gear - fisherman's boat - fishing boat  The best answer is The answer is:","output":"It is difficult to provide a single best answer as the context in which a person is standing next to a net can be varied and depends on the specific situation. However, here is an analysis of each of the options provided: 1. Ocean: People who are standing next to a net near the ocean could be involved in various beach or water activities. They may be fishermen casting their nets out into the sea, beach volleyball players standing next to the volleyball net, or individuals involved in water sports that require nets, such as water polo. 2. Soccer game: At a soccer game, you could find a person standing next to a net, specifically as a goalkeeper, whose primary responsibility is to defend the goal and prevent the opposing team from scoring. Additionally, soccer coaches, players, or even spectators might stand near the net during the game for different reasons, such as to replace the goalkeeper, retrieve the ball, or simply observe the game closely. 3. Fishing gear: A person standing next to fishing gear likely has a connection to the fishing industry or hobby. This could include professional fishermen, fishing enthusiasts, or people working at a fishing gear store. In this context, the net may be used for fishing, either as a tool to catch fish or as a supportive tool, such as helping to secure fishing equipment or fish after they have been caught. 4. Fisherman's boat: If a person is standing next to a net on a fisherman's boat, they are most likely involved in the fishing industry. They could be fishermen actively using the net to catch fish, deckhands assisting in the boat's operations, or other workers who ensure the nets are properly maintained and ready for use. On a fisherman's boat, the presence of a net indicates that the boat is designed and equipped for catching fish using nets as opposed to other fishing methods such as rods and lines. 5. Fishing boat: Similar to the fisherman's boat, a person standing next to a net on a fishing boat is most likely connected to the fishing industry. They may be a fisherman, deckhand, or another worker involved in the process of catching and/or processing fish. Fishing boats are used to catch fish utilizing various fishing methods, and a net may be one of the primary tools employed for this purpose. In conclusion, the best answer would depend on the specific context in which a person is standing next to a net. In the context of a sports event, a soccer game would be the most appropriate answer, while for fishing-related contexts, a fisherman's boat or a fishing boat would be the best option to choose. For a beach or ocean setting, the context could be varied, and further information would be required to determine the most suitable answer. Keep in mind that there might be other situations not listed here in which a person is standing next to a net, such as other sports, recreational activities, or professional occupations."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Four years later, a newly divorced woman, medical doctor Sarah Cassidy (Elisabeth Shue), and her 17-year-old daughter Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) move to a small, upscale town. Their house is near the house where the massacred family lived. As told by the neighbors, four years prior, a girl named Carrie-Ann Jacobson killed her parents, then fled into the forest and was never seen again, leaving her brother Ryan (Max Thieriot) as the sole survivor. Ryan now lives alone and is hated by his neighbors; Bill Weaver (Gil Bellows), a local police officer, appears to be Ryan's only supporter. The mother-daughter relationship becomes rocky and Elissa starts dating Ryan against her mother's wishes, finding Ryan to be lonely but a sweet boy. Ryan confides in her that he accidentally injured Carrie-Ann by allowing her to fall from a swing when they were little; he was supposed to be watching her while their parents were getting high on drugs. The resulting brain damage from the accident made her extremely aggressive, leading to their parents' murder. Ryan is revealed to have been secretly taking care of a seemingly now-grown Carrie-Ann (Eva Link) in a hidden room. When she, Ann, escapes, Ryan accidentally kills her while trying to hide her. In grief, he goes to the diner, where he meets a kind waitress named Peggy (Jordan Hayes). Later, some unruly high school boys pick a fight with Ryan and he flees, and Elissa drives to his house and subdues a fire the boys started.

Given the question \\"How would Jordan feel as a result?\\", is \\"safe\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"safe\\" can be considered a valid answer to the question \\"How would Jordan feel as a result?\\". Let's explore why this response could be considered appropriate. When looking at the given context, Jordan is about to go to bed, and Jesse is reading Jordan a story. The scenario implies that both Jordan and Jesse are likely comfortable in their shared environment, allowing for potential feelings of safety, security, and contentment.  Many children experience a bedtime routine that involves storytime as a way to relax, wind down, and fall asleep. For some children, hearing bedtime stories can create a sense of peace, promote security, and establish a predictable routine. Stories chosen tend to be soothing, depicting warm experiences, implying to the child that they are safe. In addition, if Jesse is a parent, sibling, caregiver, or trustworthy figure, this might contribute to Jordan's feeling of safety, knowing that someone they rely on is close by and looking out for their well-being. However, it is important to note that individuals may have different reactions to a bedtime story. While one child may feel safe, another might feel anxious or scared if the story contains themes that they find unsettling or if the storytelling environment doesn't foster a feeling of security. Nevertheless, in general, bedtime stories are intended to bring a sense of calm and comfort to children. Considering the context provided, it can be inferred that Jordan might feel safe as a result of the bedtime story. However, it is crucial to recognize that this answer largely depends on the specific elements within the story, the environment, and Jordan's unique response to those elements."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible answers: seek medical advice, bathe the leg in hot water, set Ash's leg themselves A:","output":"In this situation, the most appropriate and responsible action for Sydney to take would be to seek medical advice for Ash. Since Ash has fallen off their horse and broken their leg, it is crucial to ensure that they receive professional medical care as soon as possible. This will help guarantee proper management of the injury and prevent any further complications from arising. Attempting to bathe the leg in hot water would not be an advisable course of action in this case. While warm water may help alleviate pain and discomfort in certain situations, it is not an effective treatment for a broken leg. Instead of helping, immersing the injured leg in hot water could potentially cause more harm than good, such as worsening the swelling or inflammation of the affected area. Trying to set Ash's leg themselves would also not be a recommended approach for Sydney. Setting a broken bone requires specialized knowledge, skill, and experience to ensure that the bone is properly aligned and secured for optimal healing. Incorrectly setting a broken leg could lead to various complications, such as prolonged recovery, improper bone healing, chronic pain, or even the need for further surgeries or procedures to correct the issue. By seeking medical advice from a healthcare professional, Sydney can ensure Ash receives the best possible care for their injury. A healthcare professional will be able to assess the severity and type of fracture, recommend the most appropriate treatment, and provide guidance on pain management and recovery. This could include immobilization through a cast or splint, pain medications, potential surgery if necessary, and a referral to a physiotherapist for rehabilitation as the healing progresses. In summary, Sydney should prioritize seeking medical advice for Ash's broken leg. It is necessary to consult a healthcare professional to guarantee the appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and management of this injury to prevent complications and ensure a successful recovery."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I will never forget my first English class.

The refractive index can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the wavelength of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values: the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, and similarly the wavelength in that medium is λ = λ/n, where λ is the wavelength of that light in vacuum. This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and that the frequency (f = v/λ) of the wave is not affected by the refractive index. As a result, the energy (E = h f) of the photon, and therefore the perceived color of the refracted light to a human eye which depends on photon energy, is not affected by the refraction or the refractive index of the medium. What's the best answer to this question: does refractive index vary with colour of light?","output":"Yes, the refractive index varies with the color of light. This variation occurs because different colors of light have different wavelengths. When light travels through a medium, the interactions between the light waves and the medium depend on the wavelength of the light. As a result, different colors of light travel at slightly different speeds within the medium, causing the refractive index to be different for each color. This phenomenon is known as dispersion, which leads to the separation of light into its constituent colors when it passes through materials such as a prism. One common example of dispersion is the formation of a rainbow, where sunlight is separated into its different colors as it passes through water droplets in the atmosphere. In summary, the refractive index does vary with the color of light due to the wavelength-dependence of the light-medium interactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While Ozzy Osbourne was working on new solo album material in 2006, Rhino Records released Black Sabbath: The Dio Years, a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single \\"The Devil Cried\\" reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the 1981 Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about the name of the group, Iommi stated \\"it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [and] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again.\\" Ward was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with \\"a couple of the band members\\". He was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the Mob Rules (1981) and Dehumanizer (1992) albums.  Heaven & Hell toured the U.S. with openers Megadeth and Machine Head, and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, titled Live from Radio City Music Hall. In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album, which was recorded in the following year. In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the Metal Masters Tour, alongside Judas Priest, Motorhead and Testament. The box set, The Rules of Hell, featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour. In 2009, the band announced the name of their debut studio album, The Devil You Know, released on 28 April.  On 26 May 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41-year career, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members.  In March 2010, Black Sabbath announced that along with Metallica they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate Record Store Day. It was released on 17 April 2010.  Ronnie James Dio died on 16 May 2010 from stomach cancer.

Racial Bias, Even When We Have Good Intentions The deaths of African-Americans at the hands of the police in Ferguson, Mo., in Cleveland and on Staten Island have reignited a debate about race. Some argue that these events are isolated and that racism is a thing of the past. Others contend that they are merely the tip of the iceberg, highlighting that skin color still has a huge effect on how people are treated. Arguments about race are often heated and anecdotal. As a social scientist, I naturally turn to empirical research for answers. As it turns out, an impressive body of research spanning decades addresses just these issues — and leads to some uncomfortable conclusions and makes us look at this debate from a different angle. The central challenge of such research is isolating the effect of race from other factors. For example, we know African-Americans earn less income, on average, than whites. Maybe that is evidence that employers discriminate against them. But maybe not. We also know African-Americans tend to be stuck in neighborhoods with worse schools, and perhaps that — and not race directly — explains the wage gap. If so, perhaps policy should focus on place rather than race, as some argue. But we can isolate the effect of race to some degree. A study I conducted in 2003 with Marianne Bertrand, an economist at the University of Chicago, illustrates how. We mailed thousands of résumés to employers with job openings and measured which ones were selected for callbacks for interviews. But before sending them, we randomly used stereotypically African-American names (such as “Jamal”) on some and stereotypically white names (like “Brendan”) on others. The same résumé was roughly 50 percent more likely to result in callback for an interview if it had a “white” name. Because the résumés were statistically identical, any differences in outcomes could be attributed only to the factor we manipulated: the names. Other studies have also examined race and employment. In a 2009 study, Devah Pager, Bruce Western and Bart Bonikowski, all now sociologists at Harvard, sent actual people to apply for low-wage jobs. They were given identical résumés and similar interview training. Their sobering finding was that African-American applicants with no criminal record were offered jobs at a rate as low as white applicants who had criminal records. These kinds of methods have been used in a variety of research, especially in the last 20 years. Here are just some of the general findings: ■ When doctors were shown patient histories and asked to make judgments about heart disease, they were much less likely to recommend cardiac catheterization (a helpful procedure) to black patients — even when their medical files were statistically identical to those of white patients. ■ When whites and blacks were sent to bargain for a used car, blacks were offered initial prices roughly 700 higher, and they received far smaller concessions. ■ Several studies found that sending emails with stereotypically black names in response to apartment-rental ads on Craigslist elicited fewer responses than sending ones with white names. A regularly repeated study by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development sent African-Americans and whites to look at apartments and found that African-Americans were shown fewer apartments to rent and houses for sale. ■ White state legislators were found to be less likely to respond to constituents with African-American names. This was true of legislators in both political parties. ■ Emails sent to faculty members at universities, asking to talk about research opportunities, were more likely to get a reply if a stereotypically white name was used. ■ Even eBay auctions were not immune. When iPods were auctioned on eBay, researchers randomly varied the skin color on the hand holding the iPod. A white hand holding the iPod received 21 percent more offers than a black hand. The criminal justice system — the focus of current debates — is harder to examine this way. One study, though, found a clever method. The pools of people from which jurors are chosen are effectively random. Analyzing this natural experiment revealed that an all-white jury was 16 percentage points more likely to convict a black defendant than a white one, but when a jury had one black member, it convicted both at the same rate. I could go on, but hopefully the sheer breadth of these findings impresses you, as it did me. There are some counterexamples: Data show that some places, like elite colleges, most likely do favor minority applicants. But this evidence underlies that a helping hand in one area does not preclude harmful shoves in many other areas, including ignored résumés, unhelpful faculty members and reluctant landlords. But this widespread discrimination is not necessarily a sign of widespread conscious prejudice. When our own résumé study came out, many human-resources managers told us they were stunned. They prized creating diversity in their companies, yet here was evidence that they were doing anything but. How was that possible? To use the language of the psychologist Daniel Kahneman, we think both fast and slow. When deciding what iPod to buy or which résumé to pursue, we weigh a few factors deliberately (“slow”). But for hundreds of other factors, we must rely on intuitive judgment — and we weigh these unconsciously (“fast”). Even if, in our slow thinking, we work to avoid discrimination, it can easily creep into our fast thinking. Our snap judgments rely on all the associations we have — from fictional television shows to news reports. They use stereotypes, both the accurate and the inaccurate, both those we would want to use and ones we find repulsive. We can’t articulate why one seller’s iPod photograph looks better; dozens of factors shape this snap judgment — and we might often be distraught to realize some of them. If we could make a slower, deliberate judgment we would use some of these factors (such as the quality of the photo), but ignore others (such as the color of the hand holding the iPod). But many factors escape our consciousness. This kind of discrimination — crisply articulated in a 1995 article by the psychologists Mahzarin Banaji of Harvard and Anthony Greenwald of the University of Washington — has been studied by dozens of researchers who have documented implicit bias outside of our awareness. The key to “fast thinking” discrimination is that we all share it. Good intentions do not guarantee immunity. One study published in 2007 asked subjects in a video-game simulation to shoot at people who were holding a gun. (Some were criminals; some were innocent bystanders.) African-Americans were shot at a higher rate, even those who were not holding guns. Ugly pockets of conscious bigotry remain in this country, but most discrimination is more insidious. The urge to find and call out the bigot is powerful, and doing so is satisfying. But it is also a way to let ourselves off the hook. Rather than point fingers outward, we should look inward — and examine how, despite best intentions, we discriminate in ways big and small.

Boone.","output":"Title: \\"Unleash the Berserkers\\" Step 1: Establish genre and setting Since the movie is about releasing Berserkers, we can consider this to be an action-packed thriller set in a near-future, dystopian world where highly advanced warrior machines known as \\"Berserkers\\" exist. Step 2: Introduce protagonist Boone is the central character, a gifted scientist and engineer who firmly believes that the Berserkers are the ultimate weapon to protect humanity against external threats. Step 3: Set up the initial situation In this world, mankind is at the brink of extinction due to the invasion of an alien species. The global government has held back the use of Berserkers, considering them too unstable and dangerous. Desperate, Boone is determined to prove that the Berserkers may be the last hope for humanity's survival. Step 4: Introduce key characters and relationships - Boone's close friend, Luna, an experienced field agent highly skeptical about the potential consequences of using the Berserkers. - General Hammond, the military leader, torn between his loyalty to the government and the possible benefits of deploying the Berserkers. - Xanar, the alien adversary, a ruthless warlord set on wiping out the human race. Step 5: Develop the main conflicts - Boone faces both internal and external conflicts as he struggles with his ethical stance on using these powerful weapons and argues with opposing members of the military and government. - The dynamic between Boone and Luna constantly fluctuates as Luna's skepticism clashes with Boone's faith in the Berserkers, testing their friendship. Step 6: Complicate the situation Upon uncovering information about a massive alien attack, Boone decides to take matters into his own hands and secretly releases the Berserkers. Step 7: Climax The Berserkers manage to defend the city from the first wave of the alien invasion, but they become unpredictable and start causing major collateral damage. Boone now has to face the consequences of his actions and find a way to regain control over the Berserkers. Step 8: Show character growth and resolution Boone, with the help of Luna and General Hammond, manages to deactivate the Berserkers, saving what's left of the city and its inhabitants. Boone realizes the potential dangers of the Berserkers, reaffirming his belief in finding a more humane solution to human conflicts. Step 9: Leave room for future developments After repelling the aliens, humanity now has a fighting chance. Boone, Luna, and General Hammond join forces to develop new strategies for defeating the alien invaders without relying on the Berserkers. In conclusion, \\"Unleash the Berserkers\\" follows Boone's journey from total conviction in the use of Berserkers to realizing the importance of finding more ethical and controlled ways of protecting humanity. The movie highlights the often perilous line between innovation and humanity's duty to protect itself without causing irreparable harm.

I have a new situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there  overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.  But I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  What is an answer for this question: Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move faster? The answer to this question is:","output":"Group Jones' cans had the air molecules inside move faster. This is because they did not vent their cans before heating them over the campfire. As the cans heated up, the air molecules inside gained more kinetic energy, causing them to move faster and impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. This buildup of pressure ultimately led to the cans exploding. In contrast, Group George properly vented their cans, allowing the pressure to escape and preventing the buildup of fast-moving air molecules inside their cans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response.

The film was a major box-office success in Germany and gained widespread praise for its humor and performances. Regarding your question about what working for Anna is like, it's important to understand that Ludo and Anna have a history together since childhood, so their past animosity creates a challenging work environment for Ludo. As a reporter sentenced to 300 hours of social work in Anna's nursery school, Ludo finds himself in a difficult and humbling situation. Working for Anna is like \\"walking through Hell barefoot\\" because Ludo is used to a more glamorous lifestyle filled with celebrities, scandals and the fast-paced environment that comes with being a paparazzi. It's a new and unfamiliar world for him, going from the spotlight to a community-oriented setting where children's welfare is the main focus. Moreover, Anna's no-nonsense and strong-willed personality clashes with Ludo's cavalier attitude.  However, this experience of working under Anna's supervision becomes a transformative journey for Ludo. As he adapts to his new surroundings and gets to know Anna better, he discovers valuable life lessons. Over time, their initial animosity fades and both characters mature through their interactions, subsequently leading towards romantic feelings and self-growth. In summary, while working for Anna is initially difficult and hellish for Ludo, the experience eventually leads to personal growth, self-discovery, and a deepening connection with Anna. The movie demonstrates that even in challenging situations, people can learn and grow together, finding unexpected happiness and love."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Title: Half Nelson Movie plot: Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) is a young inner-city high school teacher whose ideals wither and die in the face of reality. Day after day in his shabby Brooklyn classroom, he somehow finds the energy to inspire his 13 and 14-years-old to examine everything from civil rights to the civil war with a new enthusiasm. Rejecting the standard curriculum in favor of an edgier approach, Dan teaches his students how change workson both a historical and personal scaleand how to think for themselves.Though Dan is brilliant, dynamic and in control of the classroom, he spends his time outside school on the edge of consciousness. Early in the film we see Dan smoking crack in a school locker room after he coaches the school's girls basketball team. While there, one of his players, Drey (Shareeka Epps) catches him getting high. As the plot moves forward, we learn little about how or why Dan got involved with drugs. We find that a former girlfriend has successfully gone through drug rehab, and that the Dunne family has fissures of its own. But Fleck primarily sets moods throughout the film, leaving large ellipses for the viewer to fill in, rather than directly illuminate Dan's story.Drey's troubles are more plainly spelled out.

Drey's lack of proper adult supervision make her a target for Frank's operation.The tension in the film comes from Drey's attempts to save Dan from the consequences of his drug habit, and Dan's efforts to keep Drey from following in her brother Mike's footsteps.

Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day.  The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber   was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed \\"together\\". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket. Shortly before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, he prayed for God's protection and promised God that if he made it home, he would make sure his family attended church every Sunday. Well, he made it home and he kept that promise. I cannot remember a Sunday when Dad did not take my mother, my siblings and me to church -- even when we were away on vacation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Police and prosecutors in Baltimore have launched investigations after being alerted to body camera footage that the public defender’s office says shows an officer planting drugs.      One officer has been suspended and two others have been placed on administrative duty, police said. Police said they have not reached any conclusions as to the conduct depicted in the video. Other cases in which the officers are involved are now under review as well, police and prosecutors said.      The public defender’s office, which released the footage, said it was recorded by an officer during a drug arrest in January. It shows the officer placing a soup can, which holds a plastic bag, into a trash-strewn lot.      That portion of the footage was recorded automatically, before the officer activated the camera. After placing the can, the officer walks to the street, and flips his camera on.      “I’m gonna go check here,” the officer says. He returns to the lot and picks up the soup can, removing the plastic bag, which is filled with white capsules.      Police cameras have a feature that saves the 30 seconds of video before activation, but without audio. When the officer is first in the alley, there is no audio for the first 30 seconds.      The public defender’s office flagged the video for prosecutors last week, prompting prosecutors to drop the heroin possession charge against the man arrested.      The man, unable to post 50,000 bail, had been in jail since January, according to attorney Deborah Levi, who is leading a new effort to track police misconduct cases for the public defender’s office.      Levi said prosecutors called the officer just days later as a witness in another case — without disclosing the allegations of misconduct on the officer’s part to the defense attorney in that case.      “You can’t try a case with that guy and not tell anyone about it,” Levi said.      The Baltimore state’s attorney’s office defended its handling of the case in a statement late Wednesday. After being alerted to the video, the office said, it “immediately implemented established protocols to not only refer this matter to the internal affairs division of the Baltimore Police Department but began identifying active cases involving these officers.”      It did not dispute Levi’s claim that prosecutors had put the officer back on the stand in another criminal case after being alerted to the video.      Melba Saunders, a spokeswoman for the office, said prosecutors are looking into the video, which she called “troubling.” The office did not respond to questions about the case and its handling of it.      The footage, which garnered national attention Wednesday, comes as prosecutors and police continue to deal with the fallout from the federal indictment of seven members of an elite police gun squad.      Those officers are accused of robbing citizens, filing false court paperwork and claiming overtime they had not earned.      Prosecutors have since dropped dozens of cases that depended on those officers’ testimony.      The officer in the body camera footage was identified by the public defender’s office as Officer Richard Pinheiro.      Pinheiro could not be reached for comment Wednesday. City records show he was hired by the department in 2011, and in 2016 earned a salary of 62,676, with a net income of 67,570. Officers in Baltimore routinely earn overtime pay.      Two other officers seen in the video observing Pinheiro are Officers Hovhannes Simonyan and Jamal Brunson, according to public defender and court records obtained by The Baltimore Sun.      The public defender working the case first alerted prosecutors last week, the public defender’s office said. Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said police only learned of the video “over the last day or so.”      Davis said his department has “not reached any conclusions, because that’s what an investigation is for.” But he noted — and released portions of — other body-worn camera videos from the incident in question that he said provided “other perspectives” than the one provided in the video flagged by the public defender’s office.      “To let that initial video that was released by the public defender's office stand all by its lonesome I think doesn't paint as clear of a picture as we would like to offer to the community right now,” he said.      The Baltimore Police Department released multiple body-worn camera videos from a January drug arrest that allegedly show an officer placing a bag of drugs in a trash-strewn lot. (Baltimore Police Department) The Baltimore Police Department released multiple body-worn camera videos from a January drug arrest that allegedly show an officer placing a bag of drugs in a trash-strewn lot. (Baltimore Police Department) SEE MORE VIDEOS      Davis said officers were conducting surveillance of an area known for drug dealing when they observed an exchange. The department released three additional videos: one of a traffic stop of the alleged buyer of drugs in the exchange; one of the arrest of the suspect of the case in a convenience store; and a third of multiple officers searching the backyard lot featured in the video flagged by the public defender’s office.      Davis said the officers found drugs in each of the other three videos: on both the buyer, on the seller, and in the backyard. The drugs found in the backyard in the third video were in a knotted bag, he said.      “If I'm engaged in the distribution of drugs, I'll probably have two bags: one with a knot at the top, and one that's unknotted at the top that allows me access to the drugs inside the bag so I can easily retrieve them and then sell or distribute them,” Davis said. “So when these experienced detectives found a bag with a knot at the top, that suggested to them that there's probably an un-knotted bag nearby, because the drug dealers won't unknot and then re-knot a bag every time they go retrieve drugs from it to distribute.”      Davis said police were investigating whether the video flagged by the public defender’s office showed the officer “re-creating” his discovery of the second, un-knotted bag of drugs.      “It's certainly a possibility that we're looking into, to see if the officers in fact replaced drugs that they had already discovered in order to document their discovery with their body-worn cameras on,” he said.      Lt. Gene Ryan, president of the local police union that represents rank-and-file officers, urged people not to “jump to conclusions.”      “Everyone needs to take a deep breath, take a step back, and let the investigation run its course,” he said. “First impression, it doesn’t look good. But that’s not the complete investigation. There’s going to be a lot more done to get to the bottom of what really happened.”      The public defender’s office said the state’s attorney’s office needs to do more in response to the discovery of the video. It said in a statement that the officer seen handling the plastic bag in the video is a witness in 53 other active cases. The other two officers in the video also are listed as witnesses in pending cases, the office said. ||||| (CNN) New video casts a glaring light on Baltimore police practices as the department and city grapple with a distrustful public and record-setting violent crime.      The video reportedly shows what happened during what might otherwise have been a typical drug bust on January 24. Released by the Office of the Public Defender, the video purports to show a Baltimore police officer planting evidence at the scene of a drug arrest.      The Baltimore Police Department has launched an investigation and held a news conference releasing other videos while offering a timeline of events.      Seeking to allay public concern, Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis called the video \\"a serious allegation of police misconduct,\\" saying, \\"Our investigation will ultimately determine what happened, it will identify if any criminal misconduct took place, any administrative procedures were violated, and we're determined to get to the bottom of it.\\"      The video, recorded on police body-worn cameras, shows the officer placing a plastic bag into a food can, then partially hiding it under a piece of debris. Thirty seconds later the audio begins, and the officer says, \\"I'm going to check here. Hold on,\\" as his colleagues laugh. The officer then gives a cursory look at other items in the debris-strewn lot and appears to stumble onto the drugs in the can.      \\"Yo!\\" the officer shouts at his colleagues as he holds up the small cellophane bag containing several pills. One of his colleagues shouts back, \\"What's up?\\" The video ends a few seconds later.      As the officer searches the lot for evidence, a colleague can be heard saying, \\"Is that 30?\\" -- possibly a reference to the way the body-worn cameras operate. They record 30 seconds of video without sound before an officer actively turns on the camera, according to the manufacturer Axon. Referred to as a buffer, it's meant to capture crucial evidence that might occur just before an officer activates his camera.      Davis said of the video, \\"I saw video footage of officers apparently placing evidence and recovering evidence in a way that initially based on what I saw (is), very narrowly, inconsistent with the way police officers do business.\\"      One officer in the video has been suspended, and two others were placed on administrative duty pending an investigation by the department's Office of Professional Responsibility.      Police said the arrest involved a drug sale that led to the discovery of two bags of heroin in gel capsule form. One bag was tied off, and the second was opened and recovered by officers at the scene.      \\"It's certainly a possibility that we're looking into to see if the officers in fact replaced drugs that they had already discovered in order to document their discovery with their body-worn cameras on,\\" the police commissioner said.      The public defender's office said it turned the video over to the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office, which is responsible for prosecuting those charged with crimes.      In a statement, the public defender said the \\"prosecutor in the case claimed to be 'appalled' by the video and dropped the charges in the case.\\" The State's Attorney's Office added in a statement, \\"Our office immediately implemented established protocols to not only refer this matter to the Internal Affairs Division of the Baltimore Police Department but began identifying active cases involving these officers.\\"      The public defender said the officer in question is a witness in 53 open cases and was used recently as a witness by a prosecutor despite knowledge about the behavior captured on video.      The State's Attorney's Office did not respond to questions about why the officer in question had testified as a witness in at least one subsequent trial.      In a statement, Debbie Katz Levi, who leads the public defender's Special Litigation Section, said, \\"Officer misconduct has been a pervasive issue at the Baltimore Police Department, which is exacerbated by the lack of accountability. We have long supported the use of police body cameras to help identify police misconduct, but such footage is meaningless if prosecutors continue to rely on these officers, especially if they do so without disclosing their bad acts.\\"      Gene Ryan, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Baltimore's main police union, urged patience. \\"I'd love for everyone not to jump to conclusions\\" he said, \\"and wait for the outcome of the investigation. It will all come out.\\"      Baltimore police have been rocked by controversy since the death of Freddie Gray in April 2015. Six officers were charged in connection with his death. The trials ended in either a hung jury, or officers were found not guilty or had charges dropped after the state's attorney was unable to proceed with prosecution.      Deaths due to gun violence in the city are up 21% this year over 2016, with 186 killed so far, according to Baltimore police. If that pace continues, the city is on track to set a record.      Since 2011, Baltimore has paid out more than 13 million to settle lawsuits alleging police misconduct. In April, a federal judge approved a consent decree after a Justice Department report found a wide racial disparity in the way the Baltimore police treat citizens.      This latest episode is another blow for the city.      \\"There is nothing that deteriorates the trust of any community more than thinking for one second that uniformed police officers and police officers in general would plant evidence of crimes on citizens,\\" Davis said. \\"That's as serious as it gets.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Baltimore police are investigating an incident in which an officer's body camera appears to have recorded him planting drugs at a crime scene.

The crammed contents are linked ponderously in a long, warning movie sermon that has authority but little power. 4. Heston may as well be screaming about Soylent Green, but damn if he doesn't make for one hell of an inspiring leader. 5. DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form. The eyes of the onlooker are filled with spectacle. Emotional tug is sometimes lacking. 6. Still the definitive depiction of the Exodus in the popular imagination. 7. Stirring, even if it's as much showbiz as Bible. 8. Bank holiday afternoon fare it might be, but DeMille's remake of his 1923 silent is a marvellous epic of the kind they don't make any more. 9. A great big wallow, sublime hootchy-kootchy hokum, peppered with lightning that does automatic writing and an unsurpassed homage to the joys of jello. 10. With a running time of nearly four hours, Cecil B. De Mille's last feature and most extravagant blockbuster is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects, but it isn't boring for a minute. Based on these individual reviews, what is the critic consensus?","output":"The critic consensus for Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 film, The Ten Commandments, is that it is an extravagant, visually spectacular epic that serves as a definitive depiction of the Exodus story in popular imagination. The film features a strong performance by Charlton Heston as an inspiring leader, despite some melodramatic and unintentionally humorous moments. While DeMille's approach leans more towards spectacle and conventional storytelling, lacking emotional depth at times, the movie remains an entertaining and stirring experience that stands out as a classic of its time. Overall, it is a marvellous and grand example of an epic that is not boring despite its long running time."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who gets fed on by someone with vampire fangs?  Peter Loew is a driven literary agent and an example of the stereotypical narcissistic and greedy yuppie of the 1980s: he works all day and club hops at night, with little in his life but alcohol, one night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige. However, he is slowly going insane and sees a therapist frequently; it is during these sessions that his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist. After he takes home a girl he met in a club named Jackie, a bat flies in through his window, scaring them both. At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the struggle with the bat aroused him, and after visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day, he ditches her, and she leaves an angry message on his phone. Loew meets Rachel at a night club, and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals vampire fangs and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is changing into a vampire. He stares into a bathroom mirror and fails to see his reflection, he wears dark sunglasses during the day, and, when his \\"fangs\\" fail to develop, he purchases a pair of cheap plastic vampire teeth. All the while, Rachel visits him nightly to feed on his blood. Shortly after, Loew experiences mood swings and calls Jackie back apologetically, asking to meet her at a bar. As he is about to leave, a jealous Rachel appears and beckons him back inside. A dejected Jackie eventually leaves the bar and leaves an angry note on his door asking him to leave her alone.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? oftentimes funny , yet","output":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"oftentimes funny, yet\\" is generally positive but somewhat incomplete. This sentiment analysis will provide a detailed explanation based on the components of the sentence and the context in which the words are used. First, let's break down the sentence: 1. \\"oftentimes\\" - This adverb suggests that the description applies frequently, but not necessarily always. It indicates that the reviewer observed the discussed element multiple times. 2. \\"funny\\" - The adjective \\"funny\\" implies a positive sentiment; it means the movie has a sense of humor or comedic elements that are intended to amuse the audience. This usually suggests that the audience could expect to laugh or at least be entertained by the movie's comedic aspects. 3. \\"yet\\" - This conjunction is primarily used to introduce a contrasting element or idea. In this context, it suggests that there is a notable exception or additional point the reviewer wants to make, which may be positive, negative, or neutral. Since the sentence is incomplete, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact sentiment. However, based on the words used, the overall sentiment leans towards positive due to the description of the movie being \\"oftentimes funny.\\" The adverb \\"oftentimes\\" implies that the humor is frequent enough to make a positive impression on the reviewer. The conjunction \\"yet,\\" followed by the absence of additional information, introduces an element of uncertainty or anticipation. It serves as a teaser, sparking curiosity about the contrasting point that the reviewer wants to make. This possibly indicates that there might be some mixed feelings about the movie or the reviewer may bring balance to their opinion by stating something less favorable in continuation. However, without the rest of the sentence, it is difficult to provide a definitive sentiment analysis.  In conclusion, the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"oftentimes funny, yet\\" is generally positive (due to the use of \\"funny\\"), but it remains somewhat incomplete and inconclusive without the additional context. The use of the conjunction \\"yet\\" suggests that there may be more to the reviewer's opinion than what has been revealed in this part of the sentence, leaving room for further analysis when the complete statement is known."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We’ve got Eric Holder and the Department of Justice trying to stand in the schoolhouse door to prevent minority kids, low-income kids, kids who haven’t had access to a great education the chance to go to better schools.” The “schoolhouse door” language isn’t just creative prose, its an apparent reference to the famous “stand in the schoolhouse door” by segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace, during which he physically attempted to block black students from integrating the University of Alabama. The Department of Justice is seeking greater federal oversight over the voucher program. According to the Department of Justice press office, the book was sent to Jindal with a passage on Wallace’s schoolhouse door stand flagged for good measure. “This should help the Governor brush up on his history for the next time he invokes the civil rights movement,” DOJ Press Secretary Kevin Lewis said in a statement. Here are photos from the mailing, courtesy of DOJ: (Department of Justice Press Office) In response, Jindal tweeted out his rebuttal: Dear AG Holder.Thx for your note.

Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled.  Question: suppose lava chambers are aggravated with build up pressure happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"The scenario you describe involves lava chambers with a build-up of pressure, which seems to be a geological or volcanic situation. It is not directly related to the respiratory system of the human body, which consists of breathing in oxygen and carbon dioxide being exhaled. However, to answer your question more comprehensively, I'll examine any potential indirect effects such a situation could have on the respiratory process and the second effect mentioned, which is the division of inhaled air between the two lungs via the bronchial tubes. First, let's consider the possibility of volcanic eruptions due to the aggravated lava chambers. Such an eruption could release large amounts of gases, including sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and other particles into the atmosphere. These gases could have an impact on the air quality, which in turn could affect the breathing process. The accumulation of these gases in the atmosphere near an eruption site could make it more difficult for people to breathe in oxygen. In this situation, the oxygen supply in the surrounding air might be reduced, which could lead to a decreased amount of oxygen being available for the body during the inhalation process. Consequently, the air carried to the lungs by the windpipe and bronchial tubes could contain less oxygen than usual. This would result in less oxygenated blood being supplied to the body, making it more challenging for cells to filter out carbon dioxide efficiently. In this case, the perturbation would have a negative effect, meaning \\"less\\" oxygen would be available to the body. Furthermore, the presence of volcanic particles, such as ash, could cause irritations or obstructions in the respiratory system. This could lead to inflammation or difficulties in circulating the air in the bronchial tubes, which might further worsen the already reduced oxygen supply to the body. Taking all these factors into consideration, one could argue that aggravated lava chambers with built-up pressure could indirectly affect the respiratory system. It may result in \\"less\\" oxygen being brought to the body due to the poor air quality and potential respiratory irritations caused by volcanic emissions and ash particles. However, it is essential to note that this outcome would largely depend on the proximity of the individual to the volcanic activity, as well as other environmental factors affecting air quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In these two sentences, \\"make\\" has slightly different meanings, but both times, it tells us about something being created or forming. In the first sentence, \\"One swallow does not a summer make,\\" it's like saying that just because one swallow (a type of bird) shows up, it doesn't automatically create or turn the whole season into summer. It's a way of saying that one thing doesn't change everything around it. In the second sentence, \\"This makes the third infraction,\\" it means that whatever just happened has created or formed the third infraction (like when someone breaks a rule).

As an adult in 2035, he works as a bartender at a Berlin strip club owned by Maksim and dates cocktail waitress Naadirah. She confides in her friend Luba that she has not told Leo about her past or her desperate need for money. After Stuart, a rowdy customer, sexually harasses Naadirah, Leo assaults him. Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery. Stuart returns to the strip club and taunts Leo, leading to a fight and Maksim firing Leo. When he's unable to contact Naadirah, Leo asks Luba for help, but Luba refuses.

He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a safe deposit box in ZÃ¼rich. Upon landing, the man heads to investigate the box. Arriving at the bank, the man finds the box contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use the name on the American passport, Jason Bourne. After Bourne's departure, a bank employee contacts Operation Treadstone, a CIA black ops program. Treadstone's head, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), activates three agents to take down Bourne: Castel (Nicky Naude), Manheim (Russell Levy), and the Professor (Clive Owen), while also issuing alerts to local police to capture Bourne. Meanwhile, CIA Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) contacts Conklin about a failed assassination attempt against exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Conklin promises Abbott that he will deal with the Treadstone agent who failed.

To answer the question appropriately, we need to explore the history of early Marvel heroes and identify the group that collectively represents the most popular ones. In the 1940s, Marvel Comics, then known as Timely Comics, produced a triumvirate of iconic superheroes: Captain America, the Human Torch, and Namor the Sub-Mariner. These characters were the most popular early Marvel heroes and were collectively and colloquially known as \\"The Big Three\\" or the \\"Invaders.\\" Captain America, created in 1941 by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, was a symbol of patriotism during World War II and fought against the Axis Powers alongside his sidekick, Bucky Barnes. Captain America has remained one of Marvel's most significant characters through multiple iterations, including the recent portrayal by Chris Evans in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Human Torch, created in 1939 by Carl Burgos, predates Captain America and was one of the first superheroes ever published by Timely Comics, which later became Marvel Comics. This version of the Human Torch was an android named Jim Hammond who could engulf himself in flames and fly. Namor the Sub-Mariner, created by Bill Everett in 1939, is a half-human, half-Atlantean mutant who rules the underwater city of Atlantis. Namor possesses enhanced strength, endurance, and the ability to fly using the small wings on his ankles. These three iconic characters formed the core of Timely Comics' superhero line-up and were later revived in Marvel Comics continuity during the Silver Age. They are the most popular early Marvel heroes and collectively known as \\"The Big Three\\" or the \\"Invaders.\\" In contrast, the Whizzer, Miss America, the Destroyer, the original Vision, and the Angel mentioned in the sentence are important but secondary characters in Marvel's early history, and they do not address the question asked directly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: How would you describe Kendall? Answer:","output":"Kendall can be described as an individual who may have a tendency to prioritize nonessential or trivial purchases over more practical or necessary ones, given the context shared. When it comes to personal finance, people have different habits and priorities, and it appears that Kendall is inclined to spend her allowance on items that don't hold much value in terms of usefulness, longevity, or investment. Such behavior may stem from various factors, including the influence of consumer culture, peer pressure, emotional spending, or a lack of financial literacy. One could describe Kendall as impulsive, as she might make unplanned or spontaneous purchases without weighing the potential benefits, drawbacks, or alternative spending options. Impulsive behavior may prevent her from establishing long-term saving goals or building an emergency fund, which are essential aspects of a healthy financial life. Another word that could be used to describe Kendall is materialistic. This characteristic highlights her preference for acquiring tangible possessions, even if they serve no practical purpose. A materialistic mindset might influence her to seek temporary satisfaction and happiness through material goods, instead of focusing on intangible values such as relationships, personal growth, and experiences. Additionally, Kendall can be described as lacking budgeting skills. The absence of a well-planned budget can lead to excessive spending on non-essential items, leaving little to no resources for more crucial needs. This lack of financial discipline may eventually result in difficulties in managing personal finances and lead to potential debts. Finally, it's essential to consider that Kendall's spending habits might be a reflection of her age, social circle, or personal preferences. Teenagers and young adults, especially those who are yet to be exposed to real-life financial responsibilities, are more likely to spend their money on fun and indulgent items. It's crucial not to be overly judgmental or critical but rather focus on guiding and educating Kendall about the importance of financial responsibility, saving, and thoughtful spending to help her develop more sustainable financial habits in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A law adopted by the new government on October 20, 1789 authorized the Garde Nationale to raise the red flag in the event of a riot, to signal that the Garde would imminently intervene. During a demonstration on the Champs de Mars on July 17, 1791, the Garde Nationale fired on the crowd, killed up to fifty people. The government was denounced by the more radical revolutionaries. In the words of his famous hymn, the Marseillaise, Rouget de Lisle wrote: \\"Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!\\" (Contre nous de la tyrannie, l'entendard sanglant est leve). Beginning in 1790, the most radical revolutionaries adopted the red flag themselves, to symbolize the blood of those killed in the demonstrations, and to call for the repression of those they considered counter-revolutionary.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Question: Analyze the significance of the red flag as a political symbol during the French Revolution, and discuss how its connotation evolved from representing the Garde Nationale's intervention in riots to being embraced by radical revolutionaries. Consider the events of the Champs de Mars demonstration and the influence of the Marseillaise hymn along with the motivations of the revolutionaries who adopted the symbol. Answer: The red flag emerged as a political symbol during the French Revolution, primarily after the fall of Bastille. Initially, the red flag was adopted by the new government as a symbol for the Garde Nationale, a militia created to maintain order during the revolution. On October 20, 1789, a law was enacted, allowing the Garde Nationale to raise the red flag as a signal of imminent intervention in times of riots or disturbances. The Champs de Mars demonstration on July 17, 1791, marked a turning point in the perception of the red flag. During this event, the Garde Nationale fired upon the crowd, resulting in the deaths of up to fifty individuals. This violent crackdown led to a wave of criticism and denunciation from the more radical elements among the revolutionaries. As the revolution progressed, the Marseillaise hymn, composed by Rouget de Lisle, became an anthem of the revolutionary cause. The lyrics of the hymn criticized the oppressive tactics of the government, particularly the use of the red flag as a symbol of tyranny: \\"Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!\\" (Contre nous de la tyrannie, l'entendard sanglant est leve). This sentiment resonated with the most radical revolutionaries, who began to reinterpret the red flag as a symbol of protest and defiance. Beginning in 1790, these radical revolutionaries adopted the red flag, embracing it as a representation of the bloodshed suffered by the demonstrators and martyrs of the revolution. It became a rallying point for calls for further repression of those deemed counter-revolutionary. This evolution in the symbolism of the red flag demonstrated the fluidity of revolutionary symbols and the way in which political factions sought to claim and redefine powerful symbols for their own purposes. Consequently, the red flag transformed from a symbol of potential state violence against the populace to a symbol of the revolutionaries' commitment to their cause and their demands for justice for the victims of government repression."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray  their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel  against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What form became the primary motif of Moore's sculpture?, using the article: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The primary motif of Moore's sculpture became direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. This technique was influenced by primitivism and the works of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, and Frank Dobson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As I've mentioned in other reviews...  I am picky as hell when it comes to eating.  There aren't many things I like and once I hit upon things I do like I will happily eat them over and over and over ...  much to the dismay of my husband.  So we're currently living on the sah'side right around the corner from this place.  We've been here maybe 3 weeks...  eaten here 5 or 6 times.  I love the hummus with tzitziki (sp) sauce and cucumbers on whole wheat pita.  Probably not the most normal combination but I am weird that way and could eat this every night for the rest of my life.  The turkey is also really, really good.  They serve it hot and it tastes just like thanksgiving turkey, not lunch meat.  Yummy!  Pitas are always nice and squishy.  I hate hard pitas.  It's kinda like subway but different enough that it's a nice change of pace.  The only thing I don't like about it - and the reason my husband won't actually consent to eat there every night - is they have no kid's menu.  There is a sign inside that says \\"Ask about our kid's menu!\\" but when we asked, the guy looked at us blankly and said \\"Just order something with cheese, or something.\\"  The problem with this is my son has a habit of eating the inside of his sandwich and that's all.  So paying full price for a sandwich he only eats the inside of doesn't sit well with me.  If your kid actually eats the sandwich it's not a big deal.  The place isn't exactly kid-unfriendly, it's just not budget friendly if your kid won't eat it all.    Love this place! Choose the sentiment of this review? Pick from: A). negative; B). positive;","output":"B). positive This review is mostly positive because the person loves the food items like hummus with tzitziki sauce and cucumbers on whole wheat pita, and turkey at this place and has eaten here 5-6 times in just 3 weeks. Although there's a small issue that there's no kid's menu and the child is unable to finish a whole sandwich, that doesn't seem to affect the overall love for this place. If we look at options, A is wrong because 'negative' means the person didn't like the place or their experience was bad, but here the person is praising the food and saying they could eat it every day. So, that definitely doesn't sound negative.

The wife of actor Andrew Sachs condemned the BBC last night for bringing Jonathan Ross back to  Radio 2 for the first time since he left the BBC following Sachsgate scandal. Melody Sachs said it was a ‘slap in the face’ to give the disgraced presenter a job on the same station on which he insulted her husband six years ago. Ross has been hired to provide holiday cover for Steve Wright’s afternoon music and chat show at the end of the month. 'It's highly inappropriate and disgusting': Melody Sachs, pictured with her husband Andrew Sachs, condemned the BBC last night for bringing Jonathan Ross back to Radio 2. He will be paid an estimated £4,000 to host four three-hour programmes between August 26 and 29. Last night Mrs Sachs, 79, said: ‘It’s highly inappropriate and I think it’s disgusting.’ In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave a series of obscene messages on Mr Sachs’s answerphone. The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the 84-year-old actor’s granddaughter and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls. Brand later resigned and Ross was suspended for 12 weeks, later moving to ITV. The BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom. Incident: Jonathan Ross (right) and Russell Brand are pictured insulting Mr Sachs on the BBC's Radio 2 show. Although Ross, 53, has said he feels ‘immense regret’, the Sachs family have refused to forgive him and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career. Mrs Sachs added: ‘I’m so surprised that the BBC has welcomed him back. I’m amazed that they could do such a thing. It’s like a slap in the face for us, especially after Andrew spent so much of his working life with the BBC writing, acting and directing. It’s very sad and thoughtless and disrespectful.’ It is the first time since he left the BBC that Ross has been allowed back on Radio 2, although he has appeared on one-off TV. On Monday he appeared as a guest on Radio 4 panel show Just A Minute. Criticism: Tory MP Philip Davies (left) has also criticised the decision to allow Ross (right) back on the airwaves. Last night Tory MP Philip Davies also criticised the decision to allow Ross back on the airwaves. He said: ‘My view is that what he did was completely and utterly unacceptable. He doesn’t appear to have accepted that, and until he does I don’t think the BBC should employ him.’ Ross was never fired from the BBC. Instead he chose to leave in 2010 after the corporation decided not to renew his £18million contract. He later claimed the scandal had made him a ‘better person’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Jonathan is an experienced and talented broadcaster … [who] is returning for this one-off stint of holiday cover for Steve Wright. There are no plans to bring him  back permanently.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"This is an article about a woman named Melody Sachs who is unhappy with a decision made by the BBC.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information:  - Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809  October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.  - Supernatural fiction or supernaturalist fiction is a genre of literary and media fiction exploiting or requiring as plot devices or themes some contradictions of the commonplace natural world and materialist assumptions about it.   - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - A film genre (or ) is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.). Most theories of film genre are borrowed from literary genre criticism. The basic genres include fiction and documentary, from which subgenres have emerged, such as docufiction and docudrama. Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \\"Evil Dead\\" films. Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film.  - Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi. It is a parody sequel to the 1981 horror film \\"The Evil Dead\\". The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration, \\"Crimewave\\"), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.  - Abraham \\"Bram\\" Stoker (8 November 1847  20 April 1912) was an Irish author, best known today for his 1897 Gothic novel \\"Dracula\\". During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, which Irving owned.  - Darkman is a 1990 American superhero film directed and co-written by Sam Raimi. It is based on a short story Raimi wrote that paid homage to Universal's horror films of the 1930s. The film stars Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake, a scientist who is attacked and left for dead by a ruthless mobster, Robert Durant (Larry Drake), after his girlfriend, an attorney (Frances McDormand), runs afoul of a corrupt developer (Colin Friels).  - In works of art, macabre is the quality of having a grim or ghastly atmosphere. Macabre works emphasize the details and symbols of death. The term also refers to works particularly gruesome in nature.  - Horror film is a film genre that seeks to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on their fears. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres.  - Scott Spiegel (born December 24, 1957) is an American screenwriter, film director, producer and actor. He is best known for co-writing the screenplay for the movie \\"Evil Dead II\\" with longtime friend, film director Sam Raimi, with whom he attended Wylie E. Groves High School in Birmingham, Michigan. Spiegel played the role of Scotty in Raimi's \\"Within the Woods\\", which served as a precursor to \\"The Evil Dead\\".  - The Evil Dead is a 1981 American supernatural horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi and executive produced by Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who also stars alongside Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. The film focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an audiotape that releases a legion of demons and spirits, members of the group suffer from demonic possession, leading to increasingly gory mayhem. Raimi and the cast produced the short film \\"Within the Woods\\" as a \\"prototype\\" to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US90,000 to produce \\"The Evil Dead\\". The film was shot on location in a remote cabin located in Morristown, Tennessee, in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the majority of the cast and crew.  - Fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that occurs in certain types of organisms, which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a specific stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis.  In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning. Thus fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a phobia.  - Within the Woods is a 1978 horror short film written, directed and produced by Sam Raimi. Raimi drew inspiration from his earlier short film \\"Clockwork\\", deciding to produce a \\"prototype\\" horror film to help build the interest of potential investors. Raimi cast his friends Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as the two protagonists and produced the film for 1600. Shot on location in a remote cabin in the woods, production was a difficult process because of the low budget. Several of the special effects presented in the film were done in a severely low budget manner, some of which were improvised on set. The film centers around demonic possession and mysterious forces originating from the woods.  - Clockwork is a 1978 American short horror film directed by Sam Raimi , starring Scott Spiegel and Cheryl Guttridge .  - Birmingham is a city in Oakland County of the U.S. state of Michigan and a suburb of Detroit.

I read this background article the other day: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms.  I am facing a new situation today: A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline? The answer to this question is:","output":"Electron shielding is higher in Sampline. Since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, it has more electron shells. More electron shells result in a higher degree of electron shielding, which makes the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outermost electrons lower.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The formula is D=w2+l2{displaystyle D={sqrt {w^{2}+l^{2}}}}, where D{displaystyle D} equals the length of the rectangle’s diagonal, l{displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle, and w{displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle.  This method will only work if you are given the length of the diagonal and the length of the side of the rectangle. You might also see the formula written as D=w2+h2{displaystyle D={sqrt {w^{2}+h^{2}}}}, where h{displaystyle h} equals the height of the rectangle and is used instead of length. The variables l{displaystyle l} and h{displaystyle h} refer to the same measurement. Make sure you substitute for the correct variables. For example, if you are trying to find the width of a rectangle that has a diagonal length of 5 centimeters, and a side length of 4 centimeters, your formula will look like this: 5=w2+42{displaystyle 5={sqrt {w^{2}+4^{2}}}} You need to do this to get rid of the square root sign, which makes isolating the width variable easier. For example:5=w2+42{displaystyle 5={sqrt {w^{2}+4^{2}}}}52=w2+42{displaystyle 5^{2}=w^{2}+4^{2}}25=w2+16{displaystyle 25=w^{2}+16} To do this, you need to subtract the squared length from each side of the equation. For example, in the equation 25=16+w2{displaystyle 25=16+w^{2}}, you would subtract 16 from each side.25=16+w2{displaystyle 25=16+w^{2}}9=w2{displaystyle 9=w^{2}} To do this, you need to find the square root of each side of the equation. For example:9=w2{displaystyle {sqrt {9}}={sqrt {w^{2}}}}3=w{displaystyle 3=w} Don’t forget to include the unit of measurement.

POST : I had a psychiatrist appointment in san jose and cyrus/aia wanted to go to a dollar store to shop. I suggested that they should come with me because the 99 had way better produce and we could get some pho or something. Cyrus was adamant about getting in n out. Aia and I agreed on noodles. I had no objections to doing both. Before my appointment I had to mess with my printer to get it to work so we leave a little late and I apologize to aia because we couldn't drop her resume off somewhere she wanted to work. On the way, Aia discovers she can't do her reading on the 17 northbound because of all of the movement. She tells me the reading is due at 7. My psych appointment takes an hour as predicted and ended up being extremely emotionally taxing. (I did tell them 30 minutes to an hour before we left) Cyrus and Aia apparently go to in n out during such. When they come back with my car 15 minutes after my appointment ended, Aia tells me she left room for noodles. So I figure, yeah let's go get noodles. I drive us to a pho place 15 minutes away and when we get there, cyrus says we should leave. Aia complains that it's expensive and that I said pho is 6 to 8.(I'm from LA) It was really 10 to 11 and that turns out to be average for San Jose. Therefore, she is not eating. Cyrus offers to pay for her meal but she refuses. At this point, I'm hungry and have a massive headache so I decide to eat. Cyrus asks me if I can take it to go and I say no because rice noodles go bad pretty fast. Im pretty disappointed that im eating alone here but I eat as fast as possible without throwing up so we can go. It was a pretty big bowl so it took like half an hour. We go to the 99 15 minutes away to do our grocery shopping and we head back home to santa cruz. On the way back, we encounter a ton of traffic and I apologize to Aia again. From here, Cyrus starts exploding at me saying that I asked them to come with me and that we never made plans to get noodles. He says I'm a dick for eating the noodles when no one else was eating and when he said I should take it to go/we should leave that should have been my cue to just not eat and that it essentially translates to we dont have time for this. Eventually I stop listening because I have a huge problem with people yelling in general and they both know this. I tell them that if we didn't have time, they should tell me there isn't time instead of just saying we should leave because I cant read their minds. (Make your needs be known/be direct) They just claim that I'm flipping it on them and that I'm saying they should have done more. Unbeknownst to me, Aia just wasnt doing her homework and absolutely needed to be at home to read something on her phone that was in her pocket. I was going to apologize to Aia about this whole thing, but something about being yelled at and insulted for an hour by her boyfriend made me not want to. At this point, my medication wears off and I just start putting minimal effort into the conversation by just making snarky semantic arguments to push him off more.

Gichin Funakoshi was born on November 10, 1868 (refer to Karate-d, My Way of Life by Gichin Funakoshi), the year of the Meiji Restoration, in Shuri, Okinawa, to a low-rank Rykyan Pechin and originally had the family name Tominakoshi. Funakoshi was born prematurely. His father's name was Gisu. After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of Ank Azato, a karate and Jigen-ry master who would soon become his first karate teacher.  Funakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the abolition of the Japanese topknot, and this meant he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school, despite having passed the entrance examination. Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Azato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Azato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank Azato.  - , abbreviated as or , is a Japanese university located in Minato, Tokyo.

Text:  Greater use of oil and other fossil fuels causes more pollution. A:","output":"Based on the given text, when more cars are added to the road, the pollution levels increase. This is because most cars run on fossil fuels like oil, which release harmful pollutants when burned to create energy. As the statement points out, \\"Greater use of oil and other fossil fuels causes more pollution.\\" When there are more cars on the road, it means more fuel is being consumed. Fossil fuels, such as gasoline or diesel, are derived from oil and are widely used for powering vehicles. When these fuels are combusted in car engines, they release greenhouse gases, particulate matter, and other harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Some of the most common pollutants from car exhaust include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants contribute to air pollution, which can negatively affect human health, the environment, and climate change. As the number of vehicles on the road increases, so does the consumption of fossil fuels and the production of these harmful emissions. In addition to worsening air quality, more cars on the road can lead to increased traffic congestion, which further amplifies the pollution problem. This happens because cars tend to emit more pollutants when they are in slow-moving or stop-and-go traffic, as their engines work less efficiently under such conditions. To reduce the pollution caused by the transportation sector, several solutions are being explored and implemented across the world. These include promoting alternative, cleaner transportation modes, such as walking, biking, or public transport; encouraging the use of cleaner fuels and energy-efficient technologies in vehicles, like hybrid and electric cars; and implementing strict emission standards and regulations. In conclusion, adding more cars to the road contributes to an increase in pollution levels due to the combustion of fossil fuels. This in turn leads to the release of harmful pollutants and an adverse impact on the environment, public health, and the global climate. To mitigate this problem, we need to work on adopting cleaner and more sustainable transportation systems that minimize our reliance on fossil fuels and reduce the overall pollution levels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Article: Northern Europeans spend a lot of time in their cold and cloudy winters planning their summer holidays. They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing  powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially   produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red   and ultra-violet   rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Set in New York City, veteran thief Keith Ripley (Morgan Freeman) recruits younger crook Gabriel Martin (Antonio Banderas) to help him pull off one final job in order to repay his debt to the Russian mob, who had killed his previous partner, Victor Korolenko, over the debt before they could complete the plan. Martin is unsure of Ripley, but Ripley's goddaughter, Alexandra Korolenko (Radha Mitchell), who is also Victor's daughter, convinces him otherwise, although Ripley does not like that the two are getting close. Ripley tells Martin the plan, that they are going to steal from a Russian museum that has been smuggling Russian treasures into the country and bribing the NYPD with large donations and expensive equipment. The two infiltrate a party at the museum posing as cops, with Ripley as Lt. Weber (Robert Forster), a cop who has a particular vendetta against Ripley, to gather information about their vault. The Russian mob, led by Nicky Petrovitch (Rade Å erbedÅ¾ija), grow impatient with Ripley and kidnap Alexandra, telling them they must steal two FabergÃ© eggs from the Russian Museum in order to get her back, or she dies. When the duo get into the vaults of the museum with the eggs, Martin reveals he is an undercover cop from Miami planted by Weber to catch Ripley, leaves Ripley locked in the vault and informs Weber, while taking the eggs to the Russian mobster to free Alexandra. After Alexandra is released Martin is forced to meet with Nicky who reveals that the eggs they have stolen are made of wood (like the Karelian Birch egg). Meanwhile, Weber and his squad enter the museum, but are detained by the security guards due to Martin telling the guards he was a cop as he escaped. Martin reports in to the police the next morning after the police have picked up Nicky, only to learn that the man they have in custody is not the man Martin met, and that the man he met was actually Victor Korolenko, who had faked his death with Ripley's help. It is then revealed that Ripley had escaped, letting the museum know... Answer:","output":"\\"A Grand Deception: The Ripley Heist\\" Synopsis: In the bustling cityscape of New York, \\"A Grand Deception: The Ripley Heist\\" revolves around the intricate partnership between two thieves - the experienced mastermind Keith Ripley (Morgan Freeman) and the talented but hesitant newcomer Gabriel Martin (Antonio Banderas). Entangled in a dangerous game of deception and survival, Ripley is driven to settle an old score with the devastatingly cunning Russian mob, who has ruthlessly sought retribution by killing his previous partner, Victor Korolenko. As the plot unfurls, the lovely and persuasive Alexandra Korolenko (Radha Mitchell), Ripley's determined goddaughter and Victor's daughter, convinces Gabriel to collaborate with Ripley on an audacious final heist designed to repay the immense debt owed to the relentless Russian mafia. Despite the burgeoning attraction between Gabriel and Alexandra, the grand plan borders on the impossible: to steal priceless artifacts from a heavily-guarded Russian museum, which covertly funds its illicit operations by smuggling treasures into the country and bribing the NYPD. Disguised as New York's finest, Ripley and Gabriel infiltrate the museum's lavish gala to gather invaluable intel on the impenetrable vault. However, the plot thickens when the ruthless mob boss, Nicky Petrovich (Rade Šerbedžija), kidnaps Alexandra and raises the stakes - now, the duo must steal two extraordinarily rare Fabergé eggs to secure her freedom. Twists and turns abound as the thieves delve deeper into the museum's mysteries, ultimately culminating in Gabriel's shocking revelation: he is an undercover cop, planted by none other than vengeful Lt. Weber (Robert Forster) in an elaborate plan to capture Ripley. Betrayed, Ripley is abandoned in the vault as Gabriel races against time to rescue Alexandra. The final reveal astounds all - the stolen eggs are counterfeit, and the man claiming to be Nicky Petrovich was none other than the supposedly deceased Victor Korolenko. Masterminded by Ripley and Victor, this grand deception unfolds as a rousing triumph, leaving Gabriel questioning his loyalties, the NYPD in disarray, and the Russian mob forever haunted by the shadows of their adversaries. Blending captivating suspense with the unyielding pursuit of justice, \\"A Grand Deception: The Ripley Heist\\" is a cinematic experience that delves into the intricate worlds of crime, betrayal, and the irresistible allure of one last, glorious heist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.  Question: \\"What are a few public health initiatives that California passed?\\" Answer: \\"Require smog checks for clean air, pass anit-tobacco initiatives\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, this answer is correct. According to the given paragraph, California has been the first to pass major public health initiatives, including requiring smog checks for clean air and passing anti-tobacco initiatives. Additionally, California has also implemented bike helmet laws and was the first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars, and restaurants in 1998.

Premise: In addition to seeking clarification of various operational issues, some agencies raised questions concerning the statements of our audit and access authorities cited in the protocols. This premise states that agencies raised questions about operational issues and the statements of audit and access authorities mentioned in the protocols. It shows that there is some level of concern with both operational and authority-related matters. Hypothesis: The access authorities had left some of the agencies feeling uneasy when it was mentioned in the protocols. In this hypothesis, it is stated that some agencies are uneasy due to the access authorities mentioned in the protocols. This hypothesis is a more specific version of the concerns stated in the premise, which revolved around both operational issues and statements regarding audit and access authorities. Now, let's analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis: The premise suggests that some agencies have raised concerns about audit and access authorities cited in the protocols, while the hypothesis states that the access authorities specifically made some agencies feel uneasy. It can be inferred that the questions raised from the mentioned agencies indicate that they might have some discomfort or unease with the statements about audit and access authorities. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the premise, it can be reasonably assumed that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. That means the premise provides support for the hypothesis since the concerns of the agencies about the access authorities' statements can be linked to a certain level of uneasiness. However, it is important to recognize that the premise does not exclusively mention the access authorities causing unease, but rather includes broader concerns about operational issues and audit authorities as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Human Rights Council decried a wide range of human rights violations in Syria on Friday and called for U.N. bodies to consider a recent report detailing the abuses and take\\" appropriate action.\\" The council passed a resolution that \\"strongly condemns the continued widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities, such as arbitrary executions, excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, including against children.\\" There were 37 yes votes, four against and six abstentions at the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The group convened to consider action against Syria after a troubling report issued Monday by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry, a body appointed by the council. That report concluded security and military forces \\"committed crimes against humanity\\" against civilians. The resolution recommends that U.N. bodies \\"urgently consider\\" the commission report and \\"take appropriate action.\\" The group decided to send the Commission of Inquiry report to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \\"for appropriate action and transmission to all U.N. relevant bodies.\\" It backs \\"efforts to protect the population of the Syrian Arab Republic and to bring an immediate end to gross human rights violations.\\" And, it urged Syria \\"to protect its population\\" and \\"to immediately put an end to all human rights violations.\\" The resolution also decided \\"to establish a mandate of a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Syria and urges Syria to cooperate with it. Before the resolution was adopted, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay told the council Syria faces a \\"full-fledged civil war\\" if the regime's \\"continual ruthless repression\\" against peaceful demonstrators and civilians isn't stopped now. She noted with concern the reports of \\"increased armed attacks by the opposition forces, including the so-called Free Syrian army, against the Syrian military and security apparatus.\\" \\"In light of the manifest failure of the Syrian authorities to protect their citizens, the international community needs to take urgent and effective measures to protect the Syrian people,\\" Pillay said. \\"The United Nations secretary-general has urged the international community to act as one and take action in a collective and decisive manner to protect the Syrian people against the violations of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. All acts of murder, torture and other forms of violence must be stopped immediately. \\" The government crackdown began in mid-March as popular discontent against ruling powers spread across the Arab world. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad has blamed the violence on armed gangs. Pillay said \\"more than 4,000 people have reportedly been killed, thousands have been arrested, and more than 14,000 are reported to be in detention as a result of the crackdown.\\" She said many have had to flee their homes, at least 12,400 to neighboring countries and \\"tens of thousands\\" internally. Among those killed, she said, are 307 children. That prompted a reaction from the U.N. Children's Fund, which said it is \\"greatly disturbed by the confirmed reports of violent attacks on children in Syria.\\" \\"These include acts of killings, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, imprisonment, or other forms of severe deprivation of liberty and enforced disappearances throughout the country since March of this year,\\" she said. Even though it was denied access into Syria, the Commission of Inquiry interviewed \\"223 victims and witnesses, including military and security forces who had defected and testified to the role of Syrian forces in the use of lethal violence against peaceful protests. \\" The council resolution also called on Syrian authorities \\"to fully cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner, including through the establishment of a field presence\\" in Syria. Russia, China, Cuba and Ecuador voted against the resolution. Uganda, Philippines, India, Cameroon, Bangladesh, and Angola abstained. Among the countries voting for the resolution were Western nations like the United States and Italy and Syria's fellow Arab nations of Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Alastair Burt, the UK Foreign Office minister for the Middle East, called the council's vote \\"extremely significant.\\" He noted international efforts to put pressure on the Syrian government. The Arab League, Turkey, the European Union, and the United States are imposing sanctions on Syrian people and entities. \\"I welcome the strong action taken by the Council, and the hard-hitting resolution which it passed today by a very large majority. The resolution supports the Arab League's efforts to end the bloodshed in Syria and lays out exactly why the EU and U.N. General Assembly have taken such robust measures. It sends a very strong signal from countries across the world, including Arab partners, that they utterly condemn the horrific violations perpetrated by the Assad regime, and will continue to increase pressure on it. Today's resolution adds to the mounting pressure which the international community is bringing to bear on Syria.\\" Pillay told CNN that sanctions by neighboring states are \\"very important.\\" She also noted that Russia had called \\"on the Syrian government to address these serious violations and to stop them.\\" \\"That's an important voice. What I'm looking for is pressure building up on all sides,\\" she said. Syrian activists reported assaults by security personnel Friday. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said at least nine people were killed on Friday, including a child and a woman. There were three fatalities in Homs, two in both Latakia and Daraa, and one each in Hama and Idlib, the group said.

Furthermore, it was part of the prestigious 2017 ATP Challenger Tour, which showcases high-level competitions among rising stars and established players in the tennis world. The fact that it was the third edition of the tournament suggests that there were two previous editions held before January 2017. However, it is essential to note that the information provided does not explicitly indicate whether the hard courts were built explicitly for the third edition or were pre-existing and just utilized for the event. It is possible that the hard courts may have been used in the prior editions, but based on the given information, we can conclude that the hard courts were indeed the chosen surface for the 2017 City of Onkaparinga ATP Challenger. Considering that the tournament was held in Happy Valley, Australia, it is crucial to highlight the potential role of weather conditions during the competition. Australia's summer season occurs from December to February, so the tournament, taking place in January, likely experienced warm temperatures that can influence gameplay. These weather conditions, combined with the hard court surface, may have contributed to faster-paced, more aggressive play by the participants, an essential aspect to consider in tennis tournaments. In conclusion, we can infer that the 2017 City of Onkaparinga ATP Challenger was played on hard courts intended for the third edition of the tournament held in January 2017 in Happy Valley, Australia. It was a significant event, attracting both up-and-coming and experienced players in the tennis world, ultimately contributing to the overall development and progress of the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They expected her to arrive and take up her position at the hospital, and were further surprised at not receiving any communication from her. This suggests that they had anticipated news or an update on her situation based on her being listed as saved. However, the hypothesis suggests a slightly different scenario - that even though her name was not listed as alive (which seems to contradict the initial premise), the staff still heard from her soon after the tragedy.  Now, let's break down the hypothesis further to better understand if it follows the premise or not. 1. Her name was not listed as alive: This part of the hypothesis contradicts the premise, which stated that her name was in the list of the saved. 2.

Based on this analysis, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as there are discrepancies between the two statements. The premise indicates that the staff expected her to be alive due to her appearing in the list of saved individuals and were surprised by her not showing up or offering any communication.

In comparison, closets are often designed with a more general purpose in mind and can cater to a variety of storage requirements, but may not be as efficient in terms of shelf space. The main advantage of cabinets over closets is their customized design, allowing for a better organization of items. Cabinets usually comprise several compartments, drawers, and small or adjustable shelves, all of which contribute to maximizing the storage capacity within the given space. This highly organized structure ensures that items can be stored vertically as well as horizontally, making the most of every potential storage inch. In contrast, closets are often constructed with a more uniform internal layout and may only provide a single hanging rod and a few shelves. As a result, the space within a closet may not be as fully utilized, leading to wasted storage potential. Moreover, the height difference between shelves in a closet might not be optimal for certain items, leaving gaps of unused space while other items struggle to fit in. Another factor that contributes to the superiority of cabinet shelf space over closet space is the flexibility in customization. Cabinets can be easily tailored to suit specific needs, whether it's adjusting the height of shelves or adding extra drawers and compartments. This allows homeowners to create storage solutions that accommodate their unique belongings, ultimately improving organization and accessibility. On the other hand, modifying the configuration of a closet can be more challenging, especially if it is a built-in or walk-in closet with limited flexibility. Making significant changes to a closet's design might require hiring a professional to reconstruct it, whereas cabinets can often be easily upgraded or adjusted as needs change. Furthermore, cabinets typically offer greater visibility and easier access, as they are designed with doors that swing open to reveal the full breadth and depth of the storage space within. This makes it easier to locate and retrieve items, whereas closets usually have sliding or bifold doors that only reveal a part of the stored contents at one time. This can lead to items getting lost or overlooked, rendering the available shelf space less effective. In summary, the cabinets provide more shelf space than closets due to their specific designs targeted at optimal storage utilization, customization options, and improved organization and accessibility. While closets can offer a wide range of storage possibilities, their less specialized designs and layout constraints often result in less efficient use of the available interior space. Consequently, homeowners seeking versatile and efficient storage solutions may find cabinets to be a superior option over closets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No Neymar means no trophy and no trophy means no escaping the nightmare which has haunted Brazil for 64 years — ever since the last time they failed to win the World Cup on home soil. That appeared to be the consensus as celebrations that followed a 2-1 win against Colombia in a pulsating quarter-final were tinged with  sadness. Neymar’s injury had swiftly been confirmed as a broken vertebra, an X-ray was broadcast on television to prove the point and president Dilma Rousseff took to social media to offer her best wishes for a speedy recovery. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch videos of Neymar after his World Cup ending injury. Emotional: David Luiz hugs Neymar as he waits to board an ambulance after Friday's win over Colombia. Cynical: With the ball nowhere near Juan Zuniga smashes his knee into the lower part of Neymar's back. Agony: Neymar clutches his back after going down injured during Brazil's win over Colombia on Friday. Carried away: Neymar was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after Brazil's quarter-final win. ‘Forca Neymar,’ she tweeted, as did others such as model Gisele Bundchen, Miami Heat basketball star LeBron James and German footballers including Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski, who must have been secretly delighted to learn Brazil’s best player cannot face them in Tuesday’s semi-final. Hundreds of bright yellow replica No 10 shirts on market stalls and hawked by street sellers seemed to sag in disappointment, crested hairstyles drooped around Brazil and bookmakers, for the first time, decided the hosts could no longer be considered favourites to win. Neymar will not play again in this tournament. The initial diagnosis predicted an absence of about six weeks from football and, while parallels can be drawn with Pele — the original  No 10 who also hailed from the  Santos club and was fouled out of a World Cup, ending Brazilian hopes in 1966 — others tried to lift the gloom. Leading the campaign was David Luiz, climbing the popularity polls with a statesmanlike air. Get well soon: Thiago Silva hugs Neymar as the Brazil team wish their star man well after his injury. Precaution: Neymar is wheeled into hospital and appears to be on a drip as doctors attend to the injured star. Not only is he scoring precious goals, like the brilliant free-kick against Colombia, but the centre-half has a canny knack for connecting with the masses. ‘To play in a semi-final of the World Cup is a dream,’ said Luiz. ‘When I was young, I dreamed of days like this but I am sad because Neymar is out of the competition. 'He is like my brother. He is a great guy, a great person and a great player who brings the good things to football: happiness and magic. ‘Brazil will suffer a lot from this loss but Neymar will help us with his happiness. We have made a pact to support him. He will grow taller from this moment. It would be great if we could win it and celebrate with him.’ Moving: Neymar was flown to Sao Paulo by helicopter to begin his recovery. Devastated: Neymar is transported from an ambulance to a military helicopter to be airlifted home. Thanks: Neymar managed a wave as he left for Sao Paulo. Inside the squad, Neymar is so much more than an icon of youth culture. You can see that the warmth and affection colleagues reserve for him is genuine when you watch them training, where he laughs if one of his tricks fails and he is teased like anyone else. True, he is their most gifted creative force, capable of lifting Brazil out of the ordinary, but he also grafts and offers more humility than you might expect for a diamond-studded 22-year-old whose image appears at every turn and who is adored by millions. ‘Neymar is a boy who fights a lot,’ said Luiz. ‘He dreamed about playing in a World Cup and now he is out because of a foul the defender probably should have avoided.’ Colombia’s Juan Zuniga is Brazil’s new public enemy, the man who rammed his knee into the base of Neymar’s spine as they contested the ball near the end of the quarter-final. Support: Brazilian model Gisele Budnchen said she was praying for a fast recovery for her compatriot. Team spirit: Leo Messi also took to social media to wish his Barcelona teammate a speedy recovery. Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari claimed his star man had been ‘hunted’ by opponents after his terrific start to the tournament. Neymar suffered a knee injury against Chile when he was cut down in full flight. The Brazil manager, however, swerved the fact that his own side had employed strong-arm tactics on Friday in a bid to silence James Rodriguez, of Colombia. Luiz added: ‘I never crucify players. You do things when you are emotional and don’t think. 'I will just say if he did it with bad intentions because he wanted to  injure him, then I think he will feel sad. If he just tried to stop the game that’s natural, that’s football.’ Brazil captain Thiago Silva offered support for Zuniga. ‘I know him from Serie A and he does not have any nastiness in him,’ said PSG defender Silva, who was formerly at AC Milan. ‘What he did was rash but I know it can be difficult to get the ball from Neymar.’ The challenge is to prove there is life after Neymar for a team that have come to rely rather too heavily on his invention and goal threat. Without him, they will fret about how much they can create from open play. National icon: The Barcelona forward is by far the most popular player in Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad. Against Chile and Colombia, the goals came from centre-halves Luiz, who scored twice, and Silva, all from set-pieces. Who wins most of these free-kicks and corners? Neymar, by dribbling at defenders. In his absence, there will be a greater onus on others. Oscar is expected to return to a central role, which he will relish, and his Chelsea team-mate Willian is among the candidates to come in against Germany in Belo Horizonte. Almost as bad for Scolari is the loss of Silva. The captain is suspended after picking up a yellow card for interfering with a kick by Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. Broken: The x-ray showing Neymar's injured back, highlighting the broken bone. Silva was magnificent in the  quarter-final on Friday. He is the team’s strongest and most reliable defender, providing the stability which allows Luiz to step forward and contribute on the counter-attack. The loss will be eased by the return of defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo after a one-match ban but will still be keenly felt. ‘This is the moment to show the strength of the squad,’ said Silva. ‘This moment could mark the start of a revolution for us. 'We have proposed to win the World Cup for Neymar. This could unite us. It could give us more determination to win.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The article provides a detailed account of the events surrounding Neymar's injury during the 2014 FIFA World Cup quarter-final match between Brazil and Colombia. Neymar's injury, a broken vertebra, was a turning point for Brazil, as the star player was unable to play for the rest of the tournament, causing his teammates and the nation to rally behind him for a speedy recovery. Many high-profile supporters, including Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff and athletes like LeBron James, expressed their solidarity with Neymar on social media. The article also discusses the impact of Neymar's absence on Brazil's gameplay, as the team struggled in subsequent matches without their iconic player's creativity and goal-scoring prowess. The article highlights the sportsmanship of Brazil captain Thiago Silva, who supported his teammate Neymar but also defended the Colombian player who caused the injury, Juan Zuniga. The piece concludes by discussing the team's determination to win the World Cup for Neymar and to prove their resilience in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The National Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report Thursday on the New Jersey Turnpike crash that badly injured Morgan and killed one of his friends, comedian James McNair, in the early morning hours of June 7.      Morgan, 45, suffered broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken leg. His condition has been upgraded from critical to fair, his publicist Lewis Kay said this week. The condition of another limo passenger, Jeff Millea, has also improved to fair, Kay said.      Hospitalized Tracy Morgan upgraded to fair condition      A criminal complaint filed by police said driver Kevin Roper had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash. Roper, 35, pleaded not guilty to charges that include vehicular homicide and assault by auto. He is free on 50,000 bond.      The NTSB report said the 2011 Peterbilt truck owned and operated by Walmart was speeding at 65 mph for the 60 seconds before the crash. Roper allegedly ignored a sign a mile earlier warning that lanes were closed ahead for construction and another sign a half-mile later reducing the speed limit from 55 mph to 45 mph, the report said.      The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter limo carrying Morgan and five other passengers had slowed down because of congestion caused by the center and right lanes being shut down to allow contractors to work on a large overhead sign nearly 3 miles down the road, the NTSB said.      The truck struck the rear of Morgan's limo, and the \\"two vehicles moved forward and were involved in secondary impacts with other vehicles that were slowed in the traffic queue,\\" the report said. \\"The limo van rolled over and came to rest on its left side, facing east, across the center and right lanes.\\"      Roper, who lives in Georgia but was based in Delaware, reported for work at 11:22 a.m. on June 6, according to the NTSB report. He made deliveries to Walmart stores in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania before the wreck 13 hours, 32 minutes later, it said. Federal rules limit interstate commercial drivers to 14-hour shifts before they must rest, the report said.      His total driving time that day was 9 hours, 37 minutes, which is below the 11 hours allowed by federal limits, the report said.      The NTSB, however, is also looking at how long Roper was awake and driving before he reported to work the day before the crash, officials told CNN on Thursday. He lives in Georgia and commutes to his job more than 700 miles away in Smyrna, Delaware, NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said.      Federal investigators based their preliminary findings largely on the small computer on board the truck that records speed, engine performance, brakes and other information, the report said.      Walmart said last week that it believed Roper was operating within federal rest guidelines but said it would take full responsibility if the investigation shows its truck was to blame. \\"The details are the subject of the ongoing investigation, and we are cooperating fully with the appropriate law enforcement agencies,\\" said Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the company.      The NTSB also released new images of the truck and van based on 3-dimensional scans of them after the crash.      Morgan was a regular on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" for seven years and later received an Emmy nomination for his role in the comedy series \\"30 Rock.\\"      Funny man Tracy Morgan has known fame and foibles      CNN's Mike Ahlers and Rene Marsh contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"Actor and comedian Tracy Morgan returned to performing in October after recovering from injuries sustained in a six-vehicle accident in June 2014.

Please answer the following question: Title: Piss Poor recording Product review: Don't buy it, unless you're dying to hear Feiruz like I was. Her voice gets so monotonous after a while. I gave the CD away! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. There are several reasons to support this claim.  Firstly, the choice of words used in the title, \\"Piss Poor recording,\\" suggests a strong negative sentiment from the reviewer. The term \\"piss poor\\" is a colloquial expression often utilized to describe an inferior or substandard quality. In this context, it gives prospective buyers an immediate impression that the product does not meet the reviewer's expectations for quality and performance. Secondly, the review discourages potential customers from purchasing the product as the reviewer explicitly states, \\"Don't buy it.\\" By urging others not to buy the product, the reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction and attempting to prevent others from experiencing the same disappointment. With this statement, the reviewer portrays the product as unworthy of investment for other consumers. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that they were \\"dying to hear Feiruz,\\" expressing a level of enthusiasm or excitement towards the artist. However, this excitement quickly dissipates as they explain that her voice becomes monotonous after a while. The use of the word \\"monotonous\\" suggests that the reviewer found the singer's voice boring, repetitive, and devoid of variation in tone or pitch. This critique of the artist's performance communicates to prospective buyers that the product may not offer the listening pleasure they seek. Furthermore, the reviewer's action of giving away the CD further emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the product. Giving away something they have purchased signifies that the product was unable to offer enough value or enjoyment to keep it in their possession. This sends a strong message to potential buyers that the product may not be worth purchasing or keeping in one's collection. In summary, the review paints the product in an unflattering light by using strong negative language, discouraging others from purchasing, critiquing the artist's performance, and revealing that the product was ultimately given away due to dissatisfaction. Consequently, potential buyers reading this review would most likely be deterred from purchasing the product, as it does not seem to provide a positive or gratifying experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the sentence \\"The stories as to the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island.\\" answer the question \\"What does the flounder of the Tuvalu myth represent?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"The stories as to the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island\\" does not answer the question \\"What does the flounder of the Tuvalu myth represent?\\" The statement seems to discuss the differing narratives about the ancestry of the Tuvaluans across the various islands of Tuvalu. It is an expression of the diverse cultural perspectives and oral traditions that may exist within a community. On the other hand, the question \\"What does the flounder in the Tuvalu myth represent?\\" is asking for an interpretation of a specific mythological symbol, in this case, the flounder. To answer this question correctly, one would need knowledge of the particular myth where the flounder appears, and the symbolic or metaphoric role the flounder plays within that myth. Many myths and legends convey complex meanings and guidance for living through their narratives and the characters or emblems that feature in them. A symbol like a flounder could therefore be interpreted in various ways based on its behavior, attributes, and the context of the story it appears in. For instance, it could represent aspects such as cunning, perseverance, abundance, or transformation, among potentially many other interpretations. Without specific details from the relevant Tuvalu myth, it is hard to state definitively what the flounder represents; irrespective, the original statement does not provide this information. Given the differences in the focus and content of the statement and the question, it is clear that the sentence concerning the varying stories of Tuvaluan's ancestors does not provide an answer to the question regarding the representation of the flounder in a Tuvalu myth. Thus, to answer the question about the Tuvalu flounder symbol, it would be crucial to investigate the specific myths and legends of Tuvalu where this symbol appears."},{"instruction":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

You don't want to suddenly jump into an exercise routine you're not used to, especially if you weren't exercising much before your pregnancy. Start with just fifteen minutes of exercise three times a week. Over time, you can gradually increase the amount. Swimming is a good way to begin exercising, partially because your increased weight won't be an issue in the water. Ask the instructors at your local pool if they offer any prenatal swimming classes. Talking a walk every day can help keep things moving. Plus, it can help you keep from gaining too much baby weight. Of course, you're probably not going to try to play football while pregnant.

Just cut the four sides off the wood at a 30 degree angle. with a saw.","output":"Between the two solutions provided, the second option (II) is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning for making a hexagon shape out of a piece of wood. However, neither option is entirely accurate. Here's a detailed description of how to properly make a hexagon shape: 1. Prepare the wood: Begin by selecting a good-quality piece of flat, smooth wood, which is suitable for your desired hexagonal project. The selected wood should be free of cracks, knots, and other imperfections. 2. Determine the desired side lengths and angles: Measure and decide on the desired side length of your hexagonal shape. Since a hexagon has six sides of equal length and equally spaced internal angles of 120 degrees, you can easily calculate the angles needed for cutting (120° / 2 = 60°). 3. Calculate the dimensions: You can use basic geometry formulas to calculate the length of your wood and other dimensions. For example, to find the distance between two opposite sides, you can use the formula (side length x square root of 3) / 2. 4. Mark the cuts: Use a measuring tape, a carpenter's square, and a pencil to mark the locations of the six angled cuts, thus forming a hexagonal shape on your piece of wood. Given the measurements of your hexagonal shape, you might want to use a protractor to help ensure precise angles of 60 degrees for each cut. 5. Make the first cut: With a miter saw or a table saw with a miter gauge, set the saw to a 60-degree angle. Align the wood and carefully make the first cut along the marked line. Use a saw with a fine, sharp blade to ensure smooth cuts and to avoid tearing or splintering the wood. 6. Rotate and continue cutting: After making the first cut, rotate the wood and align the next marked line with the saw blade. Ensure that the angle is still set at 60 degrees before making the next cut. Continue this process for each of the six angles. 7. Sand the edges: Once all six cuts are made and you have your hexagonal shape, you'll want to smooth any rough or jagged edges with sandpaper. Be sure to maintain the precise angles and side lengths of your hexagon while sanding. 8. Finishing touches: Once the edges are smooth and the shape is well-defined, you can proceed with any staining, painting, or finishing treatments that suit your project. So, in conclusion, option II is closer to the correct process but still requires adjustments and more accurate angle measurements for cutting a hexagon shape out of a piece of wood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The","output":"beetle, with its iridescent wings and unusual markings, had piqued his interest as it wasn't a species he recognized from his years of research. He carefully placed the insect on the viewing platform and adjusted the magnification on the microscope. Step 1: Prepare the insect for observation He makes sure the beetle is safely and comfortably secured on the platform, ensuring that no harm comes to it during the process. He does this because he values the well-being of living creatures and wants to avoid causing any undue stress. Step 2: Adjust the microscope settings The scientist adjusts the magnification on the microscope to get a better view of the beetle's exoskeleton, wings, and other features. He does this to study the beetle's anatomy and look for any unique characteristics that might help in identifying the species. Step 3: Carefully study the features of the beetle He begins analyzing the structure of the beetle, paying close attention to the coloration and patterns on the wings and exoskeleton. He notes the specific details in a journal for future reference. He meticulously observes these features to learn more about the insect and possibly determine its evolutionary history or place within the ecosystem. Step 4: Consult reference materials The scientist consults with the existing literature and searches through his extensive collection of entomology books to compare the beetle to known species. He wants to ensure that this beetle is genuinely unfamiliar and not just a variation of an existing species. Step 5: Collaborate with colleagues As the beetle remains unidentified, the scientist decides to consult with fellow researchers in the field, sharing the details and images of the beetle. He values the knowledge of his peers and seeks their input, as they may be able to provide insights or recognize the species from their own work. Step 6: Pursue DNA analysis Realizing that traditional methods may not be sufficient to identify the beetle, the scientist considers using modern DNA analysis techniques. This would involve carefully extracting a sample of the beetle's DNA and comparing it to a database of known species. It would increasingly help in narrowing down the possibilities and potentially provide a conclusive identification. Step 7: Document the findings and publish the research Upon identifying the beetle or finding that it represents an entirely new species, the scientist compiles his findings and drafts a research paper outlining the details of the insect. He aims to share his discoveries with the scientific community and contribute to the broader understanding of the world's biodiversity. Throughout this process, the scientist remains driven by his passion for understanding the natural world and unlocking the mysteries hidden within the seemingly small and mundane. His curiosity leads him to dedicate his time and expertise to the study of this enigmatic beetle, ultimately enriching the collective knowledge of entomology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the second act of Tosca, according to Newman, Puccini rises to his greatest height as a master of the musical macabre. The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him. In the dialogue with Spoletta, the \\"torture\\" motif—an \\"ideogram of suffering\\", according to Budden—is heard for the first time as a foretaste of what is to come. As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca's voice is heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, \\"[its] suave strains contrast[ing] dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening colour of the stage action\\". The cantata is most likely the Cantata a Giove, in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini's from 1897.Osborne describes the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief \\"Vittoria! Vittoria!\\" on the news of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria \\"Già, mi dicon venal\\" (\\"Yes, they say I am venal\\") is closely followed by Tosca's \\"Vissi d'arte\\". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, this is perhaps the opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it \\"a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously\\". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous \\"E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!\\" (\\"All Rome trembled before him\\"), sung on a middle C♯ monotone  (sometimes spoken), the music gradually...

The word \\"experience\\" in the two sentences carries different meanings. Let's analyze both sentences to understand the different contexts in which the word is used. In the first sentence, \\"It was an experience he would not soon forget,\\" the word \\"experience\\" refers to a singular happening or event that the subject, in this case, \\"he,\\" encountered or participated in. The emphasis is on the distinct interaction or occurrence that left a long-lasting impression on the individual.

In the second sentence, \\"He had a religious experience,\\" the word \\"experience\\" is used to describe a deeply spiritual or transcendental event that the subject underwent. The context here is more about the emotional or psychological aspects of the interaction, which may include feelings of awe, enlightenment, or deep connection with a higher power or spiritual reality. This usage of \\"experience\\" is often associated with a life-changing moment or transformative realization, particularly in relation to one's faith, beliefs, or understanding of existence.

Answer:","output":"The Ottoman Empire, which spanned from the 14th to the early 20th century, was a vast and powerful empire that controlled large regions of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa. At its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries, the empire consisted of territories that included modern-day Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Hungary, the Balkans, parts of the Middle East, and North Africa. It was a multicultural and multi-religious empire, with a diverse blend of ethnic groups and faiths. The capital of the Ottoman Empire was Constantinople (now Istanbul), a city that served as a bridge between Europe and Asia. The majority of the population followed Islam, and the empire was ruled by a Sultan who was regarded as both the political leader and the protector of the Islamic faith. The architecture of the Ottoman Empire was exemplified by grand mosques, palaces, and public buildings, displaying a unique blend of Byzantine and Islamic styles. Notable examples include the Blue Mosque and the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. The empire was also known for its art, literature, and music, with contributions such as the Iznik tiles, Ottoman miniature paintings, and classical poetry. In its administrative structure, the Ottoman Empire employed a hierarchical system, with the Sultan at the top, followed by the ruling elite, known as the Devshirme, which consisted of Christian-born converts who held high administrative and military positions. A highly effective military force, the Janissaries, was also developed and played a crucial role in the empire's expansion and defense. The Ottoman Empire began to decline in the 18th and 19th centuries due to internal strife, weakening political structures, and increasing pressure from European powers. It eventually dissolved after World War I, leading to the formation of modern-day Turkey and several other nations in the former empire's territories."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Channel 4's Jay Hunt said Leith and Hollywood had \\"huge amounts of expertise\\", while Toksvig and Fielding would bring \\"plenty of fun and warmth\\". \\"It's just the sort of innovative line-up audiences expect from Channel 4,\\" the channel's chief creative officer continued. The BBC lost the contract to broadcast Bake Off last year after Love Productions, the makers of the show, signed a three-year deal with Channel 4. Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, the programme's previous co-hosts, declined to follow it to its new home, while Berry said she was \\"never asked\\". The show made its debut on BBC Two in 2010, moving to BBC One in 2014. Earlier on Thursday, BBC director general Tony Hall admitted he was \\"very upset to lose the Bake Off\\". \\"We'll just have to pick ourselves up, and we are doing, and coming up with new things too,\\" he told young reporters taking part in this year's BBC News School Report.

William Randolph Hearst Sr. (; April 29, 1863 - August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father. As biographer Ben Proctor explains:  During the 1920s he became an avowed Jeffersonian Democrat, warning his fellow citizens against the dangers of big government, of unchecked federal power that could infringe on the individual rights of Americans, especially if a charismatic leader was in charge....[After supporting FDR in 1932] Hearst soon became highly critical of the New Deal. With increasing frequency Hearst newspapers supported big business to the detriment of organized labor. With unabated vigor they condemned higher income tax legislation as a persecution of the \\"successful.\\"  Hearst broke with FDR in spring 1935 when the president vetoed the Patman Bonus Bill for veterans and tried to enter the World Court. Hearst's papers were his weapon. They carried the publisher's rambling, vitriolic, all-capital-letters editorials, but he no longer employed the energetic reporters, editors, and columnists who might have made a serious attack. He reached 20 million readers in the mid 1930s, but they included much of the working class that Roosevelt had swept by three-to-one margins in the 1936 election. The Hearst papers--like most major chains--had supported the Republican Alf Landon that year.  In 1934, after checking with Jewish leaders to ensure a visit would be to their benefit, Hearst visited Berlin to interview Adolf Hitler. When Hitler asked why he was so misunderstood by the American press, Hearst retorted: \\"Because Americans believe in democracy, and are averse to dictatorship.\\" Hearst's papers ran columns without rebuttal by Nazi leader Hermann Goring and Hitler himself, as well as Mussolini and other dictators in Europe and Latin America. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they persuade him or was it on his own","output":"According to the article, it seems that Hearst made his decision on his own, as evidenced by the quote: \\"In 1934, after checking with Jewish leaders to ensure a visit would be to their benefit, Hearst visited Berlin to interview Adolf Hitler.\\" This quote suggests that Hearst took initiative and consulted Jewish leaders before deciding to interview Hitler, implying that the decision was his own and not solely based on others' persuasion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the six months since BBC News first visited Oberhausen, the mood here has changed. The majority of people still welcome new arrivals, but there are some who say they are creating a strain on a local economy with an 11% rate of unemployment. Oberhausen lies in the western region of North Rhine-Westphalia, which took in an estimated 21% of asylum seekers in 2015, more than anywhere else in the country. Nearly 3,000 refugees, many fleeing conflict in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, settled in Oberhausen last year. A BBC team first visited in October 2015 and has returned to speak to aid workers, residents and the asylum seekers themselves. How was Oberhausen coping when the BBC visited in 2015? Last October, Joerg Fischer was struggling with the constant flow of new arrivals in his refugee transit camp in Central Oberhausen. But since the start of the year, the closure of border crossings in the Balkans has significantly reduced the movement of migrants into Europe. \\"We are on top of the situation. This is why we can close down this camp for example… but still we do not think it is the end of this situation… that is why this camp will be on standby and will not be terminally closed.\\" Many of the migrants and refugees who arrived at the Red Cross transit camps have now been rehoused in private accommodation. By late April, 1,721 migrants were living in homes provided for by the city council. A further 1,092 were living in the camps. Twenty two-year-old Khaled Kohestani, from Afghanistan, is one of the lucky ones. He's just moved into a one-bedroom flat with his wife and baby after three months of living in a camp. Khaled has begun learning German and is looking for work. He says he's been treated very well by the people of Oberhausen, but has struggled at times to understand German customs: \\"When we get on the bus in our country everyone is friendly and they say hello to each other,\\" says Khaled with a smile on his face. \\"But here people are just sitting and they just want to keep their privacy. We tried to be quiet and not say anything because we are scared, we don't know the rules, maybe it's illegal to talk? But nowadays I understand it and it has become a little better for me.\\" Social etiquette has also become an issue at AQUApark, Oberhausen's biggest swimming pool. General Manager Timor Schrimer says the pool's rules have been printed in Arabic on leaflets to help the new arrivals understand German customs. It follows an incident where a German woman was groped in the pool by a migrant. The police were called to the swimming pool and arrested a man. He's since released without being prosecuted. Oberhausen police say there have been seven recorded cases of disturbances relating to the new arrivals since July 2015. Most were due to anti-social behaviour in residential areas surrounding the refugee camps. Tom Litges, Oberhausen's Chief Police Inspector says the cases don't represent a significant rise in crime. But after hundreds of sex attacks were carried out on women on New Year's Eve in nearby Cologne, some Oberhausen residents began calling for civil patrols. The police organised a live Facebook Q&A session to reassure residents. \\"We could explain that the situation in Oberhausen was completely different than that night in Cologne and that calmed the situation down,\\" says Mr Litges. 211,888 population of Oberhausen 2,813 are refugees 12,815 people in the town  are unemployed (11.7% unemployment rate) 1,312 of them are under 25 (11.5% youth unemployment rate) 228 of the 305 refugee job centre candidates are from Syria Svenja Beyer has been teaching at an integration school, set up especially to explain the German language and way of life. Since the BBC's last visit to Oberhausen, her class has grown from 10 to 34 pupils from nine different countries. It's made controlling the classroom a lot harder. \\"We have problems with aggressive behaviour and fights between different ethnic groups,\\" says Ms Beyer. \\"We have situations that Muslim boys don't want to sit on one table with Christian girls.  Integration is difficult for some pupils. But there are really good children where integration is [going] well. They come here and after three weeks they speak German fluently.\\" For elderly residents of the Haus Abendfrieden retirement home in Oberhausen, the key to successful integration lies in good communication between the newcomers and German citizens. \\"I think that many Germans don't want to deal with the whole thing, let alone to help those that need it, be it in general or in the street. They just close their mind,\\" says 75-year-old Vera Hufer. \\"It is important to reach out to foreigners and ask them 'may I help you?' … If we all put a little effort into it, then it will work.\\" This article was about:","output":"The article discusses the situation in Oberhausen, a city in the western region of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, which took in an estimated 21% of asylum seekers in 2015.

We open with Colonel Luc Deveraux (Van Damme), the original Universal Soldier and his buxom Asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be Universal Soldiers. They almost kill the two, then oh wait, it was just a field test. Deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of Universal Soldiers. Why he would want to be involved in this (if you know anything about the original) is never explained and well beyond me. It's after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going. The United States government has cut the Universal Soldier's project budget and in the process angered SETH (the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the Universal Soldiers). Naturally he won't be shut down without a fight. So that means Van Damme has to go around and take all the new breed of Universal Soldiers out. Which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel, but that doesn't stop it from becoming stupid as hell.  For instance, one of the new Universal Soldiers is played by Bill Goldberg. Seems you can't go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie. He's big, he's tough, right? Wrong. Van Damme doesn't seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him... once ... twice ... three times. The point here lost on me. Then there's the breaking of glass. A rudimentary part of any action movie, but someone involved must have a glass fetish. You have to see the fight scenes in particular. Let's not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips.

I can use this background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.  Now, I have a new situation: Bob is a financial analyst. He used to work for company A. Bob noticed that company A is mostly financed by debt. Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity.  Answer this question please: Would company B have or not have tax benefits of debt?","output":"To answer the question, let's consider the given information and the trade-off theory of capital structure step-by-step. 1. Company A is primarily financed by debt, which suggests that it benefits from tax deductions specific to debt. 2. Company B, on the other hand, is predominantly financed by equity. 3. The trade-off theory of capital structure states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, which are the tax benefits of debt. Given the information above, Company B, which is mostly financed by equity, would not have significant tax benefits of debt. This is because its financing structure does not rely heavily on debt, and therefore, it would not be utilizing the advantages of debt financing to the same extent as Company A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her...

Choices: A). no. B). yes. The answer is:","output":"B). yes. The two questions are essentially asking the same thing, which is how to track the location of a person using their mobile phone number. While the phrasing of the questions is slightly different, the overall subject matter and goal are the same.  Mobile phone tracking is a technology that involves the collection of data to identify the location of a mobile phone or its user. There are several methods to achieve this, which include: 1. Global Positioning System (GPS): Smartphones usually have built-in GPS technology that transmits the device's location through satellites. GPS-based location tracking provides accurate information in real time. 2. Cell Tower Triangulation: This method involves gathering information from multiple cellular towers to estimate the location of the mobile device. This method becomes less accurate as the distance from the towers increase. 3. Wi-Fi-based positioning: If the mobile device is connected to a Wi-Fi network, its location can be approximated based on the known location of the Wi-Fi access point. This method is useful in urban areas where Wi-Fi networks are more prevalent but may not be precise. 4. Location-Based Services (LBS): LBS uses data collected by mobile network providers to determine the location of the mobile device. This method relies on the interaction between the mobile device and the cellular network, making it less accurate than GPS. 5. IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) tracking: The unique identifier of a mobile device, known as the IMEI number, can be used by law enforcement or service providers to track the location of a device under certain circumstances, such as in the case of theft. 6. Mobile applications: Many tracking applications are available for smartphones that use a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and/or cellular data to track the location of the device. Examples include Find My iPhone and Android Device Manager. It is important to note that tracking a mobile number and its location, without the owner's consent, is a violation of privacy and may result in legal consequences.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation. The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\". Problem:My husband (31M) and I (29F) have been married 4yrs, together 11yrs and have a 3 y.o. child. Bit of background with both of us, he's an only child with a pretty stable upbringing (loving parents, no traumas etc) whereas I grew up with screaming parents that hated each other, being beaten all the time by my mother because it reminded her of my dad and pretty much no inkling of stability. I have promised myself then when I do become a mother I will never raise my child like how I was raised. Fast forward to having the 3rd member of our family...my pregnancy was smooth, no complications and I didnt really hate being pregnant. What traumatized me was post birth, recovery and basically the next 2.5yrs of the child's upbringing. Probably TMI but I had significant tearing, hemorrhoids, couldnt breastfeed, sleep deprived for 2yrs, my husband could not tolerate the sleep deptivation so he took it out on me and basically no support from either family which made me feel really lonely. This along with my childhood I guess had led me to being diagnosed with clinical severe depression and anxiety which I have been battling by the scrape of my teeth (some days I just dont want to live on this Earth). All of that has led me deciding to not having any more children as I dont want to deal with all that trauma again, whereas my husband wants otherwise. Essentially I will be the main caregiver (unless he grows a vagina and a pair of boobs to keep it alive). I told him what I've mentioned here but he's adamant it'll be different the next round because that's what everyone's been telling him and it'll be good for our 3 y.o. to have a sibling. AITA here or should I compromise???? Solution:","output":"Part #1: Understand the ethical situation within the anecdote.  Usage: The ethical situation here revolves around the decision of the woman not to have any more children due to the trauma and complications she experienced during and after the birth of her first child. The challenge comes from her husband's insistence on having another child despite her reservations and personal issues. From the woman's perspective, she has been primarily responsible for the care of the child, and she feels that the same will happen if they have another child. This situation has led to her questioning whether she's being unethical by not compromising.  Part #2: Evaluate the actions of the author of the anecdote. Usage: The author of this anecdote is the woman herself who is sharing her personal issues and experiences. She has faced depression, anxiety, and felt unsupported after the birth of her first child. She made a decision not to have more children based on her personal experiences and impacts on her mental health. This can be regarded as a form of self-love and self-protection where she's trying to safeguard her mental health against possible harm.  Part #3: Provide a judgement on whether the author's action was ethical.  Usage: In this example, the woman's decision can be justified on ethical ground. \\"RIGHT\\" would be the response because she is considering her mental health and its potential impacts on the well-being of her current and future child. It is ethical as the decision is being made to prevent potential harm or detriment to herself and her children. The husband insisting to have another child without considering the impact it might place on her is less ethically sound than her refusal to bear another child.  In all three parts, the essential activity is to understand the given situation, evaluate the involved actions, and make a judgement on their ethical standings based on the information provided in the anecdote."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is charged with murder over a double stabbing in inner Sydney. Her co-accused and boyfriend Michael Lee, 36, was a long-time drug user who lived in a halfway house in Sydney's west. Harriet's father Neville Wran was premier of NSW from 1973 to 1986. He died in April and she read at his state memorial service. Article:","output":"Title: Harriet Wran: Grieving Daughter to Murder Suspect The tragic tale of Harriet Wran, the 26-year-old daughter of the late Neville Wran, former premier of New South Wales (NSW), has taken a dramatic and unexpected turn. As she now faces charges for her alleged involvement in a violent double stabbing that occurred in inner Sydney, many are left to wonder how the promising young woman could have been drawn into a disturbing world of crime and addiction. Wran has been charged for her supposed connection to a horrifying attack that took place in a small apartment in Redfern, Sydney. It was here that two men were stabbed, resulting in one fatality – the death of the victim. Harriet's co-accused, her boyfriend Michael Lee, is a long-time drug user, who, until recently, had been living in a halfway house in Sydney's west. The 36-year-old, who now faces murder charges along with Wran, has a troubling criminal history that reportedly led the couple further into the darkness. The gravity of this situation is all the more poignant considering the legacy of Harriet's father, Neville Wran. Having held the position of premier for NSW from 1973 to 1986, he was a well-respected and influential figure for the region. His death in April resonated deeply with many Australians, and it is difficult to reconcile this impressive figure with Harriet's current circumstances. At the time of his death, the bond between father and daughter was evident, as she delivered a heartfelt reading during his state memorial service. Yet the dark path Harriet found herself on following this loss tells a story of grief and desperation, as she potentially sought solace in dangerous and illicit activities. As news of these charges come to light, many are questioning what led Harriet down such a perilous path. Having been born into a life of privilege and political influence, it seems incomprehensible that the daughter of such a highly regarded figure would wind up involved in such a grisly incident. Nevertheless, Harriet Wran's descent into this world appears to have been fueled by a combination of personal tragedy and destructive influences. It is disheartening to think that a woman with such potential may have had her life derailed so violently. People close to Harriet have described her as a promising young woman, and it becomes even more unsettling to think about her melancholy trajectory. The case of Harriet Wran serves as a sobering reminder that wealth and privilege may not necessarily shield an individual from the darker aspects of life. As we watch her journey unfold through the justice system, one wonders if anything could have been done to prevent this terrible turn of events. In any case, it is essential to remain mindful of the power of compassion in times of grief and loss, and to provide support to those closest to us. Perhaps in doing so, there may be hope of preventing similar tragic circumstances from unfolding in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Fed proposes lower store fees on debit purchases The Federal Reserve proposed on Thursday lowering the fees that merchants must pay when shoppers use debit cards, a move that could reduce retail prices but result in higher banking fees for consumers. Under the recommended new rules, the so-called interchange fee, or \\"swipe fee,\\" on debit cards would be capped at 12 cents - about 70 percent lower than the average fee of 44 cents per transaction last year, according to the Fed. The total amount banks received from debit card interchange fees was 16.2 billion. The move was applauded by retail industry groups and small businesses, which have long complained that the fees were excessive and they have little power to negotiate them down. Retailers have also said the cost of the fees is second only to labor and is growing faster than health care expenses. On Thursday, they said the new rules would allow them to deliver significant savings to shoppers. \\"This is not only good for businesses, but most importantly it's good for consumers,\\" said Hank Armour, chief executive of National Association of Convenience Stores. \\"There is an abundant amount of evidence cost savings will be passed through.\\" Interchange rates are set by card processors such as Visa and MasterCard and paid to banks as an incentive to use their networks. In a statement, the American Bankers Association, a trade group, said the proposal would have a \\"dramatic impact\\" on the industry at a time when bank revenue has also been curtailed by strict new regulations on credit card interest rates and overdraft fees. The swipe fee ruling would reduce banks' ability to offer basic low-cost services, make loans and fight fraud, he said. \\"The proposal seems little more than direct government interference in the card payments system on behalf of large retailers and at the expense of everyday consumers,\\" ABA Chief Executive Edward L. Yingling said. Banks have begun seeking ways to recoup their losses from the wave of new regulations passed by Congress. Tower Group analyst Brian Riley said they would probably consider instituting charges for accounts that carry low balances or are used infrequently. He noted there is no mandate from the Fed or Congress that retailers lower prices to reflect the reduced interchange rate - and the worst case-scenario for consumers is if banks raise their fees and merchants don't cut prices. \\"There's no tie-in from the beginning . . . to ensure that consumers see this as a price benefit,\\" Riley said. \\"It just gets lost in the revenue model of the retailers.\\" Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), who sponsored the legislation that required the Fed to address the issue, said he will be monitoring any new bank fees closely. \\"I worry that the banks and credit card companies, faced with change and reform, will do the same thing they've always done: Create a new product, create a new fee, find a new loophole,\\" he said. The Fed is gathering comments for several options for determining interchange fees. The first allows issuers to set the rate at a \\"safe harbor\\" of 7 cents or less. Issuers could also choose to determine their own average cost of authorizing, clearing and settling debit transactions, with a cap of 12 cents. The final option allows any interchange rate of 12 cents or less. One key issue the Fed did not address in detail was fraud. Card processors and banks have argued that the cost of preventing and investigating fraud should be included in the interchange fees. The Fed said that it is still considering the issue and would develop a separate proposal to address it. It is also considering ways to increase competition among the methods for processing card transactions. The law applies only to debit cards - not credit cards - and exempts government benefit cards and prepaid cards from the new regulations. It also would not apply to banks with assets less than 10 billion, but community banks still oppose the rule, saying they will probably have to comply with lower interchange rates or risk not being accepted by merchants. \\"It is naÃÂ¯ve to think that a reduction in debit interchange of the scale proposed today to large issuers will not be felt with equal pain by those purportedly 'carved out' from the provision,\\" Karen Thomas, senior executive vice president of government relations for the Independent Community Bankers of America, said in a statement. The Fed is accepting comments on the proposed rules through Feb. 22. A final ruling is expected by April. Summary:","output":"The Federal Reserve has proposed to lower the interchange fees on debit card transactions, which merchants must pay when customers use their debit cards for purchases. The suggested cap on the swipe fee is 12 cents, a reduction from the previous average of 44 cents per transaction. This move could decrease retail prices but may result in increased banking fees for consumers. Retail industry groups and small businesses welcome this decision, as they have been battling high swipe fees for a long time. However, the American Bankers Association warns that this change could impact the industry negatively and may lead to direct government interference in the card payment system. The Federal Reserve is considering several options for determining interchange fees and is now focusing on the issue of fraud prevention costs.

Personal Information: Josef Mattauch was born on November 21, 1895, and passed away on August 10, 1976. He was a German physicist by profession.  2. Scientific Specialization: Mattauch specialized in mass spectrometry, which is a powerful analytical technique used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions allowing the identification of chemical substances through their mass spectra. This area of study focuses on the investigation of isotopic abundances, which are the natural variations in the quantities of different isotopes of an element in a given sample. These isotopic abundances provide critical information about the sample's age, origin, and history. 3. Major Contribution: Josef Mattauch's most well-known and significant contribution to the field of mass spectrometry came in the form of the Mattauch Isobar Rule, which he established in 1934. The Mattauch Isobar Rule states that in the mass spectrum of an element, the intensity of an isotope peak is directly proportional to the number of isotopes with the same mass number. This rule is particularly useful in distinguishing between peak positions of different isotopes in a mass spectrum, helping researchers analyze complex mixtures of isotopes and understand their properties better. 4. Legacy: Josef Mattauch's work on isotopic abundances and the establishment of the Mattauch Isobar Rule have had a significant impact on modern science, particularly in the fields of nuclear physics, chemistry, and environmental sciences. His pioneering work led to the development of improved techniques and methodologies for mass spectrometry, facilitating the analysis of samples and expanding the body of knowledge on isotopic properties and behaviors. 5. Context: Considering that Josef Mattauch was active as a physicist during the early and mid-20th century, his work likely came as a response to the increasing interest in understanding atomic and nuclear structures during this period. His work and innovations would also have driven progress in fields such as nuclear power generation, weapons development, and exploration of isotopic applications in biological and environmental contexts. To summarize, these are the key details about Josef Mattauch from the given bio: - Name: Josef Mattauch - Birthdate: November 21, 1895 - Death date: August 10, 1976 - Nationality: German - Profession: Physicist - Area of Specialization: Mass spectrometry and isotopic abundances - Major Contribution: Mattauch Isobar Rule, established in 1934 - Legacy: Influence on modern science, particularly in nuclear physics, chemistry, and environmental sciences - Context: Scientific advancements of the early and mid-20th century"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for his team. Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well; these players are known colloquially as combo guards. Kobe Bryant, for example, as a shooting guard was as good a playmaker as he was a scorer; other examples of combo guards are Dwyane Wade, Allen Iverson, James Harden, Jamal Crawford, Randy Foye and Jason Terry. A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman. Notable swing men (also known as wing players) include Jimmy Butler, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Joe Johnson, Andre Iguodala, Andrew Wiggins, Evan Turner and Tyreke Evans. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6' 4\\" (1.93 m) to 6' 7\\" (2.01 m).  - Kobe Bean Bryant (born August 23, 1978) is an American retired professional basketball player and businessman.

Indian farmers turn to Cola to kill pests Cotton farmers in some Indian villages are flocking to buy Coca-Cola and Pepsi, believing that the sugar in the fizzy drinks kills pests. Multi-choice problem: What is this text about? Choose from: A. World B. Sports C. Business D. Science/Tech","output":"D. Science/Tech This text is primarily about an unconventional approach taken by cotton farmers in some Indian villages in dealing with pests. The farmers believe that the sugar content found in Coca-Cola and Pepsi effectively kills pests, and as a result, they are purchasing these fizzy drinks for this purpose. While the topic is not specifically about technological advancements or discoveries, it falls under the broader Science/Tech category as it discusses agricultural practices and pest control methods. Although it might seem unusual, the use of Coca-Cola and Pepsi as pest control agents by these Indian cotton farmers may be a creative, low-tech solution to a common agricultural problem. India is a major producer of cotton, and pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and bollworms can cause significant damage to the crops if left unchecked. These farmers are likely in pursuit of a cost-effective, readily-available method to protect their cotton plants and increase their yield. The efficacy of sugary soft drinks in eliminating pests, however, remains debatable. The sugar content in Coca-Cola and Pepsi may indirectly contribute to pest control by creating a sticky, sweet residue that attracts ants. Some species of ants, such as the red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) and the common black garden ants (Lasius niger), are known to prey on sap-sucking insects that can damage cotton crops, including aphids and whiteflies. In this context, using sugary beverages to attract ants may have some merit. Additionally, the sugar in Coca-Cola and Pepsi may perhaps serve as a makeshift bait for pests when used in combination with an insecticidal agent. For example, some farmers may mix the soft drinks with boric acid, a common natural pesticide, to create a sweet, lethal solution for pests. The sugar would lure the pests to the poison, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the pest control method. Moreover, Coca-Cola and Pepsi contain other components, such as phosphoric acid and carbon dioxide, that could potentially contribute to pest control. Phosphoric acid, for instance, has been historically used as a rust remover, and it is toxic to some insects. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, might be employed as a suffocating agent for pests. It is important to note that the use of sugary soft drinks as pest control agents has not been scientifically proven to be effective. The practice may have some merit in attracting ants or providing a makeshift bait for pests in combination with an insecticide. However, there is no concrete evidence to support the idea that the sugar content in Coca-Cola or Pepsi alone is sufficient to kill agricultural pests. Further research and experimentation are necessary to validate or refute this unconventional farming practice, which falls under the broader Science/Tech category."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: 70 years after Hiroshima, Los Alamos remains essential to our national security Seventy years ago on July 16, scientists with the Manhattan Project tested the Trinity gadget—the first atomic bomb—in the desert outside of Alamogordo, NM. The pre-dawn flash of light that mimicked the noonday sun lit the surrounding mountains, illuminating the imminent end of World War II; it also signaled that humanity had entered a new Atomic Age that held great promise as well as great challenges ahead. The Trinity test was arguably among the greatest scientific and engineering achievements of the 20th Century. By assembling a collection of the greatest minds in the world, Los Alamos—along with the laboratories at Oak Ridge, TN, and Hanford, WA—created a bold model for multidisciplinary technical innovation. It is a model that Los Alamos and the 16 other national Laboratories under the U.S. Department of Energy sustain today. Since Trinity, Los Alamos has continued as an essential national-security science laboratory. Like their predecessors in the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos researchers help solve the nation’s most difficult national-security challenges. From Trinity to today, Los Alamos’ core mission remains ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nation’s nuclear deterrent, which many believe has helped prevent another global conflict. This challenge requires scientific excellence spanning nearly every discipline. The power of multidisciplinary science has been key to Los Alamos’ success for the past seven decades. In the years beyond Trinity, when other nations began testing their own nuclear arsenals, Los Alamos expertise again came to the fore to help monitor the activities of other nations to help ensure that promises made under the Limited Test Ban treaty, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, the Strategic Arms Reduction treaties, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, and others like them were honored. Scientific expertise from Los Alamos and elsewhere helped develop a network of satellites, sensors, and other technologies to ensure that nuclear ambitions on the part of any nation or individual would not go unnoticed. This vital service continues today. In September 1992, the United States conducted the Divider nuclear test. Since then, there have been no additional U.S. nuclear tests. Cessation of testing created a challenge perhaps even greater than development of the original atomic bomb. Nuclear weapons are incredibly complex, and many of their components are in a radioactive environment. Over time, plastics crack, materials suffer defects, and certain components reach the end of their engineered lifespan. In the absence of testing, our nation was faced with challenging questions about the safety, security, reliability, and effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent. To address these questions, research teams at Los Alamos and its sister laboratories again turned to multidisciplinary science. During the past 20 years of science-based stockpile stewardship, our nation’s top scientists have employed advanced computing techniques and modern experimental facilities to maintain confidence in certification of our deterrent. Multidisciplinary science has proven beneficial in other areas as well. In our vigilance to detect clandestine nuclear tests, Los Alamos researchers also discovered previously unknown natural phenomena that have helped us better understand our universe and protect satellites from the ravages of cosmic radiation. Computer and mathematical modeling techniques perfected at Los Alamos help keep tabs on pandemics, make off-shore oil rigs safer, and helped create a possible vaccine against HIV. Laser technology originally developed to detect nuclear materials here on Earth is now aboard the Curiosity rover to help NASA characterize the surface of Mars. Los Alamos makes the world a safer place by providing expertise and technology to help thwart a growing list of security concerns, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity, energy security, and much more. National laboratories like Los Alamos endure because our nation has made the wise decision to use agile multidisciplinary science teams as a hedge against global uncertainty. As long as our national laboratories exist, they can continue to serve our nation and help address its greatest challenges. Though the world has seen many changes since Trinity, one thing has remained constant: Los Alamos remains essential to our nation’s security. Dr. Charles F. McMillan is Director of Los Alamos National Laboratory.

In an interview for HitQuarters, Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his Achilles tendon and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer Ray LaMontagne was the primary inspiration for \\"Halo\\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \\"Shelter\\" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title \\"Halo\\" after hearing Tedder play \\"angelic\\" chords. They wrote the song in three hours.According to Simon Cowell, owner of the music production company Syco Entertainment, Bogart and Tedder intended \\"Halo\\" for his client, singer Leona Lewis, who could not record the song because of her tight schedule.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Namdev, also transliterated as Namdeo and Namadeva, (traditionally, c. 1270 - c. 1350) was a poet-saint from Maharashtra, India who is significant to the Varkari sect of Hinduism. He is also venerated in Sikhism, as well as Hindu warrior-ascetic traditions such as the Dadupanthis and the Niranjani Sampraday that emerged in north India during the Islamic rule. The details of Namdev's life are unclear. He is the subject of many miracle-filled hagiographies composed centuries after he died. Namdev's padas are not mere poems, according to Callewaert and Lath. Like other Bhakti movement sants, Namdev composed bhajans, that is songs meant to be sung to music. A Bhajan literally means \\"a thing enjoyed or shared\\". Namdev's songs were composed to be melodious and carry a spiritual message. They built on one among the many ancient Indian traditions for making music and singing. Namdev's bhajans, note Callewaert and Lath, deployed particular species of Raag, used Bhanita (or Chhap, a stamp of the composer's name inside the poem, in his case Nama), applied a Tek (or dhruva, repeated refrain) and a meter than helps harmonise the wording with the musical instrument, all according to Sangita manuals refined from the 8th to 13th centuries.  The musical genre of Namdev's literary works was a form of Prabandha - itself a very large and rich genre that includes dhrupad, thumri, tappa, geet, bhajan and other species. In some species of Indian music, it is the music that dominates while words and their meaning are secondary. In contrast, in Namdev's bhajan the spiritual message in the words has a central role, and the structure resonates with the singing and music. The songs and music that went with Namdev's works, were usually transmitted verbally across generations, in a guru-sisya-parampara (teacher-student tradition), within singing gharanas (family-like musical units).  Callewaert and Lath state that, \\"each single song of Namdev is a musical and textual unit and this unit is the basis for textual considerations\\". The unit contained Antaras, which are the smallest independent unit within that can be shifted around, dropped or added, without affecting the harmony or meaning, when a bhajan is being sung with music. In Namdev's songs, the dominant pattern is Caturasra, or an avarta with the 4x4 square pattern of musical matras (beat). Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"In simple words, Namdev was a special poet and saint from a long time ago in India, and people from different religions like him. He wrote lots of beautiful songs called bhajans that were meant to be sung with music and have a good message in them. These songs followed certain rules to make them sound nice with the music. People learned and shared these songs by singing them together in a special teacher-student way, passing them down through families. Namdev's songs are enjoyable to listen to and have deep meaning in them, which is why people still like and remember him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What is the name used when the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas close to the shore exposed? is inside the article: A tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave, a tsunami, radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water and which therefore travels much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. In the deep open sea, tsunamis have wavelengths of around 80 to 300 miles (130 to 480 km), travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (970 km/hr) and usually have a height of less than three feet, so they often pass unnoticed at this stage. In contrast, ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet, travel at up to 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) and are up to 45 feet (14 metres) high.A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually, but is spread out over the wave front, so as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will, on average, be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions, and this affects the direction of the wave front - an effect known as refraction - which can focus the strength of the advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography. As a tsunami moves into shallower water its speed decreases, its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously, behaving in the same way as a wind-generated wave in shallow water, but on a vastly greater scale.  Either the trough or the crest of a tsunami can arrive at the coast first...., can you guess it ?","output":"Yes, the name used when the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas close to the shore exposed is called \\"tsunami.\\" A tsunami is formed by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption, or a collapse of land into the sea.

You are given a new situation: Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture.  and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Please answer this question : Which farm causes more algae to grow out of control? A:","output":"Bold farm causes more algae to grow out of control. Step 1: Identify the factors causing algae growth The hint states that rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries the fertilizer into bodies of water, resulting in increased nitrogen content. The presence of nitrogen in water bodies creates an environment conducive to rapid algae growth. Step 2: Compare the agricultural methods Bold farm has been using large amounts of fertilizers over the years, whereas Shallow farm has relied on organic methods combined with permaculture techniques. This distinction suggests that Bold farm is more likely to contribute high levels of nitrogen to nearby water bodies due to its heavy reliance on fertilizers. Step 3: Assess the impact of both farms on algae growth Since it has been established that nitrogen from fertilizer runoff accelerates algae growth, and Bold farm employs extensive fertilizer use, we can conclude that Bold farm has a more significant impact on algal blooms. Shallow farm's organic and permaculture methods likely contribute less nitrogen to nearby water sources, leading to fewer instances of out-of-control algae growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Q:It takes years of school to develop math skills, but learning about numbers starts earlier than you might think. Now according to a new study, at three months, babies have already started acquiring a concept   of \\"how much\\". Previous research had suggested that very young babies can tell when the number of objects   in a group has changed. But the babies in these studies were simply reacting generally to the fact that something had changed, they suspected. Researchers of Harvard University studied 36 babies, all three months old. During the tests, each baby wore a hat with sensors  . The babies watched a series of images on a computer screen. _ showed the same object, such as a cartoon character. For a while, the number of the objects in the pictures didn't change. Then the images began to display a different object, or a different number of one of the objects the babies had previously looked at. As soon as something changed, the babies' brains responded with a specific pattern of electrical signals, which would be recorded by sensors. By analyzing these signals, the researchers discovered that one part of the brain (near the top on the left side) responded when the object in the image changed. A different part of the brain (lower and on the right side) responded when the number of objects in the image changed. This was not the area of the brain that is involved in attention. That suggests that the babies' brains are doing more than just reacting to a change in what they're seeing - they actually seem to be able to tell number changes from other types of changes. Numbers and amounts are important concepts in our lives. Even though babies are years away from adding, subtracting  , multiplying, and dividing, their brains seem to be preparing for a time when they finally will. The purpose of the study is to prove that  _  . A) math skills should be developed as early as possible B) numbers are easier for babies to judge than images C) babies really do have some sense of numbers D) babies can react differently to what they see A:","output":"The purpose of the study is to prove that C) babies really do have some sense of numbers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then he leaned over to scoop an arm under the torso , hoisted the body to his shoulder and stood up with a grunt . He glanced at Rin . \\" I need to take him a ways downriver so I do n't freak out the horses . This is gon na take a couple trips , considering how many bits he 's in . why did they have to not freak out the horses ?","output":"In the given passage, the character is handling a dismembered body, which is a sight that could potentially scare or unsettle the horses. Horses, as animals, are instinctively sensitive, and their reactions can sometimes be unpredictable when confronted with unusual or unexpected situations. Consequently, the character is attempting to avoid any distress or disturbance to the horses in order to prevent the following possible negative consequences: 1. Panic and Injuries: If the horses become frightened, they could start to panic, which might lead to them hurting themselves, others, or damaging their surroundings. An injured horse would be a significant concern as it could negatively impact their health and working ability. 2. Stress Response: When horses are anxious or frightened, they may exhibit a stress response that could adversely affect their overall health and wellbeing. Chronic stress in horses can lead to various health issues such as weight loss, ulcers, and a weakened immune system, which could ultimately hinder their ability to perform tasks efficiently. 3. Flight Instinct: Horses, being prey animals, have a strong flight instinct when they sense danger or fear. They might try to run away from the source of their anxiety, potentially putting themselves and others at risk. This flight instinct could lead to accidents, escape attempts, or other dangerous situations. 4. Difficulty in Handling: Freaked out horses can become challenging to handle, especially if they become skittish, jumpy, or agitated. This could make it difficult for the characters to carry out their tasks as they struggle to calm and control the horses. 5. Loss of Trust: Horses are known to develop trust in their handlers over time. If they get scared or disturbed by a situation and do not feel safe, they may lose trust in their handlers. This loss of trust could make future handling and interactions difficult. In summary, the character in the passage is taking precautions to avoid freaking out the horses with the sight of the dismembered body. This is necessary to prevent potential panic, stress, injuries, loss of trust, escape attempts, and overall difficulty in handling the horses, ensuring a smoother and safer working environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Finance Secretary Derek Mackay is negotiating with opposition MSPs to win backing for his budget. The Greens and Lib Dems have outlined changes which could win them over, on tax and spending respectively. MSPs voted on a Labour motion urging members to reject the budget \\"in its current form\\", but it was defeated. Mr Mackay successfully amended the motion to one supportive of the government after the Greens abstained, but all opposition parties then united against the amended motion. With the final vote tied at 63 to 63, the Presiding Officer's casting vote was against the motion, meaning nothing was agreed. With the SNP a minority government, Mr Mackay will need a handful of opposition members to at least abstain in order to get his budget through Holyrood. The draft budget bill will be published on Thursday, and there will be separate votes on the tax and spending proposals in February. Scottish Labour has put forward a debate seeking a cross-party consensus against the government's budget proposals. Deputy leader Alex Rowley said members had \\"the opportunity to send a message on the SNP's austerity budget\\". He said: \\"The SNP in government has all been about spin and the short term, but Scotland's sluggish economy is because of a decade of cuts to education budgets. Our NHS is overwhelmed because care for the elderly has been underfunded. \\"Labour has an alternate plan that would use the new powers of the Scottish Parliament to invest in our public services and grow our economy.\\" The finance secretary has indicated he could \\"not necessarily\\" find common ground with the Conservatives or Labour over the budget, but said discussions with the Lib Dems and Greens had shown \\"room for manoeuvre\\". The Lib Dems have asked for \\"substantial changes\\", with up to £400m of extra spending on mental health, education, the police and transport. The Greens, meanwhile, have asked for changes to income tax in return for their backing, which they say will \\"make the tax system fairer, reduce inequality in our society and generate additional funds for public services\\". During the debate, each party promoted its own plans, although amendments from Willie Rennie and Patrick Harvie were rejected in the final votes. The Conservatives, who also saw their amendment noting their position that \\"families and businesses in Scotland should not be taxed more than those elsewhere in the UK\\" defeated, criticised the pair as \\"Patsy Harvie and Willing Willie\\" for their attempt to \\"gain a few minutes of glory as saviours of the SNP budget\\". However, Mr Rennie said members had a responsibility to work constructively to strike a budget deal, warning that failure to do so could potentially end in an election, something he said people in Scotland did not want. Meanwhile, Mr Mackay lodged an amendment deleting the Labour motion in full, and noting that \\"government amendments to the budget reflecting the outcome of discussions with other parties can be made at any time during the scrutiny process\\", highlighting \\"constructive\\" discussions ongoing. Ahead of the debate, Labour highlighted figures in the budget showing the core funding going into council budgets falling by £327m, which they said was \\"cutting into our future\\". However, the SNP has said this does not take into account funding which will go direct to schools and health and social care partnerships, which they said would boost local services by several hundred million pounds. Mr Mackay has said Labour are \\"just wrong\\" about the budget and are working in a \\"Better Together alliance\\" with the Conservatives. He said: \\"What the Labour Party are proposing to do is vote with the Tories against the Scottish budget, and in that budget we're proposing to allocate hundreds of millions of pounds more for our public services - to the NHS, to education and to local services. \\"It's Labour that will be passing on austerity to the households of Scotland. \\"Scotland is a wealthy and successful nation. The threat to Scotland's economy right now is Brexit and the Scottish government has set out a plan to put Scotland in the best possible position.\\" Today's debate chiefly served to show how divided Holyrood is over the budget. Labour had hoped to find some consensus for their motion rejecting the current draft - and so did the SNP, via Derek Mackay's amendment pointing out that the current draft is subject to change, pending negotiation. Mr Mackay won round one, thanks to the Greens abstaining, but there was no consensus at the end of the day. So what does this mean for the budget? The signs were not particularly encouraging. Willie Rennie, who I still regard as the most likely partner for Mr Mackay in a budget deal, said there remains a \\"huge gap\\" between the Lib Dems and the SNP over the budget. Patrick Harvie, the other leading suitor, said he hadn't seen any willingness to compromise from the government - and warned Mr Mackay about \\"brinksmanship\\". Mr Harvie again underlined that his key demand is over tax. While nothing is set in stone, Derek Mackay is fairly determined not to compromise over tax - which is why I still see the Lib Dems, whose proposals are for spending, in pole position. But equally, Mr Rennie has set a high price - £400m - and is determined not to sell his votes too cheaply. If this vote serves to do anything, it may have upped the ante in the backroom negotiations.","output":"Finance secretary Derek Mackay is negotiating with opposition parties in an attempt to secure backing for his budget, with the Green and Liberal Democrat parties outlining the changes that they require in return for their support."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? When you first create your new Prezi, you will be asked to choose a template. The template of your Prezi defines how the text, colors and objects will all interact on the landscape. You can pick between 2D and 3D template. 2D themes are flat and the camera moves across the canvas. 3D themes allow you to zoom in and out of the background.  Think of the template as a metaphor for what you are presenting. For example, if you are talking about surmounting obstacles to get where you are, choose the template of the mountain climbers. Avoid changing your theme after setting up your Prezi. The changes will push all of your text and objects out-of-whack. Pick a theme in the beginning and stick with it. You can turn a 2D background into a 3D one by right-clicking on a 2D theme and selecting “Change background”. Click on the Edit button next to the 3D option and you will be able to add up to 3 images that can be zoomed between. You can use the same “Change background” option to open the Theme Wizard, which will allow you to adjust the colors of the elements in your Prezi. Be sure to begin with the main points of your presentation. These will be the centerpieces of each section. You can add text, images, and other objects anywhere on the canvas. Continue to refer to your plan as you begin laying out the Prezi on the screen. To add text, simply double click anywhere in your Prezi.

This means that lower quality images that look good as a part of a webpage will look grainy when they are scaled up to fit the screen. If you leave a fair amount of white space around your objects, Prezi will be able to easily focus on them when the camera zooms in. This will help make the text or image stand out to the audience. If you want to surprise the audience with a fact or image, make it very small. This will make it illegible until the object is in focus. If the text is small enough, the audience won’t even see it coming. Frames come in two forms in Prezi: visible and invisible. Visible frames highlight the object on the screen, and include a circle, brackets, and a filled oblong shape. Invisible frames allow you to define objects and sets of objects as the focus. Both types of frames will let you control how much zoom and object receives. Invisible frames also allow you to create clickable sections of your presentation that can link to other parts of the Prezi or to the web. This is perfect for interactive presentations.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/0/0d/Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} If you have a paragraph of text in one frame, and want to highlight a key segment of it, create a frame around the text that you want to highlight. Create a path to it, and the camera will zoom in on just the framed text. This is useful for noting key figures or powerful phrases in a block of text. Prezi doesn’t use font sizes, which can make it difficult to get headings and paragraphs to feel uniform. In order to match size, select the text that you need to resize. As you move the mouse to change the size of the text, look at the text that you are trying to match it to. Once the two are the same, the text that you haven't selected will become darker, signifying that the two are the same size.  You can use this same procedure for matching the size of pictures and other objects.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6b/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/6/6b/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"}  You can see when sections are aligned when a dotted blue line appears between the two.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e1/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/e/e1/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} A good Prezi will be able to be understood when the presentation is zoomed all the way out. This means that your key points should be large enough to be read when the camera is pulled back. They should also be aligned in a way that makes logical sense. You can return to the overview by creating an invisible frame around the entire project. Link to this frame when you want to pull back and show the whole project. This is especially useful when transitioning between major points.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9a/Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/9/9a/Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} If you are using specific styles of frames to highlight your important ideas, stick to using those throughout your entire presentation. The same goes for colored text and other stylistic objects. A sense of design unity throughout the presentation will leave a stronger lasting impression and convey information more clearly.","output":"When you start a new Prezi presentation, you pick a template with colors, text, and designs, then you add main points of your talk, text, images or other items anywhere on the 'canvas', and can also change sizes, move or rotate them, decide how much you zoom in on them, and line them up neatly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: This article: In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person the Kinks third album was named after?, what is it ?

King made that clear in a finger-waving display worthy of Dikembe Mutombo as she disparaged the Russian for doping.

Given the below context:  Palmyra (; Palmyrene:  Tadmor; Arabic: تَدْمُر‎ Tadmur) is an ancient Semitic city in present-day Homs Governorate, Syria. Archaeological finds date back to the Neolithic period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century AD. The city grew wealthy from trade caravans; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of Amorites, Arameans, and Arabs. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke Palmyrene (a dialect of Aramaic), while using Greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes. Greco-Roman culture influenced the culture of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic deities, Mesopotamian and Arab gods. By the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic. Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017, file photo, President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka walk to board Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington. Ivanka Trump's company continues... (Associated Press)      SHANGHAI (AP) — On April 6, Ivanka Trump's company won provisional approval from the Chinese government for three new trademarks, giving it monopoly rights to sell Ivanka brand jewelry, bags and spa services in the world's second-largest economy. That night, the first daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, sat next to the president of China and his wife for a steak and Dover sole dinner at Mar-a-Lago.      The scenario underscores how difficult it is for the president's daughter, who has tried to distance herself from the brand that bears her name, to separate business from politics in her new position at the White House.      As she crafts a political career from her West Wing office, her brand is flourishing, despite boycotts and several stores limiting her merchandise. U.S. imports, almost all of them from China, shot up an estimated 166 percent last year, while sales hit record levels in 2017. The brand, which Ivanka Trump still owns, says distribution is growing.      It has launched new activewear and affordable jewelry lines and is working to expand its global intellectual property footprint. In addition to winning the approvals from China, Ivanka Trump Marks LLC applied for at least nine new trademarks in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Canada and the U.S. after the election.      The commercial currents of the Trump White House are unprecedented in modern American politics, ethics lawyers say. They have created an unfamiliar landscape riven with ethical pitfalls, and forced consumers and retailers to wrestle with the unlikely passions now inspired by Ivanka Trump's mid-market collection of ruffled blouses, shifts and wedges.      Using the prestige of government service to build a brand is not illegal. But criminal conflict-of-interest law prohibits federal officials, like Ivanka Trump and her husband, from participating in government matters that could impact their own financial interest or that of their spouses. Some argue that the more her business broadens its scope, the more it threatens to encroach on the ability of two trusted advisers to deliver credible counsel to the president on core issues like trade, intellectual property and the value of Chinese currency.      \\"Put the business on hold and stop trying to get trademarks while you're in government,\\" advises Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush.      To address ethical concerns, Ivanka Trump has shifted the brand's assets to a family-run trust valued at more than 50 million and pledged to recuse herself from issues that present conflicts. She is also no longer running her design business and has given day-to-day responsibility to Abigail Klem, president of the brand. Meanwhile, her husband has taken steps to distance himself from his sprawling New York real estate business, divesting some of his business interests including his stake in a major Fifth Avenue skyscraper.      \\"Ivanka will not weigh in on business strategy, marketing issues or the commercial terms of agreements,\\" her attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said in a statement. \\"She has retained authority to direct the trustees to terminate agreements that she determines create a conflict of interest or the appearance of one.\\"      In a recent interview with CBS News, Trump argued that her business would be doing even better if she hadn't moved to Washington and placed restrictions on her team to ensure that \\"any growth is done with extreme caution.\\"      China, however, remains a nagging concern.      \\"Ivanka has so many China ties and conflicts, yet she and Jared appear deeply involved in China contacts and policy. I would never have allowed it,\\" said Norman Eisen, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under Barack Obama. \\"For their own sake, and the country's, Ivanka and Jared should consider stepping away from China matters.\\"      Instead, the first daughter and her husband have emerged as prominent interlocutors with China, where they have both had significant business ties. Last year, Kushner pursued hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate investments from Anbang Insurance Group, a financial conglomerate with close ties to the Chinese state. After media reports about the deal, talks were called off.      Publicly, Ivanka Trump has taken a gracious, charming approach toward Beijing. During the Mar-a-Lago meetings, her daughter, 5-year-old Arabella, stood in a gilded room and sang a traditional Chinese song, in Mandarin, for China's president, Xi Jinping. The video, which was lavishly praised by Chinese state media, played over 2.2 million times on China's popular news portal qq.com.      The week of the summit, 3.4 tons of Ivanka Trump handbags, wallets and blouses arrived in the U.S. from Hong Kong and Shanghai. U.S. imports of her merchandise grew an estimated 40 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Panjiva Inc., which maintains and analyzes global shipping records.      Painter, the former Bush administration lawyer, recommended full recusal from issues related to trade with China. That is likely to be difficult because trade is so deeply embedded in the US-China relationship and has been linked with other matters, like North Korea.      \\"The danger is that with any discussion with the Chinese, one party or the other may try to bring up trade,\\" he said. \\"That's a slippery slope that may require her or Jared to step out of the room.\\"      Gorelick, Ivanka Trump's attorney, said that she and her husband would steer clear of specific areas that could impact her business, or be seen as conflicts of interest, but are under no legal obligation to step back from huge swaths of policy, like trade with China.      Under the rules, Trump would recuse herself from conversations about duties on clothing imported from China, Gorelick said, but not broad foreign policy.      \\"In between, you have to assess it case-by-case,\\" she said.      Trademarks can be signs of corporate ambition, though many countries — such as China, where \\"trademark squatting\\" is rampant — also allow for defensive filings to prevent copycats from using a brand.      Trademarks pose ethical, and possibly legal, implications for government employees because they are granted by foreign states and confer the monopoly right to sell branded products in a particular country — an entitlement that can be enormously valuable. Intellectual property lawyers say trademarks are also a crucial prerequisite for cutting licensing deals, which form the basis of both Ivanka and Donald Trump's global business strategy.      \\"The brand has filed, updated, and rigorously protected its international trademarks over the past several years in the normal course of business, especially in regions where trademark infringement is rampant,\\" said Klem in a statement.      Today, Ivanka Trump Marks LLC has 16 registered trademarks in China and 32 pending applications, along with a total of four marks granted preliminary approval since the inauguration, according to China's Trademark Office. Altogether, they cover a wide range of goods and services, including cosmetics, jewelry, leather handbags, luggage, clothes, shoes, retail, spa and beauty services. There is no sign the recent approvals were particularly swift. China's Trademark Office did not respond to a request for comment.      Globally, the company has more than 180 pending and registered trademarks in countries including Canada, India, Japan, Israel, Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, as well as the U.S. and Europe, public records show. In December, the company applied for five trademarks, covering handbags and wallets in Puerto Rico, and lingerie and other clothes in the U.S. After the inauguration, the company filed four more applications, for branded clothing and shoes in the Philippines, and perfume and other items in Canada.      Ivanka Trump did not sign off on the new trademark applications, her brand said in a statement, adding that they are \\"not necessarily an indication that the brand is planning to launch a category or a store in a specific territory.\\"      Whatever the future plans, right now sales are growing — helped, some argue, by the glow of Ivanka Trump's political rise.      The G-III Apparel Group Ltd., which makes Ivanka Trump clothes, said net sales for the collection increased by 17.9 million during the year that ended Jan. 31.      The overall brand itself says revenues rose 21 percent last year, with early February seeing some of the \\"best performance ever,\\" according to a statement by Klem. Because it is privately held, the brand does not have to declare its earnings or where revenues come from. The actual corporate structure of Trump's retail business remains opaque. Kushner's financial disclosure form lists two dozen corporate entities that appear directly related to his wife's brand. Trump herself has yet to file a disclosure.      Data from Lyst, a massive fashion e-commerce platform, indicates some of this growth coincided with specific political events.      The number of Ivanka Trump items sold through Lyst was 46 percent higher the month her father was elected president than in November 2015. Sales spiked 771 percent in February over the same month last year, after White House counselor Kellyanne Conway exhorted Fox viewers to \\"Go buy Ivanka's stuff.\\" Conway was later reprimanded. The bounce appears somewhat sustained. March sales on Lyst were up 262 percent over the same period last year.      \\"You can't separate Ivanka from her role in life and from her business,\\" said Allen Adamson, founder of BrandSimpleConsulting. \\"Her celebrity status is now not only being fueled by her wealth and her family connection, but by her huge role in the White House. All that buzz is hardwired to her products.\\" That, he added, is a competitive advantage other brands just can't match — though it does come with risk.      Things could easily cut the other way for the first daughter. Ashley King, 28 of Calabasas, California, bought Ivanka Trump black flats and a cardigan several years ago. But King, who voted for Hillary Clinton, said she believes Trump's role in the White House represents a conflict of interest.      \\"This is bothering me more and more,\\" she said.

Follow Kinetz on Twitter at twitter.com/ekinetz ||||| LONDON — Ivanka Trump calls her father a homebody. “If it were up to him, he’d seldom leave New York,” she once wrote.      By contrast, she has been her family’s leading globalist — doing deals around the world in her father’s name and her own. Even since her father took office, her own fashion brand has continued to look abroad, filing four new trademarks in Canada and the Philippines, according to a New York Times analysis of trademark records.      The continued activity is tricky territory for Ms. Trump’s new job as White House adviser. While she has stepped down from both her own fashion company and from the Trump Organization and put her brand in a trust, she has not given up her financial control, an unusual situation to navigate now that she is subject to federal ethics rules on conflicts of interest.      Even though many of her trademark applications were filed long before she took her government job, they could be decided on by foreign governments while she works in the White House, creating ethical issues with little precedent. While trademarks do not directly confer financial gains, they protect the use of logos and other intellectual property, making them valuable tools for companies looking to build new ventures or expand existing operations. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Ivanka Trump's company has secured preliminary approval from the Chinese government for three new trademarks, giving her brand monopoly rights to sell jewelry, bags and spa services in China.

This news comes in response to various corruption allegations that have plagued the organization, which have led to significant investigations at both national and international levels. Background of FIFA's Corruption Scandal The FIFA corruption scandal first came to light in 2015 when numerous high-ranking FIFA officials were arrested on charges of corruption, fraud, money laundering, and other criminal activities. Since then, the controversy has intensified, with more individuals joining the list of those implicated in bribery and other financial crimes. Throughout this time, there have been multiple investigations carried out by law enforcement agencies from different countries. The United States Department of Justice has spearheaded much of this effort, with cooperation from authorities in Switzerland, Brazil, Germany, and other nations. These investigations have exposed a complex web of corruption, involving FIFA officials, marketing executives, and representatives of national and regional football associations. Efforts to Recover Stolen Funds FIFA has voiced its determination to recover the tens of millions of dollars that were allegedly taken illegally from its coffers. Central to these efforts is a massive legal claim that FIFA filed with U.S. District Court in New York, in which it has identified various individuals, businesses, and organizations that it accuses of illegally siphoning its funds. In the claim, FIFA demands the return of funds that were allegedly paid out as bribes and kickbacks, along with any profits generated by these illegal transactions. This includes money paid to high-ranking officials, such as former FIFA vice-presidents Jeffrey Webb and Eugenio Figueredo, as well as payments made to football organizations in exchange for promotion and marketing rights. To bolster its claim, FIFA has submitted extensive documentation to support its allegations, including financial records, internal communications, and testimony from key witnesses. These exhibits are expected to play a critical role in the unfolding legal battle, providing vital evidence of the malfeasance that has occurred within the organization's ranks over the years. Challenges Facing FIFA in Recovering Stolen Funds While FIFA's initiative to recover its stolen funds is commendable, the organization faces several challenges in this undertaking. First, the vast majority of the accused parties are not currently residing in the United States, and therefore may not be subject to U.S. jurisdiction. To address this issue, FIFA will likely have to rely on international cooperation and the use of extradition treaties. Second, the identification and tracing of the stolen funds are likely to be arduous processes, given the complex channels through which the money would have flowed. FIFA will have to work closely with law enforcement agencies in various countries, leveraging the experience and resources of these organizations to gather the necessary information. Lastly, FIFA will need to contend with issues surrounding its credibility, given that these scandals unfolded on its watch. In the eyes of many critics, the organization's oversight mechanisms failed to detect and prevent these corrupt practices for several years, casting doubt on FIFA's capacity to effectively govern the sport. Conclusion FIFA's ongoing attempts to reclaim the tens of millions of dollars that were illegally taken by its officials and other football organizations serve as a reminder of the challenges that still lie ahead for the embattled governing body. However, these efforts also send a strong message that FIFA is committed to cleaning up its act, enforcing greater transparency, and holding those who exploited the beautiful game accountable. Ultimately, FIFA's success in reclaiming its stolen funds—and more importantly, rebuilding trust with football fans around the world—will depend on the organization's ability to learn from its past mistakes and implement meaningful reforms moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive.  Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money.  When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs. However, no matter what tricks they did or how hard they tried, Bess and Harry were not doing well. They tried to sell their shows for seven years and finally, in desperation, they went to Europe.           It was the right move. Harry's persistence and...

Porky and a rival neighbor both plan to win the agricultural farm prize, Porky with his garden and the neighbor with his chickens. Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere. Porky grabs his bottle of quick grow, a hair tonic he hopes would work on his garden. To his amazement, it does. But he says nothing of it and heads inside his house. The neighbor checks out his handy work and comments on it, allowing his chickens to come over and eat all of his fruits and vegetables. A little chick and a bigger chicken fight over a watermelon until it flings the chick away. The chick sadly retreats until it sees a bunch of spinach and decides to munch on it instead. The chick then comes back and punches the mean chicken before finishing the watermelon. (The chick eating spinach and then changing is a thinly-veiled Popeye reference). When his garden has almost entirely been eaten, Porky finally notices the chickens and tries to get rid of them. But alas no luck, so he yells at the neighbor to get them back into his yard but the neighbor claims he doesn't know how they got on Porky's property, then attempts to \\"try\\" and make them return. He then leaves while a sad Porky heads to his door, only to find a long vine and follow it to a giant pumpkin. contains an answer for the question: Which character allowed the chickens to eat from the garden?, what is it ?

Given the following context:  The Smashing Pumpkins' distinctive sound up until Adore involved layering numerous guitar tracks onto a song during the recording process, a tactic that Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness coproducer Flood called the \\"Pumpkin guitar overdub army.\\" Although there were a lot of overdubbed parts on Gish, Corgan began to really explore the possibilities of overdubbing with Siamese Dream; Corgan has stated that \\"Soma\\" alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts. While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert (in fact, some songs were drastically altered for live performance), he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question \\"When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song, why not endow it with the grandest possible vision?\\" This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan's love of 1970s popular artists & bands such as: David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Queen, Boston, and the Electric Light Orchestra, as well as shoegaze, a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect. Mellon Collie coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix Siamese Dream because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive.Like many contemporary alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. Hüsker Dü's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated to the band how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central to the pursuit of his grand musical ambitions. Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, \\"Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is what it sounds like on Planet Pumpkin.\\" This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to Adore (described as \\"arcane night music\\" in prerelease promotion)...  answer the following question:  Whose album did Flood co-produce?

Answer:","output":"Before the introduction of the Euro on 1 January 2002, the country that had the lira as its basic currency unit was Italy. The Italian lira, denoted as \\"₤\\" or \\"ITL,\\" was the national currency that served Italy from its inception as a unified state in 1861 until the adoption of the Euro. The name \\"lira\\" is derived from the Latin word \\"libra,\\" which means \\"pound.\\" This term was used to denote both weight and currency, and it originated in the ancient Roman Empire. The Italian lira was subdivided into 100 centesimi, but due to inflation, centesimo coins gradually disappeared from circulation in the latter years of the lira. Throughout its history, the lira faced numerous challenges, including economic crises, high inflation rates, and currency devaluations. For many years, the Banca d'Italia, Italy's central bank, managed the circulation and value of the lira by setting interest rates and intervening in the foreign exchange market when necessary. Throughout the 20th century, the lira experienced a significant loss in value due to various factors, including the two World Wars, political instability, and economic mismanagement. The currency devaluations in the 1970s and 1990s further contributed to its decline, leading to the popular desire for a more stable currency. As part of the European Union's efforts to introduce a single currency, Italy started preparing for the Euro's adoption in the 1990s, known as the European Monetary Union (EMU) project. The Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1992, set criteria that EU member states needed to meet to become part of the Eurozone, which included requirements relating to inflation, debt levels, and interest rates. Italy managed to meet these criteria and transitioned to the Euro in two phases. The first phase began on 1 January 1999, when the European Central Bank (ECB) assumed monetary policy authority and introduced the Euro as an electronic currency. During this time, the Euro served as Italy's official accounting currency, and the value of the lira was irrevocably pegged to the Euro at an exchange rate of ₤1,936.27 to €1. The physical banknotes and coins of the Euro were introduced on 1 January 2002, during the second phase. People in Italy and other Eurozone countries were given a short period to exchange their old currencies, such as the Italian lira, for the new Euro at the predetermined exchange rate. Since the introduction of the Euro in 2002, the Italian lira has ceased to be a legal tender and has been replaced by the Euro as Italy's official currency. The Euro’s adoption was intended to provide numerous benefits including economic stability, reduced transaction costs, and increased trade and investment opportunities among Eurozone member countries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - You inhale - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again.  Question: suppose air is cleared in the lung happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the process step-by-step and justify each step for better understanding. 1. You inhale: When you inhale, you breathe in air that contains oxygen. 2. Your diaphragm moves down: As you inhale, your diaphragm contracts and moves downward, creating more space for your lungs to expand. 3. Your lungs have more room: With the diaphragm moving down, your lungs can expand and take in more air. 4. Your lungs fill with air: Oxygen-rich air fills your lungs. 5. You exhale: After the oxygen from the air is taken up by your blood, you exhale the remaining carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular metabolism. 6. Your diaphragm moves back up: When you exhale, your diaphragm relaxes and moves up, making your lungs smaller and forcing out the air. 7. Carbon dioxide is exhaled: As your lungs expel air, carbon dioxide leaves your body. 8. You start the process over again: The process begins anew as you inhale fresh oxygen-rich air. Now, let's consider the scenario where air is cleared in the lungs. If the clearing results in a smaller amount of oxygen being present in the lungs, it will lead to: B: Less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Justification: If there is a smaller amount of oxygen available in the lungs due to the clearing, the diffusion of oxygen into the bloodstream will be reduced. Consequently, less oxygen will be delivered to the cells throughout the body, impacting cellular metabolism and overall energy production."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Frank's parcel is a pine forest, while Brad's is a nice dry grassland with wild flowers and  a few shrubs.  But I can use this background: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.  What is an answer for this question: Which parcel doesn't have a rich diversity of large trees?

Select from the following. a). hold child to  lap . b). fix lap desk.","output":"In terms of naive physics reasoning, the solution that is more sound would be: b). fix lap desk. Naive physics reasoning is based on the commonsense understanding of how the physical world works, often derived from casual observations and experiences. In this context, we can compare the two options given: a). hold child to lap. While it may be intuitive to hold children on one's lap, this option is not about fixing anything, and there is no mention of screws in the solution. Furthermore, depending on the situation, the child might be too heavy or restless, making it difficult for the person to hold the child on their lap for an extended period of time. This option does not seem to rely on naive physics reasoning. b). fix lap desk. In this context, \\"fixing\\" a lap desk can be understood as repairing or maintaining the structural integrity of the furniture. This solution is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, as it involves the use of screws to ensure the stability and functionality of the lap desk. Screws are an effective way to connect and secure different parts of an object, providing resistance against separation caused by external forces. Using screws is a practical and appropriate solution when dealing with physical objects and maintaining their structural integrity. Additionally, this option explicitly mentions \\"lap desk,\\" indicating that the task would involve working with a physical object, which is more relevant to the objective requiring knowledge of screws. The solution to \\"fix lap desk\\" involves the potential use of screws, making it align better with naive physics reasoning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was founded in 1876 by Melvil Dewey (familiar as the inventor of the Dewey decimal system). It reports news about the library world, emphasizing public libraries, and offers feature articles about aspects of professional practice. It also reviews library-related materials and equipment.  Its \\"Library Journal Book Review\\" does pre-publication reviews of several hundred popular and academic books each month.  \\"Library Journal\\" has the highest circulation of any librarianship journal, according to Ulrich's — approximately 100,000.  \\"Library Journal's\\" original publisher was Frederick Leypoldt, whose company became R. R. Bowker. Reed International (now Reed Business Information) purchased Bowker in 1985; they published \\"Library Journal\\" until 2010, when it was sold to Media Source, owner of the Junior Library Guild and \\"The Horn Book Magazine\\".  Founded in 1876 by Melvil Dewey, \\"Library Journal\\" originally declared itself to be the \\"official organ of the library associations of America and of the United Kingdom.\\" Indeed, the journal's original title was \\"American Library Journal\\", though \\"American\\" was removed from the title after the first year. Its early issues focused on the growth and development of libraries, with feature articles by such prominent authors as R. R. Bowker, Charles Cutter, and Melvil Dewey, and focusing on cataloging, indexing, and lending schemes. In its early issues, Bowker discussed cataloging principles; Cutter, creator of the Cutter Expansive Classification system, developed his ideas; and managing editor Dewey made recommendations for early library circulation systems. Initially, \\"Library Journal\\" did not review books unless they related to librarians' professional interests, but then, like now, the journal ran articles on collection development and ads from publishers recommending their forthcoming books for libraries to purchase. Answer this series of questions: 1. Who first published \\"Library Journals?\\" 2. What's his company now called? 3. And prior to that name, what was it called? 4. When did they stop publishing \\"Library Journal?\\" 5. When was it created? 6. By whom? 7. What did he name it at that time? 8. And which of those words did they take out? 9.

Write some highlights for the following article: The rift between teachers and Michael Gove widened yesterday when a moderate teachers’ union passed a motion of no confidence in the Education Secretary for the first time in its history. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers voted overwhelmingly that Mr Gove and Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw showed an ‘abject failure to improve education or treat teachers, parents and pupils with respect’. More militant unions regularly show dissatisfaction with Government policies in similar debates. But the ATL’s support for the first such motion in its 129 years indicates a hardening of opinion among  teachers and other school staff. Teachers from the ATL union passed a vote of no confidence in Education Secretary Michael Gove (left) and Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw. The two biggest unions – the National. Union of Teachers and the NASUWT – have already announced strike action. over pay, conditions and pensions. There is also anger at Mr Gove’s attempts to toughen exams and get rid of ‘trendy’ methods he believes have lowered standards. ATL member Jean Roberts said teachers. were overstretched and ‘bullying by the two Michaels’ was affecting head. teachers, ‘who seem to feel they have to hand that down to staff’. She. added: ‘We are saying enough is enough.’ Teacher Chrissie Jolinon, from Brent,. north-west London, said teachers were not consulted about changes. She. accused Sir Michael of ‘tinkering’ to ‘drive forward Government policy. for academies’. Earlier, general secretary Dr Mary. Bousted told the conference in  Liverpool that Mr Gove was ‘shamefully. neglecting’ children, and his reforms would damage education, leaving. morale at ‘rock bottom’. She added: ‘In 2013, every aspect of the. curriculum you teach, the qualifications you prepare children to take,. is under attack and review.’ ‘Michael Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw are like Blood Brothers, with a. pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system and the. teachers who work within it.’ The union’s survey of 996 members on Mr Gove’s performance found 91 per cent rated him a ‘fail’. Three-quarters criticised his. curriculum revisions, which focus on basic maths and English and a. chronological approach to history. ATL general secretary Mary Bousted said Michael Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system. Changes to GCSEs and A-levels, such as. ditching modules in favour of final exams, are also unpopular. Meanwhile, 60 per cent thought chief schools inspector Sir Michael. should be on ‘special measures’. The NUT and NASUWT last week announced strikes beginning on June 27 and culminating in a national strike before Christmas. They have said they will postpone them if Mr Gove attends constructive talks and delays introducing performance-related pay. Days later, 100 Left-wing academics. wrote to two national papers claiming pupils were doomed to ‘failure and. demoralisation’ under the proposed curriculum, which is out for. consultation until next month. An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘Sir Michael. has said from the outset any provision that is less than good is not. acceptable. That’s a tough message, especially for those schools and. colleges that have been coasting.’ A Department for Education spokesman. said: ‘We need to make sure we have an education system that is robust. and rigorous . This ambition is surely something the ATL should be. supporting.’","output":"A teacher's union called Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) has shown they have no confidence in Education Secretary Michael Gove and Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw. This is the first time ever that the ATL has done this. This means that the teachers in the union are not happy with how Mr. Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw are treating teachers, parents, and students. A lot of the teachers feel that they are not being listened to about changes happening in schools. Teachers also say that the changes in exams and curriculum are not good for the students. Two other big teacher unions are going on strike to show they are unhappy with the way things are being handled in schools."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Pete Maravich was born to Petar \\"Press\\" Maravich (1915-1987) and Helen Gravor Maravich (1925-1974) in Aliquippa, a steel town in Beaver County in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding father-son relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravich's father was the son of Serbian immigrants and a former professional player-turned-coach. The Utah Jazz began play in the 1979-80 season. Maravich moved with the team to Salt Lake City, but his knee problems were worse than ever. He appeared in 17 games early in the season, but his injuries prevented him from practicing much, and new coach Tom Nissalke had a strict rule that players who didn't practice were not allowed to play in games. Thus, Maravich was parked on the bench for 24 straight games, much to the dismay of Utah fans and to Maravich himself. During that time, Adrian Dantley emerged as the team's franchise player.  The Jazz placed Maravich on waivers in January 1980. He signed with the Celtics, the top team in the league that year, led by rookie superstar Larry Bird. Maravich adjusted to a new role as part-time contributor, giving Boston a \\"hired gun\\" off the bench. He helped the team post a 61-21 record in the regular season, best in the league. And, for the first time since his early career in Atlanta, Maravich was able to participate in the NBA playoffs. He appeared in nine games during that postseason, but the Celtics were upended by Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference finals, four games to one.  Realizing that his knee problems would never go away, Maravich retired at the end of that season. The NBA instituted the 3-point shot just in time for Maravich's last season in the league. He had always been famous for his long-range shooting, and his final year provided an official statistical gauge of his abilities. Between his limited playing time in Utah and Boston, he made 10 of 15 3-point shots, giving him a career 67% completion rate behind the arc.  During his ten-year career in the NBA, Maravich played in 658 games, averaging 24.2 points and 5.4 assists per contest.

During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Wedding\\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as \\"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Context: Mielke was then put on trial for ordering the shootings of East Germans who were trying to defect to the West. In November 1994, the presiding judge closed the proceedings, ruling that Mielke was not mentally fit to stand trial.  During his incarceration, at JVA Moabit corrections officers supplied Mielke with a red telephone like the one in his office at Stasi Headquarters. Although it was not connected to the outside world, Mielke enjoyed having imaginary conversations with non-existent Stasi agents. His other favorite pastime was watching game shows on television.  In 1995, parole officers and Mielke's attorneys argued that he was \\"totally confused\\" and obtained his release. At 87 years of age, Erich Mielke was Germany's oldest prison inmate and had been incarcerated for 1,904 days. Days before his release, the Public Prosecutor of Berlin announced that he was \\"not interested in chasing an 87 year old man anymore\\" and that all further prosecution of Mielke had been indefinitely suspended.  According to Koehler:  [Mielke's] bank account, which held more than 300,000 marks (about US 187,500), was confiscated. Before his arrest in 1989, the most feared man in East Germany had lived in a luxurious home with access to an indoor pool. In addition, he owned a palatial hunting villa, complete with a movie theater, trophy room, 60 servants, and a 15,000 acre hunting preserve. After he was released from prison Mielke was obliged to move into a two room, 600-square-foot flat. Like all Stasi pensioners, he would henceforth have to live on 802 marks (about US512) a month. Question: What crime was he convicted of?. Whats the answer?","output":"Erich Mielke was convicted of ordering the shootings of East Germans who were trying to escape to the West. In simple words, he was in trouble for telling people to shoot those who wanted to leave East Germany and go to West Germany."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Text: Life imprisonment (also known as imprisonment for life, life in prison, a life sentence, a life term, lifelong incarceration, life incarceration or simply life) is any sentence of imprisonment for a crime under which convicted persons are to remain in prison either for the rest of their natural life or until paroled. Crimes for which depending on a country a person could receive this sentence include murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, blasphemy, apostasy, terrorism, severe child abuse, rape, child rape, espionage, treason, high treason, drug dealing, drug trafficking, drug possession, human trafficking, severe cases of fraud, severe cases of financial crimes, aggravated criminal damage in English law, and aggravated cases of arson, kidnapping, burglary, or robbery which result in death or grievous bodily harm, piracy, aircraft hijacking, and in certain cases genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, certain war crimes or any three felonies in case of three strikes law. Life imprisonment (as a maximum term) can also be imposed, in certain countries, for traffic offenses causing death. This sentence does not exist in all countries and Portugal was the first to abolish life imprisonment, in 1884. Question: can someone with a life sentence get parole?","output":"Yes, someone with a life sentence can sometimes get parole. Parole means that they are allowed to leave prison before their sentence is completely finished, but they still must follow some rules and be supervised. It depends on the country and the specific laws about parole for life sentences. So, while serving a life sentence, there is a chance for a person to be allowed out of prison early if they show good behavior and meet certain conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? of low-budget filmmaking","output":"The phrase \\"of low-budget filmmaking\\" can be considered as both positive or negative, depending on the context and the perspective from which it is being viewed. Here, I will provide a detailed analysis of the positive and negative aspects associated with low-budget filmmaking. Positive aspects: 1. Creative freedom: Low-budget filmmaking often offers greater creative freedom for the filmmakers, as they are less likely to be restricted by studio demands or commercial interests. This allows them to experiment with ideas and techniques that might not be viable or considered safe in a high-budget film, resulting in unique and fresh stories. 2. Accessibility: Low-budget filmmaking can be more accessible and inclusive, opening up opportunities for amateurs, young filmmakers, and those from diverse backgrounds who might not have the resources or connections to break into the industry through traditional means. 3. Innovation: The limited resources available in low-budget filmmaking can inspire innovation. Filmmakers have to find cost-effective ways to tell their stories, which can lead to the development of new techniques, technology, or ideas. Some iconic films and genres, such as the \\"found footage\\" genre popularized by \\"The Blair Witch Project,\\" have originated from low-budget filmmaking. 4. Cult following: Low-budget films tend to attract a more niche audience, creating a devoted and loyal fan base. Many films that are initially met with little commercial success can develop a cult following over time. Independent or low-budget films have the potential to become cultural touchstones and can achieve critical acclaim. 5. Highlighting social issues: Many low-budget films revolve around social issues, offering voices and perspectives that might not be found in commercial or mainstream films. These films can raise awareness, spark debate, and help bring attention to important concerns. Negative aspects: 1. Poor production quality: One of the primary drawbacks of low-budget filmmaking is the potential for compromised production quality. Filmmakers may not have access to the best equipment, locations, or cast and crew, which could result in substandard visuals, sound, or performances. 2. Limited resources: With a smaller budget, filmmakers face limitations on aspects such as visual effects, costumes, makeup, and set design. These constraints may impact the overall aesthetic and appeal of the finished product. 3. Difficulty securing funding: Low-budget films often struggle to find financial backers or investors, as they may be considered too risky or uncertain in terms of profitability. This can lead to difficulties in getting projects off the ground or getting attention from potential supporters. 4. Limited distribution: Low-budget films may not have the marketing or distribution resources necessary to reach a wider audience. This can result in a reduced chance of commercial success and a smaller impact on the industry as a whole. 5. Sustainability: The financial uncertainty and limited resources of low-budget filmmaking can make it challenging for those involved to maintain a stable career, which may lead to burnout, high turnover, and a general lack of security for those in the industry. In summary, the phrase \\"of low-budget filmmaking\\" can be seen as both positive and negative. On the one hand, it represents an opportunity for increased creative freedom, accessibility, and innovation. On the other hand, it can be associated with challenges such as limited resources, lack of funding, and difficulties in achieving commercial success. The perception of low-budget filmmaking ultimately depends on the specific context and the individual's perspective."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"earth's tilt on it's rotating axis causes rapid what?\\" is \\"root growth\\", given that  earth's tilt on it's rotating axis causes rapid weather changes? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"Earth's tilt on its rotating axis causes rapid what?\\" is typically \\"seasonal changes\\" or \\"weather changes\\", not \\"root growth\\".  The Earth's tilt on its rotating axis does indeed have a substantial impact on our world, but its most direct effects relate to climate and seasons. This tilt – approximately 23.5 degrees – means that the Earth does not rotate upright but is instead slanted as it makes its journey around the sun. This tilt, alongside the elliptical shape of Earth's orbit, means that different parts of Earth receive different amounts of sunlight at different times of the year, leading to our seasonal changes. When the North Pole tilts towards the Sun, it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Half a year later, when the South Pole tilts towards the Sun, the situation is reversed. As for root growth, it's more directly affected by factors such as the quality of the soil, availability of water, temperature, and the presence of necessary nutrients rather than the Earth's axial tilt. Different plants have different requirements for root growth, and while the changing seasons (which again, are affected by Earth's tilt) might affect when a plant is best able to grow, it would be overly simplistic and not particularly accurate to say that Earth's tilt causes rapid root growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

POTTER'' is Jamaica Kincaid's new novel; Jamaica Kincaid's new novel is ''Mr. Potter.'' The sensation created by that sentence is one that may recur many times in the reader of ''Mr. Potter,'' a longing for things to be said only once -- and a longing for more to be said. Mr. Potter is a man without qualities, an illiterate taxi driver on Kincaid's native island of Antigua, whose life, though full of loss and suffering, is essentially uneventful. His illegitimate daughter, Elaine Cynthia, returns to the island after his death to write his story -- in fact, to narrate this novel. Her father may have created her, but he played no part in her upbringing and scarcely acknowledged her existence. Perhaps there is some element of revenge in her re-creation of him. The character she gives birth to is nearly as speechless as a newborn infant -- his favorite expression, ''Eh, eh,'' or, at times of strong emotion, ''Oooooohhhhh!'' There is little or no dialogue in most of Kincaid's books, but here it seems to matter more than usual, maybe because Mr. Potter is so very much under the thumb of his unforgiving narrator. The book is difficult to read, mostly because of its insistent repetition. In the opening paragraph of the novel, the phrase ''the sun was in its usual place, up above and in the middle of the sky'' occurs four times, with only the tiniest variations. No doubt this emphasizes the relentlessness of the Caribbean sun, and the repetitive sameness of Caribbean weather; but for the reader it is a significantly more difficult experience to cope with than a spell on a Caribbean island. It wouldn't be so hard if the repetition weren't coupled, here and everywhere it occurs, with a stern rebuff to any idea that it might be meaningful. So ''the sun was in its usual place, up above and in the middle of the sky, but Mr. Potter did not note this, so accustomed was he to this.'' He doesn't notice the sun, but nor does he notice anything else, for this is a man who ''said nothing to himself and sang nothing to himself and thought nothing to himself. . . . Nothing crossed his mind and the world was blank and the world remained blank.'' This is how the novel proceeds -- we are told something, then immediately cautioned against thinking that it might mean anything. Derek Walcott once spoke admiringly of the way that each of Kincaid's sentences ''heads toward its own contradiction.'' In ''Mr. Potter'' they tend toward contradictions so final that they could almost be crossings-out -- the delicate tension between possibility and impossibility has been lost. ''Mr. Potter'' is an essay in a peculiarly Antiguan -- or peculiarly Kincaidian-Antiguan -- state of mind, a state of mind that a single sentence in her excellent 1997 memoir, ''My Brother,'' sums up well: ''We ate the tamarinds; they were not good, they were not bad, they were just tamarinds.'' In other words, they were not literary tamarinds or metaphoric tamarinds or signifiers-of-economic-oppression tamarinds; they were just fruit. So with Mr. Potter. He eats, he sleeps, he fornicates (thus fathering numerous children, all of whom inherit his nose). He likes a clean shirt, a nice car, an open window. And that is all there is to him, at least in the eyes of his daughter-narrator; he is just a man, not good, not bad, but poor, illiterate and not very interesting. It is actually impossible for him to be interesting in any conventional literary way: he has barely been in love; he doesn't really dream; he has scarcely any feelings. For Mr. Potter there is none of the rich man's luxury of thinking and pondering: for him there is only poverty's deadening literalism. But because he hardly cares, he is hard for us to care about. He has none of the startling rage of the Caribbean heroine of Kincaid's 1996 novel, ''The Autobiography of My Mother,'' and none of the cocky disastrousness of Devon in ''My Brother.'' Elaine Cynthia's narration of her father's life is spare and unemotional, but she cannot resist the occasional display of penmanship. Mostly the prose shuns decoration, preferring to present the action in a deceptively plain fashion. The sentences are chains of ''And . . . and . . . and,'' strangely reminiscent of Hemingway, of all people: ''and he opened the door and he sat in the driver's seat and he turned the car's key so that the engine would start the car.'' As with Hemingway, this technique produces some lines that are arrestingly beautiful and some that are irritatingly bland. Elsewhere, though, the narrator stops telling and grows showy. Early in the novel, for example, she makes an impossibly arbitrary rule for herself: ''This sentence should begin with Dr. Weizenger emerging, getting off the launch . . . but this is Mr. Potter's life and so Dr. Weizenger must never begin a sentence.'' The sentence does, of course, begin with Dr. Weizenger anyway. And why not: a person's position in a sentence is dictated by grammar, not seniority. At any rate, the rule is abandoned a couple of paragraphs later, having done little but undermine its inventor. The daughter also inserts frequent notebooky parentheses into her story. ''The thick coating of asphalt no longer lay smooth like the icing on a cake (or something like that).'' ''The light just outside the window (or the windows, as it may be).'' They are perhaps intended to stress her fallibility, to remind us that the novel can only be her writerly guess at the outlines of her father's life. Unfortunately, the effect -- as with the ''Dr. Weizenger must never begin a sentence'' business -- is to remind us that she is not just writing but writing, an effect that further obscures the poor figure of Mr. Potter himself (who cannot, after all, write back). If it is true that between Mr. Potter and his surroundings there is ''no distance of any kind,'' between Mr. Potter and Elaine Cynthia Potter there is, if anything, too much distance. If her creation was accidental, sometimes his feels even more so. There are flashes of intuition and of tenderness, particularly in the portrait of Mr. Potter's father, a fisherman, or in the glimpse we catch of Mr. Potter's boyhood: in these moments, we are reminded of how wonderfully Kincaid can write when she takes off her Elaine Cynthia straitjacket. But mostly Mr. Potter is a man erased by his own biography. Somewhere in the process of becoming Mr. Potter, he disappeared. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"\\"Mr. Potter\\" is Jamaica Kincaid's novel that tells the story of an illiterate taxi driver in Antigua, narrated by his daughter, Elaine Cynthia.

They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches.  Who would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions, John or keith? Answer:","output":"In this scenario, John would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions, while Keith would rely on his hunches. The main reason for this difference in approach to decision-making lies in their respective strategies: optimal decision-making versus intuition. John's optimal decision-making process involves gathering information, evaluating options, and making choices based on rational analysis and quantifiable elements. One key component of optimal decision-making is assigning utility values (i.e., numerical values representing the worth, gain, or satisfaction) to the available options, allowing for an objective comparison and facilitating informed decision-making. In this case, given that John aims for an optimal decision-making process, he would most likely assign utility values to decisions A, B, and C. The certain outcomes of decision A and decision B would allow him to calculate their utility values directly and systematically. However, since decision C has an uncertain outcome, John would need to estimate the utility value based on the available information and his understanding of the likelihood of various possible outcomes. On the other hand, Keith relies on his intuition or hunches in making decisions. This approach is less dependent on empirical data, numerical values, or systematic evaluation of options. Instead, Keith might base his decisions on his feelings, past experiences, or other subjective factors that may not require or involve the assignment of utility values to the available options. In conclusion, considering their respective decision-making strategies, it is more likely that John would assign utility values to the various decisions, while Keith would not. By using utility values and an optimal decision-making process, John can better assess the potential outcomes and make informed choices, whereas Keith's reliance on intuition may provide him with quicker, but less systematically grounded, decisions. Although both strategies can be effective in certain situations, each individual's success in the decision-making game would depend on the accuracy of their approach in predicting the actual outcomes of the choices they make."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: A mother-of two shed an incredible four stone in just six months to look ship-shape for when her Navy commander husband came home. Determined Michelle Dalgleish, 31, from Plymouth, set herself a challenge of losing a few pounds while her other half was serving on the HMS Argyll. But when Lieutenant Commander Grant Dalgleish, 35, stepped ashore he barely recognised his wife because of her staggering weight loss. Scroll down for video. Michelle Dalgleish from Plymouth before the weight loss at 13st 13lbs (l) and after, at 9st 11lbs (r) She welcomed home her service husband Grant after losing more than 4st in weight. During Grant's six-month deployment in the Caribbean and North Atlantic, the full-time mother slimmed from a size 16 to a size 10 without telling him what she was doing. Shocked Grant stepped off the ship at Plymouth Docks on Thursday and saw his drastically slimmer wife for the first time. Michelle said: 'I was really nervous while I was waiting for him, but obviously really excited too. 'He had no idea what I had been up to, and he's always said he loved me no matter what my size was. 'I had a skirt on so he could see my legs, but when I took my coat off he was absolutely gobsmacked. 'He couldn't believe it. He kept looking at me and saying \\"I can't believe it, I can't believe it\\".' Michelle says she decided to do it because with two children she wanted to be healthy and have more energy. Proud Grant added: 'Our Facetime sessions were only with the kids so I never actually saw her while I was deployed. 'It explains a lot. I was absolutely shocked when I first saw her as I walked off the ship. 'I love my wife whatever size but to see her 4st lighter is quite remarkable. It's a remarkable achievement. I seriously had no idea.' Michelle put on weight while she was pregnant with Poppy, now 13 months, a sister to Harrison, four. She decided to slim down again just before Grant was deployed in June, and three days later joined Slimming World with a goal to lose two stone by Christmas. But after ditching the rounds of toast and fatty foods her weight dropped away, and she revised her goal to three stone - and then four stone. Over the six months she slimmed down from 13st 13lbs down to 9st 11lbs. 'I decided to do it because with two children I wanted to be healthy and have more energy,' Michelle said. 'When I was pregnant with Poppy my BMI wasn't great so my main aim was to get to a healthy BMI. 'After pregnancy you have to give yourself some time before you start trying to lose weight - your body needs to be ready for it after a baby. 'With Harrison I did it too early, but I knew I was practically going to be a single mum for six months while Grant was away so I needed to be fit. 'But I had a big motivation in not telling him and for it to be a surprise. Before I didn't want to buy clothes and didn't want to have pictures taken.

In 1860 , Bouch designed the first British standard gauge locomotives to use a 4 - 4 - 0 wheel layout which had earlier become popular in the United States .  - On a steam locomotive, a trailing wheel or trailing axle is generally an unpowered wheel or axle (wheelset) located behind the driving wheels. The axle of the trailing wheels is usually located in a trailing truck. On some large locomotives, a booster engine was mounted on the trailing truck to provide extra tractive effort when starting a heavy train and at low speeds on gradients.  - George Stephenson (9 June 1781  12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer who built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. Renowned as the \\"Father of Railways\\", the Victorians considered him a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement, with self-help advocate Samuel Smiles particularly praising his achievements. His rail gauge of , sometimes called \\"Stephenson gauge\\", is the standard gauge by name and by convention for most of the world's railways.  - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, two powered driving wheels on one axle and no trailing wheels. This type of locomotive is often called a Jervis type, the name of the original designer. Overview. The wheel arrangement type was common on United States railroads from the 1830s through the 1850s. The first to be built was the \\"Experiment\\", later named \\"Brother Jonathan\\", for the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad in 1832. It was built by the West Point Foundry based on a design by John B. Jervis. Having little else to reference, the manufacturers patterned the boiler and valve gear after locomotives built by Robert Stephenson of England. A few examples of Stephenson locomotives were already in operation in America, so engineers did not have to travel too far to get their initial ideas.  - Shildon is a town in County Durham, in England. The population taken at the 2011 Census was 9,976. It is situated south east of Bishop Auckland, north of Darlington, from Durham, from Sunderland and from Newcastle upon Tyne. Shildon is part of the Bishop Auckland parliamentary constituency, which has been represented since 2005 by Helen Goodman MP for the Labour Party.  - The Whyte notation for classifying steam locomotives by wheel arrangement was devised by Frederick Methvan Whyte, and came into use in the early twentieth century following a December 1900 editorial in \\"American Engineer and Railroad Journal\\". The notation counts the number of leading wheels, then the number of driving wheels, and finally the number of trailing wheels, groups of numbers being separated by dashes. Other classification schemes, like UIC classification and the French, Turkish and Swiss systems for steam locomotives, count axles rather than wheels.  - Middlesbrough is a large industrial town on the south bank of the River Tees in North East England, founded in 1830. The local council, a unitary authority, is Middlesbrough Borough Council. In 2011 it had a total resident population of 138,400 for the borough and 174,700 for the wider Middlesbrough built-up area subdivision, which itself is part of the larger built-up area of Teesside and had an overall population of 376,333 at the 2011 census.  - The standard gauge (also Stephenson gauge after George Stephenson, International gauge, or normal gauge) is a widely used railway track gauge. Approximately 55% of the lines in the world are this gauge. All high-speed rail lines (except those in Russia, Uzbekistan, and Finland) are standard gauge. The distance between the inside edges of the rails is defined to be (except in the United States, where it is still defined in Imperial and US customary units as ). It is also called the UIC gauge or UIC track gauge, the European gauge in the EU and Russia, or uniform gauge in Queensland, Australia.  - Stockton-on-Tees is a market town in the ceremonial county of County Durham, North East England. It is the major settlement in the borough of Stockton-on-Tees. The town sits within the Tees Valley region of the North East of England, and the wider borough had a population of 191,000 in 2011 estimates.  - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, four powered and coupled driving wheels on two axles and no trailing wheels. The wheel arrangement is known as a Porter.  - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, represents the arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, usually in a leading bogie, four powered and coupled driving wheels on two axles, and no trailing wheels. Almost every major railroad that operated in North America in the first half of the 19th century owned and operated locomotives of this type. Due to the large number of the type that were produced and used in the United States, the is most commonly known as the American type, but the type subsequently also became popular in the United Kingdom, where large numbers were produced. Overview. The first use of the name \\"American\\" to describe locomotives of this wheel arrangement was made by \\"Railroad Gazette\\" in April 1872. Prior to that, this wheel arrangement was known as a \\"standard\\" or \\"eight-wheeler\\". This locomotive type was so successful on railroads in the United States of America that many earlier 4-2-0 and 2-4-0 locomotives were rebuilt as 4-4-0s by the middle of the 19th century.  - The Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR) was a railway company that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863. The world's first public railway to use steam locomotives, its first line connected collieries near Shildon with Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington, and was officially opened on 27 September 1825. The movement of coal to ships rapidly became a lucrative business, and the line was soon extended to a new port and town at Middlesbrough. While coal waggons were hauled by steam locomotives from the start, passengers were carried in coaches drawn by horses until carriages hauled by steam locomotives were introduced in 1833.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What did the author say about the Australian sun? Options: - something about it causing injury - not enough information - something about it being mild to skin - something about it being harsh on the skin Answer:","output":"- something about it being harsh on the skin"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They'd told him that this is what they did for fun. Chloe assured him that they \\"lived for this kinda shit.\\" Ok, fine. He could sort of see that. Once he was there, helping them come up with the plan and then actually carrying it out, it sure as hell was exciting - probably the most exciting thing he'd ever done. Now that he was home and alone with his misgivings and paranoia, it all seemed like a really stupid idea. If it weren't for Chloe and her mesmerizing enthusiasm, there's no doubt that he wouldn't be doing this at all. But it was too late now. Or was it?

Turn your oven on to \\" bake \\" and set it to 400 degrees. As it is heating up, run through your ingredients to make sure you have everything you need.","output":"For this scrumptious twice-baked potato recipe, you will need 4 large russet potatoes, ½ cup sour cream, ½ cup milk, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper. You may also add optional garnishes such as chopped chives, cooked crumbled bacon, or chopped green onions. Once you have gathered your ingredients, start by washing the potatoes thoroughly and piercing them multiple times with a fork so that steam can escape during the cooking process. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper and bake for approximately one hour, or until they are fork-tender and cooked all the way through. When the potatoes are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes, just long enough so you can handle them without burning yourself. Carefully slice the top third off each potato, then use a spoon to scoop out the soft flesh, making sure to leave about ¼ inch of potato skin as a shell. Place the scooped-out potato flesh into a large mixing bowl. Now, add the sour cream, milk, butter, half of the shredded cheddar cheese, and salt and pepper to taste into the mixing bowl with the potato flesh. Using a hand mixer or a potato masher, blend these ingredients together until they are smooth and creamy. At this point, you can also mix in additional ingredients such as bacon pieces, sautéed onions, or chopped herbs if you desire. Next, spoon the creamy potato mixture back into the potato shells, filling them completely. Be gentle as you work, so the fragile shells don't break. Top each filled potato shell with the remaining shredded cheddar cheese. Adjust the oven temperature to 350 degrees, and bake the potatoes for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, allowing the cheese to melt and become bubbly. Once the cheese is melted and the potatoes are heated through, remove them from the oven and let them cool for just a minute or two. Finally, garnish your twice-baked potatoes with your choice of toppings, such as chopped chives or green onions, additional crumbled bacon, or a dollop of sour cream.

A one-armed criminal, a Boglodite named Boris the Animal, stages a jailbreak (along the way killing Obadiah Price, a fellow inmate he'd made a deal with). His intention is to rewrite history, with Agent K, the one who arrested and imprisoned him, being a major factor in his plan...On Earth, Agent K and his partner Agent J cover up an arrival of an alien spacecraft, and hear of the prison break. At a Chinese restaurant thats a local haunt for aliens, Agent K discovers Boris (who had previously gone to see Obadiah's son Jeffrey) and the two fight, with J joining in. K is upset that the alien he should have killed is out loose again; he deems it his own affair and forbids J to help him, suspending him. A puzzled J checks up on Boris: he appeared in 1969 to stop the prevention of the ArcNet Shield, a device that K deployed to protect the world from harm (but which killed off the Boglodites, as they can only survive by feeding off worlds). He managed to kill on 15 July 1969 an alien named Roman the Fabulous and on the following day... at this point O cuts him off and tells him not to investigate any further. That night, as K waits for Boris with a gun in his hand, he suddenly vanishes...The next morning, J discovers that he has a new partner, the liberated Agent AA, and that K has been dead for forty years (having been killed by Boris the Animal on 16th July 1969). O notices he is suffering from headaches and craves chocolate milk, which she explains are symptoms of time-fracture (aka the crime of interfering with history, which Obadiah Price was imprisoned for). At this point a Boglodite armada appears; J learns that there was nothing to hold them at bay, with no K to deploy the ArcNet. He theorizes that Boris went back in time to 1969 to kill K, thus changing history to what it was, and proposes to follow him; he heads to Jeffrey Price, who had provided Boris a time-jump device, and gets another one from him, and activates it by jumping off the Chrysler Building just as the Boglodites begin their assault...J arrives in 15 July 1969, with the intention to catch Boris as he is about to murder Roman the Fabulous. However, he is delayed from navigating the era of 1969 (most notably by an altercation with two racist cops), and gets there too late to stop Romans murder by 1969 Boris. He encounters 1969 Agent K, who subdues him and brings him to MiB headquarters. J tells K nothing, but when threatened with getting his memory erased he tells K part of the truth: he came from the future in pursuit of another time-traveler whos trying to change history.K and J follow a trail of clues to Andy Warhols Factory complex, where Warhol is revealed to be MiB Agent W. He notifies them of Griffin, an Arcanian being who has the ability to foresee all timelines and futures; Griffins planet was destroyed by the Boglodites, so he came to live on Earth and brought with him a device which will prevent the Boglodites from consuming the Earth. 1969 Boris arrives at the Factory in search of Griffin, who makes a quick exit with Boris in fast pursuit (to Js displeasure, although K doesnt seem to get too worried).J and K eventually track down Griffin at Shea Stadium, where he is foreseeing the future victory for the Mets baseball team. 1969 Boris appears and captures Griffin, but J and K are able to rescue Griffin, although Boris gets away.

UPDATED:. 05:36 EST, 7 May 2013. A new study has discovered that women’s brains are hard-wired to respond to a baby’s cry, while men do not seem to react at all. Research, carried out by National Institute of Child Health in the U.S., asked 18 men and women to let their minds wander. During this time the scientists conducted brain scans. Oblivious: Brain scans have shown that men's brains do not react in the same way as women to the sound of a distressed baby. The researchers then played a recording of white noise interspersed with short clips of a baby crying. The scans showed that while women immediately became more alert after hearing a baby’s cry, the brains of men remained in a resting state. Specifically, the dorsal medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate areas, known to be involved when the mind is allowed to wander, were recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and later studied for results. 'Determining whether these responses differ between men and women, by age, and by parental status, helps us understand instincts for caring for the very young,’ study co-author Marc Bornsteinfrom the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development told Medical Daily. Although brain activity patterns differed between men and women, there was no difference in the brain patterns between parents and non-parents. The researchers also played the cries of infants who were later diagnosed with autism. Interestingly, the study found that both men and women reacted to autistic babies. Previous studies have shown that babies with the condition have higher-pitched cries. Interestingly, hearing these cries interrupted the mind wandering of both men and women. A previous study has shown that the. screams of infants who develop autism tend to be higher pitched than. those of other babies and that the pauses between cries are shorter. It has been long known that women's bodies react to the sound of babies after pregnancy. Soon. after birth, a woman's 'letdown reflex' — the reflex that releases the. milk produced by breasts — needs time to adjust to the. sensation of feeding. Frequent. breastfeeding will help the reflex become attuned to particular. stimulation, but until then, many sensations such as hearing screams and. even certain thoughts may trigger lactation (the release of milk from the breast). Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

Write an article with the title: \\"Filibuster charade ends\\"","output":"Title: Filibuster Charade Ends Introduction: The notorious legislative tool, the filibuster, has long played a significant role in the dynamics of US politics. It might have become synonymous with wasted time, highlighting the inefficiency of politics, but its reign of power is finally over in America's political arena. The filibuster was once seen as a powerful tool to silence the minority, but in recent years, the misuse of its power has attracted heavy criticism. The charade is now drawing to a close, paving the way for true democracy and an effective legislative system. Historical Background: The filibuster, a term derived from a Spanish word meaning \\"pirate\\" or \\"freebooter\\", traces its roots back to ancient Rome, where it was a common practice to talk a proposal to death. The concept first entered American politics in the early 19th century and initially appeared without significant controversy. Senators were allowed to use the filibuster to extend the debate for as long-duration, often stopping important legislation from moving forward. The tactic has been employed by both Republicans and Democrats, a tool often used as a safeguard for minority interests. The Abuse of the Filibuster: The filibuster's initial aim was to provide a fair platform to minority groups, allowing them to voice their opinions and perspectives. With no specific rules pertaining to its use, though, it has been prone to exploitation and abuse. As party polarisation increased, the filibuster became an obstructionist weapon, derailing legislation and hampering progress. The lengthy speeches associated with the practice not only wasted precious time but also deflected attention from other significant issues. Senators could keep the floor indefinitely just to ensure their party's interests or block legislation they opposed, even if it would have had the majority support. An Era of Gridlock: Perhaps the most glaring drawback of the filibuster is the legislative gridlock that it has caused. Due to its prolonged and exploitative usage, it has resulted in producing sluggish governance by promoting an environment where only supermajorities could pass legislation. Consequently, a disenchanted electorate has grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress in addressing pressing social and economic issues. The End of the Filibuster Charade: In recent times, politicians and the public alike increasingly recognise the need for filibustering reform. Calls have intensified to end this practice which, despite its initially noble intentions, has proved an impediment to meaningful legislative activity. Proposals to reform the filibuster range from eliminating it altogether to implementing tight rules and regulations on its use, such as requiring the presence of a certain number of senators during the debate or allowing for a maximum time limit on speeches. The Path to Progress: The ending of the filibuster charade opens doors for democratic growth, ensuring that the legislative process is a true reflection of the people's voice. No longer stifled by a self-serving tactic, Congress can now focus on debating and passing legislation aimed at resolving the complex challenges faced by the nation. This marks a new era in American politics, one free from obstructions and devoted to focusing on collective wellbeing and the will of the majority. Conclusion: The end of the filibuster charade signals a shift towards a democratic process based on transparency, fairness, and efficiency. As lawmakers navigate the complexities of modern challenges, the absence of filibustering as a hampering factor will allow for more creative solutions and robust progress. The hope is that the elimination or reform of the filibuster will contribute to restoring the faith of the American people in their political institutions and pave the way for a more responsive and efficient government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN","output":"Part #1: Understand actions and their corresponding commands. Usage: 'I_LOOK' corresponds to the command 'look'. Here, the action 'I_LOOK' represents the agent looking at its environment, which is translated to the command 'look' in natural language. Part #2: Recognize direction-related words. Usage: In the command \\"turn left\\", the word 'left' denotes the direction of the action. In this case, 'left' indicates that the agent should turn left. Part #3: Understand 'opposite' and its meaning. Usage: Turning opposite right means the agent turns backward in the right direction. If the agent were to turn right at first, then the opposite of that action would be turning left. Part #4: Recognize the usage of 'around'. Usage: In the command \\"walk around left\\", it means the agent should execute the action 'walk' while turning around in the left direction. Part #5: Understand the usage of 'and'. Usage: In the command \\"run and jump\\", it signifies that the agent should first run, then execute a jump. Part #6: Recognize the meaning of 'after'. Usage: In the command \\"jump after run\\", it means the agent should execute a run following a jump. Part #7: Understand 'twice' and 'thrice' for repetitive actions. Usage: In the command \\"jump twice\\", it means the agent should execute the jump action two times. Given the input sequence of actions: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN The correct command in limited natural language form would be: \\"turn right and jump and turn left and run and turn left and run\\" This matches the sequence of actions when executed: 1. I_TURN_RIGHT: turn right 2. I_JUMP: jump 3. I_TURN_LEFT: turn left 4. I_RUN: run 5. I_TURN_LEFT: turn left 6. I_RUN: run"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.\\"?

Question: who finds the 2's corpse? Movie title: 9 Movie plot: 9 is a sentient rag doll who appears to be the scientist last creation and the last of his kind, living in the ruins of a decaying, post-apocalyptic Earth. He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse â a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback. In the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping. Almost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock. 9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back. The Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionetteÂ â the dummy created... A:","output":"In the movie \\"9\\", it is not explicitly mentioned who finds the 2's corpse, as the character's death mostly takes place off-screen. However, it is important to note that the main character, 9, witnesses 5's soul being sucked out by the Cat Beast, leaving 5 lifeless. As for 2, he is also killed by the Cat Beast, and it can be inferred that the other rag dolls eventually become aware of his demise since the Cat Beast wears the numbered skins of all its victims like a garment. So, while it's not explicitly stated, it's likely that the rag doll community would eventually discover 2's lifeless body in the aftermath of the Cat Beast's attacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was a member of the distinguished Caecilius Metellus family, which was part of the Roman nobility. Quintus earned the nickname \\"Creticus\\" after successfully leading a campaign on the island of Crete in 69 BC, where he defeated the pirate forces that had been using the island as their base. During his lifetime, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus held various positions within the Roman government. In 74 BC, he served as a praetor, a high-ranking judicial officer. Later, in 69 BC, he was appointed as a consul, which was the highest political office in the Roman Republic at the time, alongside his colleague Quintus Hortensius. The campaign on Crete solidified Metellus Creticus's reputation as an effective military commander. Although the island had a difficult terrain and a complex political landscape, Metellus managed to subdue the local population and defeated the pirates who had been plaguing the sea routes in the eastern Mediterranean. The victory not only boosted Metellus's prestige but also helped restore Roman control and order in the region. Metellus Creticus's accomplishments extended beyond his military successes. As one of the leading figures of Rome's ruling elite, he played a significant role in shaping the political landscape of the late Roman Republic. He formed alliances with other influential politicians, contributed to the stability of the government, and worked diligently to maintain the social and political standing of his family. Through his successful military career and influential political alliances, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus made a significant impact on the Roman Republic during his time. His contributions played an important part in Rome's expansion and consolidation of power in the ancient Mediterranean world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools.

In the RGB color model, each primary color (red, green, and blue) can be combined in various proportions to create different colors. In this case, green and blue light combine to create a color between them, which is cyan. Cyan is a secondary color in the RGB model and can be thought of as a hue that appears both greenish and bluish. The intensity and exact appearance of the cyan produced will depend on the proportion of green and blue light being mixed. By adjusting the amount of each primary color, you can achieve various shades of cyan, from a more greenish-cyan to a more bluish-cyan. In terms of digital color representation, such as when working with image editing software or coding, the combination of green and blue light is often represented in RGB values. For example, in an 8-bit representation (where each primary color can have a value from 0 to 255), a perfect cyan can be represented as (0, 255, 255), where red = 0, green = 255, and blue = 255.

Crate training will have many benefits for your bulldog, including protecting him from household hazards and reducing his separation anxiety. To begin crate training, you will need to select the right-sized crate for your bulldog. It should be either 24 x 30 inches (61 x 76 cm) or 24 x 36 inches (61 x 91 cm) for a French bulldog, and either 42 x 30 inches (107 x 76 cm) or 42 x 36 inches (107 x 91 cm) for an American bulldog.  Your bulldog should be able to sit, stand, and lie down easily in the crate, but not have enough space to create a bathroom area.  If you have a puppy, consider purchasing a crate with an adjustable divider. This will allow you to increase the crate space as your puppy grows into an adult. The crate should be a place of safety and comfort for your bulldog. The more welcoming it feels to him, the more likely he’ll want to spend time inside of it. Place his favorite blanket and toys in the crate. You can also place a quilt or sheet over the crate to make it feel like a cozy den. In addition, place his food and water bowls in the crate. Since bulldogs are motivated by food, place some food in your bulldog’s bowl or on the crate floor to encourage him to enter the crate. A bowl would preferable, since he wouldn't be able to pull it out of the crate very easily. Whenever he enters the crate, give him lots of verbal praise—this will teach him that going inside his crate is a good thing.  Leave the door open during the early stages of crate training so he can explore the crate at his leisure. Consider giving him a verbal command, such as ‘crate,’ to enter the crate. Immediately give him a treat and verbal praise when he enters the crate after your command. Once your bulldog is comfortable entering the crate on his own, work on closing its door behind him. Start with closing the door for only a few seconds and then letting him out. If he starts whining or crying, wait until he calms down before opening the door. When he can handle a few seconds, close the door, leave the room, and return after random lengths of time (e.g., 2 minutes, 5 minutes).  Opening the door only when he is calm will teach him not to use whining and crying to get your attention while he is in the crate. Remember that puppies cannot hold their bladders for very long, so you should not leave your puppy bulldog in the crate for long time periods. Until 12 months of age, puppies can hold their bladders for about 1 hour per month of age.  When you are home, spend time with your bulldog while he is in the crate. Bulldogs are friendly and sociable dogs; interacting with your bulldog will keep him from getting lonely. Always remember that the crate is a place of safety and comfort, not punishment. No matter how frustrated you get with your bulldog, especially if he has misbehaved, never send him to his crate to punish him. Your bulldog should always have a positive association with the crate.","output":"This article outlines the process of crate training for bulldogs, highlighting the importance of choosing the right-sized crate, creating a comfortable and welcoming environment, using positive reinforcement, and gradually building up to closing the crate door, while ensuring the crate remains a safe, positive space for the dog."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Yes or no? Answer: Fossils of cnidarians that do not build mineralized structures are very rare. Question: what is phylum cnidaria Answer:","output":"Phylum Cnidaria is a group of aquatic, primarily marine, invertebrate animals that encompasses over 10,000 species. They are known for their unique stinging cells called cnidocytes or nematocysts, which they use for capturing prey and defense. Cnidarians include diverse and ecologically significant organisms such as jellyfish, sea anemones, coral, and hydra. Cnidarians have a simple body plan with radial or biradial symmetry and comprise two main body forms: the polyp (a sessile, anemone-like form) and the medusa (a free-swimming, bell-shaped form). Some cnidarians can exist solely in one body form, while others, like many jellyfish, alternate between both forms throughout their life cycle. Phylum Cnidaria is divided into four main classes: 1. Class Hydrozoa: This class includes organisms like the freshwater hydra, colonial siphonophores, and marine fire corals. They display both polyp and medusa stages in their life cycle, but the polyp stage is more dominant. 2. Class Scyphozoa: Commonly known as true jellyfish, this class consists primarily of marine species. They are characterized by their dominant medusa stage and a reduced or absent polyp stage. 3. Class Cubozoa: Also known as box jellyfish, the members of this class have a box-shaped medusa and a complex visual system with multiple eye structures. Some species of box jellyfish are highly venomous and can pose a threat to humans. 4. Class Anthozoa: This class contains exclusively polyp forms, including sea anemones, sea pens, and both soft and stony corals. These organisms play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, particularly reef-building stony corals. Regarding the statement about fossils of cnidarians that do not build mineralized structures being very rare, it is accurate. Fossilization typically favors organisms with hard, mineralized parts like shells, bones, or exoskeletons. Since many cnidarians lack such structures, their fossils are often scarce in the geological record. Nonetheless, some remarkable cnidarian fossils have been found within exceptional preservation deposits (like the Burgess Shale) or as trace fossils left by their activities rather than their physical bodies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the topic that this about: A surprisingly large number of Americans took advantage of low mortgage rates to buy new homes in September, signaling continued strength in the real estate market.  (a). World (b). Sports (c). Business (d). Science/Tech","output":"(c). Business The statement provided is related to the real estate market and mortgage rates, which fall under the realm of business and finance. A detailed analysis of the topic is provided below. Low mortgage rates have been one of the most significant factors driving the increased demand for home purchases in the United States during September. This has resulted in a strong real estate market even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, showcasing the resilience of this particular sector. In this context, we will explore the reasons behind these low mortgage rates, their impact on buyers and the real estate market, as well as the possible long-term consequences of this phenomenon. Factors leading to low mortgage rates: 1. Central Bank Policies: The Federal Reserve has taken several measures to keep interest rates low during the current economic crisis. These measures are aimed at stimulating economic growth by making borrowing more accessible to businesses and individuals. As a result, mortgage rates have also dropped, and families have seized this opportunity to secure new homes at a lower cost. 2. Economic Uncertainty: The global pandemic has considerably affected employment and income levels, rendering the future economic prospects uncertain. Consequently, investors tend to opt for safer assets such as bonds, driving their prices up and their yields (interest rates) down. Lower bond yields, in turn, contribute to lower mortgage rates. Impact on homebuyers: Low mortgage rates have made homeownership more attainable for many Americans by reducing the monthly mortgage payments that come with purchasing a home. As a result of the reduced costs of borrowing, homebuyers have become more confident about investing in the housing market despite the ongoing uncertainties related to the pandemic. Impact on the real estate market: The higher demand for homes has led to an increase in property prices in many parts of the United States. Reduced inventory in some areas has escalated this situation, causing bidding wars among prospective buyers, ultimately benefiting the sellers. The competitive market has also spurred growth for builders and construction companies, contributing to the overall strength of the real estate market. Possible long-term consequences: 1. Recovery: A robust real estate market can help drive economic recovery by contributing to overall GDP growth and creating jobs in the construction and home improvement sectors. 2. Household Debt: Borrowing under favorable rates may lead to households taking on more debt than they can realistically manage. This could result in a surge in mortgage defaults in case of future rate hikes or a deteriorating economic climate. 3. Housing Bubble: A rapid increase in housing prices fueled by low mortgage rates and speculative behavior may risk creating a housing bubble, which could eventually lead to a sharp decline in home prices and negatively impact both homeowners and the broader economy. In conclusion, low mortgage rates have had a significant impact on the American real estate market during September by stimulating home purchases. While this has led to a robust housing market and appears to be contributing to economic recovery, it is essential to remain cautious of the potential long-term consequences, especially in terms of household debt and the possibility of a housing bubble."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It says 80% of parents are concerned about kids meeting bad people online. That's because young people who largely have grown up with the Net think of it as a social outlet , say the researchers.

Given the following context:  Alan Dudley Bush (22 December 1900 – 31 October 1995) was a British composer, pianist, conductor, teacher and political activist. A committed communist, his uncompromising political beliefs were often reflected in his music. He composed prolifically across a range of genres, but struggled through his lifetime for recognition from the British musical establishment, which largely ignored his works. Bush, from a prosperous middle-class background, enjoyed considerable success as a student at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in the early 1920s, and spent much of that decade furthering his compositional and piano-playing skills under distinguished tutors. A two-year period in Berlin in 1929 to 1931, early in the Nazi Party's rise to power, cemented Bush's political convictions and moved him from the mainstream Labour Party to the Communist Party of Great Britain which he joined in 1935. He wrote several large-scale works in the 1930s, and was heavily involved with workers' choirs for whom he composed pageants, choruses and songs. His pro-Soviet stance led to a temporary ban on his music by the BBC in the early years of the Second World War, and his refusal to modify his position in the postwar Cold War era led to a more prolonged semi-ostracism of his music. As  a result, the four major operas he wrote between 1950 and 1970 were all premiered in East Germany. In his prewar works, Bush's style retained what commentators have described as an essential Englishness, but was also influenced by the avant-garde European idioms of the inter-war years.

Does it follow that \\"The SCR and the FGD systems are completable within the same time frame.\\"?","output":"To determine if the statement \\"The SCR and the FGD systems are completable within the same time frame\\" follows from the given information, let's break down the information provided step-by-step: 1. The tie-in of the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) and the FGD (Flue Gas Desulfurization) systems could be done in the same outage. This means that the connection or integration of both systems can occur during the same period when the systems are not operating. 2. It has been confirmed that the installation of SCR and scrubber (which is part of the FGD system) could be performed simultaneously without interference. This suggests that both systems can be worked on at the same time without negatively affecting one another. Based on this information, we can conclude the following: While it does not explicitly state that both systems can be completed within the same time frame, the fact that they can be installed simultaneously and connected during the same outage implies that their completion could potentially occur within the same time frame.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Delaware rest stop deal a boon for HMSHost, but it raises questions about federal law Travelers may not know the name, but they have likely experienced the services of HMSHost. The Bethesda-based company provides dining and retail offerings at 110 airports internationally and 86 highway rest stops throughout the United States, including some in the Washington region. A trip along Interstate 95 passes several HMSHost travel plazas, including the company's newest, the renovated Delaware Welcome Center Travel Plaza slated to formally open Monday (June 28). . An expansive glass and steel structure, the 42,000-square-foot plaza is the latest example of a move by governments to turn over such pit stops to concessionaires -- despite concerns from small-business owners who complain that it can be hard to compete against big corporations handed prime locations. The Delaware center, located near Wilmington along I-95, underwent 10 months of redevelopment by HMSHost. The company, which has managed the site since it opened in 1964, won the bid to construct the new 35 million facility, partly financed by the firm's fuel partner, Sunoco. Travelers can expect some of the usual rest stop fare, such as Burger King and Cinnabon, along with a French bakery, Brioche Doree, and Mexican cuisine at Baja Fresh. The Delaware Department of Transportation will retain ownership of the land, while leasing the plaza to HMSHost for the next 35 years. The company will pay the agency 3 cents to 8 cents for every gallon of gas it sells and 5 percent to 8 percent of its gross sales of most other items. During construction, the state received 170,000 per month in rent from the operator. \\"The nature of a lot of these agreements isn't entirely new,\\" said Elie W. Maalouf, president and chief executive of HMSHost. \\"We have been building, operating and paying states a share of the revenue on projects like this for quite some time.\\" Indeed, HMSHost has been partnering with states on rest stop deals since the 1940s. As the operator of these sites, HMSHost secures franchise licensing agreements with brands such as Starbucks, paying a set fee. HMSHost employees then run the stores. The renewed interest in these public-private partnerships stems from the current stress on transportation funds as well as municipal finances. \\"This is one less expense that we have to manage,\\" said Michael Williams, a spokesman for the Delaware Department of Transportation. \\"We wanted to renovate the site once the lease was up, and we did so without having to spend a dime.\\" A growing number of states, including Vermont, Louisiana and New Hampshire, have closed or announced plans to close rest areas to save money in the past two years. Last August, Virginia, to shed 9 million in annual expenses, shuttered 19 of its 42 rest stops, though all have since been reopened. For these states, privatization simply wasn't an option. A 1958 federal law, aimed at protecting businesses located off highway exits, banned rest areas from offering commercial services along the interstate. Toll roads and privately run stops that existed before 1960, however, were exempted to the benefit of a handful of states, including Delaware and Maryland. \\"It's a silly law,\\" said Ronald D. Utt, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in D.C. \\"It's counterproductive and largely protective of national companies at the expense of the state, highways and motorists.\\" The McDonald's and Burger Kings of the world have replaced the mom-and-pop businesses Congress set out to protect, Utt argued. As evidence, he pointed to the lobbying efforts of the fast-food industry to defeat a bill introduced by Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) last year to repeal the prohibition. \\"You were not seeing the National Federation of Independent Business up there, you were seeing McDonald's,\\" Utt said. The legislation, a stopgap measure to save Virginia's rest stops, was voted down. But similar efforts have sprung up in Arizona and Oregon. The National Association of Truck Stop Operators has fought to keep the current rules in place. It maintains that commercial plazas squeeze out small, locally owned businesses. The Alexandria-based organization conducted a 2003 study with the University of Maryland that found 50 percent fewer businesses along roads with commercial rest stops. \\"Is this really what we want states to be doing? Competing with the private sector?\\" questioned Lisa J. Mullings, president and chief executive of NATSO. Mullings noted that many of her members are bracing themselves for the potential impact from the reopening of the Delaware center. \\"They said the new facility is going to attract far more visitors than the old one, about 4.5 million annually. That's about 10 times what one of our members would see,\\" she said. While the center was closed for construction, some of NATSO's members on I-95 had an increase in sales, in some cases by as much as 32 percent. But Williams argues that there are no rest stops for at least 25 miles in either direction of the center -- likely a function of the plaza's dominance. \\"Travelers need somewhere convenient to stop, somewhere they are familiar with,\\" he said. \\"This is a benefit to travelers as well as the state.\\" Williams noted that his agency is guaranteed to receive at least 1.6 million from the plaza annually, a boon for Delaware's transportation fund. Prior to the closure of the center, the fund took in 2.4 million in revenue from the service plaza in 2008. The windfall for states with commercial plazas perhaps presents the strongest argument for the repeal of the federal law, say proponents. Utt pointed to Pennsylvania, where fuel sales alone from travel plazas earned the state some 60 million in 2008. HMSHost is in the process of renovating a number of stops along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The company has also submitted a bid for the renovation of Maryland House and the Chesapeake House Welcome Center, sites it currently manages. \\"Millions of people have been stopping at these sites for generations,\\" Maalouf said. \\"It's already a part of people's planned journey; we are just making it better.\\"","output":"The renovated Delaware Welcome Center Travel Plaza, managed by HMSHost, is set to open amidst concerns about small-businesses competing against corporations. HMSHost, which provides dining and retail services at airports and highway rest stops, will lease the plaza from the Delaware Department of Transportation for 35 years. However, the 1958 federal law bans rest areas from offering commercial services along the interstate, raising questions about the legality of such partnerships. Critics argue that the law is counterproductive, as large chains have replaced small businesses."},{"instruction":"Select from: (I). No. (II). Yes.

Two men rappel down to retrieve the fallen hound, but they are killed. The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate where he finds his teammates dead and is killed by an unseen creature. Dr. Robert Verne (Robert Foxworth) is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements, where he feels he isn't making a difference.

The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \\"Opies\\" (i.e., \\"O.P.s\\"), the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie (Talia Shire) accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant, but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he against having children. When flying in, they meet Travis Nelson (Burke Byrnes) and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet paper mill director Bethel Isely (Richard A. Dysart), who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at Opies. The latter have their own explanation; Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers, which Isely describes as \\"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies who refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks (Armand Assante) and Kelso (Everett Creach), one of Isely's heavies.

But the total death number can be reduced when people take shelter in underground storm bunkers and hardened safe rooms. The tornado that carved a path of destruction through Moore took 24 lives. Its winds were clocked at 400 kilometers per hour. With only 15 minutes' warning, residents fled town or took refuge in the firmest corners of their homes. The luckiest were able to climb into shelters or move to safe rooms.  In Moore those rooms saved lives. But at two schools destroyed by Monday's tornado, no such shelter was available. Leslie Chapman Henderson is CEO of a non-profit group called the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. She's an advocate for tornado safe rooms.   \\"The safe room is an interior room of the home that has been reinforced and tested to withstand high wind. In fact, we've already heard of stories of survival of people who were in safe rooms, either above or below ground,\\" she said.  Better storm forecasts give people more time to react. But they need someplace safe to go. Buildings can be built to resist strong winds, but not like those in the F-5 tornado that touched down in Moore. Chapman Henderson says even the building codes that do exist are not widely adopted or enforced.  As its residents prepare to rebuild, Moore's mayor is pushing for an order to make safe rooms compulsory in all new construction. Similar proposals were made following each of the previous tornado strikes, but none were adopted. Options: A Building codes make a difference in preventing property destruction.

The Apollo 17 crew consisted of Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and Harrison Schmitt. The mission took place from December 7 to December 19, 1972. Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt became the eleventh and twelfth humans to set foot on the lunar surface.  Apollo 17 was launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the crew members journeyed to the Moon aboard the Command/Service Module (CSM) America and the Lunar Module (LM) Challenger. The Lunar Module touched down on the Moon's surface at the Taurus-Littrow landing site, a valley marked by various geological features and located near the southeastern edge of Mare Serenitatis, on December 11, 1972. Cernan and Schmitt spent around 75 hours on the lunar surface, conducting three moonwalks called Extravehicular Activities (EVAs), which lasted a total of about 22 hours. Their primary mission objectives included landing in a geologically diverse area and conducting surface experiments to study the Moon's structure, atmosphere, and environment. They deployed a variety of scientific instruments, known collectively as the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP), which allowed data collection and transmission back to Earth even after the astronauts' return. They also collected samples of lunar rocks, soil, and core material, adding to the wealth of lunar samples brought back by the earlier Apollo missions. In total, Apollo 17 returned with around 110.5 kilograms (243 pounds) of lunar materials. Apollo 17 marked the end of an era, as it was the final Apollo lunar landing mission and the last time humans set foot on the Moon. However, the legacy of the Apollo program has laid the groundwork for future human missions to the Moon and beyond. Over the decades since then, scientists have continued to analyze the data and samples gathered by Apollo astronauts, yielding invaluable insights into the Moon's composition, geology, and history.  Today, there are plans to return humans to the Moon under NASA's Artemis program, which aims to build a sustainable and long-term lunar presence and use it as a stepping stone for future missions to Mars and other destinations in the solar system. The first human Artemis mission, Artemis III, which is scheduled for the mid-2020s, will finally break the more than 50-year absence of humans on the Moon's surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How many days do the students have to kill each other? Movie title: Battle Royale Movie plot: The story opens with a frantic news broadcast about a young girl being brought back to mainland Japan after she wins the latest \\"Battle Royale\\", a contest that pits high school students against each other in a fight to the death on a remote island. While being filmed, the girl smiles.Shuya Nanahara, a Japanese middle school student, attempts to cope with life after his father's suicide by hanging. Meanwhile, schoolmate Noriko Nakagawa is the only student attending class -- 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, quietly leaves upon her tardy, apologetic arrival, but is attacked by student Yoshitoki Kuninobu and resigns after recovering from his wound.One year later, class 3-B takes a field trip after completing their compulsory studies; however, the class is gassed on their bus. They wake up in a \\"briefing room\\" on a remote island, wearing strange electronic collars. Kitano explains that the class has been chosen to participate in this year's Battle Royale as a result of the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school. The orientation video cheerfully instructs the class to kill each other for three days until only one student remains. Students resistant to their rules or entering one of the randomly placed \\"death zones\\" for each day are to be killed by the collar's detonation. One of the 42 students, Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, interferes with the video by whispering to her friends; Kitano kills her on the spot with a thrown knife. While a shocked class is subdued by soldiers, Kuninobu openly confronts the viciousness of Kitano and the teacher slashes him with a knife (in the back of leg - the same area Kuninobu attacked Kitano two years earlier) before detonating his collar while Shuya, his best friend, watches in horror. Each student is provided a bag of food and water, map of the island, compass, and one item containing either a lethal weapon (firearm, kama (sickle), knife, potassium cyanide) or an item apparently worthless toward survival (paper fan, binoculars, coat hanger, saucepan lid).

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn. In the winter I can’t ride, swim, garden, or mow, and I hate exercise I don’t enjoy. Anyway the long answer to the defining moment but there it is just the same.

Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him.

He only had two meat sandwiches to keep him going, as crocodiles moved beneath his tree each night until his rescue. Gatty said he decided it was safer to hold out for a rescue team than try to make a run for it. His problems began after he fell off his horse while out in the northern Australia outback. Dazed and bleeding, he climbed back on his horse and hoped it would lead him home. It was only when he regained his senses he realized that he had been taken into crocodile-infested area. \\"I had to get off the horse and I fell straight into a crocodile nest,\\" he told reporters. \\"That frightened me. I couldn't go back, it was too far and too dangerous, so I headed to the nearest high ground and stayed there, hoping someone would come and find me before the crocs did.\\" Gatty explained how each night two crocodiles would sit at the bottom of the tree staring at him. Although Gatty's two sandwiches ran out after three days, he was able to get running water during the day and knew rescuers were looking for him as he could see helicopters in the air above his tree. \\"If I hadn't seen the crocs circling me, and if I hadn't fallen into the croc nest, I would have made a push for it.
