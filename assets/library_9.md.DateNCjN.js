In the statement, \\"A little girl is taking the sheep for a walk,\\" it can be inferred that the girl is indeed holding a rope or some other means to control and guide the sheep as they walk, similar to walking a dog. However, several key elements are missing to conclusively link this to the premise given: 1. Crowd of people: The statement does not mention a crowd of people, only a girl walking the sheep. They might be walking in an isolated area or a populated area, but we cannot determine that from the information provided.    2. Holding a rope: Although it's likely that the girl may be using a rope to walk the sheep, the statement does not explicitly mention it. It could be a leash, a rope, or even a harness of some sort. Although not using a rope is less common, we cannot rule out that possibility. 3. Affirmation of the premise: The statement given describes a similar scenario to the premise, but it does not directly affirm that the premise is true. For example, if the statement said, \\"A little girl is taking the sheep for a walk through a crowd of people holding a rope attached to the animal,\\" we could then determine that both situations are describing the same event.

The six sacks increased the Bears season sack total to 14, which led the league, and is the most they have recorded in the first three games since 1987.

With running back Matt Forte out for the game, the Bears rushing attack ran for 103 yards and Michael Bush ran for a 3-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein kicked a 56-yard field goal, the longest in Soldier Field history.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is an increase in appetite happens, how will it affect MORE regulation of blood sugar level being needed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of an increase in appetite can have an effect on the regulation of blood sugar levels. An increased appetite might lead to an increased intake of food, particularly carbohydrates, which will cause blood sugar levels to rise more frequently after meals. As a result, the pancreas will need to release more insulin to help the body absorb and manage the increased levels of glucose in the blood. This could potentially strain the pancreas and insulin production, and if the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to process the increased blood sugar levels, it could result in persistent high blood sugar. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and potentially the development of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, an increased appetite may lead to more frequent snacking or larger meals, which may result in blood sugar levels fluctuating more dramatically. This could require more frequent release of glucagon in response to low blood sugar levels. The constant fluctuation can put additional pressure on the body's regulatory system to maintain normal blood sugar levels. In summary, an increased appetite can lead to a greater need for blood sugar level regulation, as it may result in more significant fluctuations in blood sugar. This has a direct effect on the process, with the pancreas needing to work harder to produce insulin and glucagon in response to the changes in blood sugar levels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In Triplicane the next morning, Rajan (Sivaji Ganesan), a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found murdered with his own hand gun. His neighbor Chinnaiah Pillai (P. D. Sambandam) hears the gunshot and complains to the police. A local Police Inspector named Purushothaman Naidu arrives and investigates the scene. He is joined by C.I.D. officer Sivanandam (Javar Seetharaman)there. He concludes that the killer is some petty thief who must have shot Rajan for the lump of money found in the same room of the crime scene. However, Sivanandam states that to be of a bad solution, as the amount of money matches exactly with the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room, without a single rupee's difference. Nonetheless, it was clear Rajan was making plans to leave Chennai, in anticipation of the bombings. Rajan's wife Usha (Pandari Bai) is almost dumbstruck and unable to speak during any inquiries. Sivanandam and Naidu feel reluctant and embarrassed to do any questioning to her.The two decide to investigate the case by questioning the people in and around the house, who are the family members or friends of Rajan. They first do their inquiry with Chinnaiah Pillai, the neighbour as he is the first to inform them. He tells that the killer could probably be Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother (T. K. Balachandran). He recounts an incident (as flashback), in which Pattabi confronts Rajan at the house's garage to ask for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him. Rajan, in good faith, denies to give Pattabi his share, feeling that he and his wife might squander it. Chinnaiah concludes that this would have kindled Pattabi to kill Rajan.Sivanandam and Naidu decide to inquire Pattabi.

Article: Sales of electric bicycles, or e-bikes, a hot item in consumer green tech, are expected to grow by more than 50% in North America during 2013. Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife.  I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as  traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description. Question: According to the text,e--bikes are practical for  _  . Answer: Choose from: 1). serious road cyclers; 2). couples spending a holiday; 3). people commuting to work; 4). professional mountain bikers; Answer:","output":"According to the text, e-bikes are practical for people commuting to work. The article suggests that e-bikes are popular among those looking for an environmentally-friendly way to get to their workplaces, especially given the challenges of using traditional bicycles such as having to deal with sweat and the need for office-appropriate clothing. Also, e-bikes are a cost-efficient option with rising gas prices, making them an attractive mode of transportation for work-related commutes. Furthermore, they provide the added benefit of not fitting the motorized vehicle description according to U.S. federal laws. This means users can enjoy the convenience and speed of an e-bike without entailing additional costs and regulations associated with motor vehicles. The audience for e-bikes, however, is not limited to work commuters. The article also highlights that casual cyclers who enjoy an occasional help with hills and wind, or those who want to save money on buying a motorbike, can also find e-bikes useful. Despite their rising popularity and accessibility, the text clearly mentions that these e-bikes are not aimed at serious road cyclers or professional mountain bikers, thus eliminating options 1 and 4 from the given choices. In conclusion, among the options provided, the article strongly supports that e-bikes are a practical solution for people commuting to work. Although the article does not explicitly mention couples spending a holiday (Option 2), it does not refute that e-bikes could also be useful for leisure or recreational activities. However, based on the given choices and the specific context provided in the article, the most accurate answer is people commuting to work (Option 3)."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

News article: UN Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, Staffan de Mistura , informs the media at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, Monday, March 14, 2016. Mistura... (Associated Press)      GENEVA (AP) — The Latest on Syrian peace talks that resumed in Geneva on Monday (all times local):      6:45 p.m.      Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the start of the pullout of the Russian military from Syria starting Tuesday.      Putin said the move should help serve as a stimulus for Syria's political talks. The president said he coordinated the move with Syrian President Bashar Assad.      Putin said that the Russian airbase in Hemeimeem in Syria's coastal province of Latakia and a naval facility in the Syrian port of Tartous will continue to operate.      6:40 p.m.      Russia says it has voiced concern about cease-fire violations by U.S.-backed rebels in Syria.      The Defense Ministry said Monday that the Russian military coordination center in Syria had a conference call with its U.S. counterpart in Amman about violations of the Russian and U.S. brokered truce by opposition units near Kafr Nabudah in Hama province.      It says militants in the area have been listed by the U.S. as abiding by the cease-fire.      The cease-fire that began on Feb. 27 has largely held, but both Syrian President Bashar Assad's government and its foes have accused one another of violations.      The Islamic State group and al-Qaida's branch in Syria, the Nusra Front, are excluded from the cease-fire, which is intended to bolster indirect Syrian peace talks that began Monday.      ___      5:30 p.m.      Residents say protesters have set fire to the security compound of an al-Qaida-linked group in northern Syria a day after the extremists swept through the town detaining U.S.-backed rebels.      An activist based in the northern town of Maaret al-Numan says the situation on Monday is \\"tense and boiling.\\" He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by the extremist group.      In recent days the al-Qaida-affiliated Nusra Front has raided the bases of the Free Syrian Army's Division 13 and stolen weapons and vehicles acquired with U.S. support.      Division 13 enjoys widespread support in Maaret al-Numan.      ___      5 p.m.      U.N. agencies and key partners say they are starting to get basic supplies to besieged areas in Syria but haven't reached about 20 percent of those in urgent need and are \\"extremely concerned\\" about some 500,000 people.      They said in a joint statement Monday that since the beginning of the year the U.N. and its partners have reached over six million people with aid through regular deliveries and recent convoys to besieged towns.      But U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien and 10 other signatories said not enough aid is getting through and medical supplies and equipment are still being removed at checkpoints, which is \\"unacceptable.\\"      ___      3:30 p.m.      The head of the Syrian government delegation to the indirect peace talks in Geneva says his side's discussions with U.N. special envoy for Syria were \\"positive and constructive.\\"      Bashar Ja'afari told reporters after the meeting with Staffan de Mistura as the talks resumed on Monday in Switzerland that the government delegation \\"submitted ideas and views\\" for a political solution to the crisis.      He says de Mistura will meet the representatives of the opposition on Tuesday and the government team again on Wednesday.      Ja'afari says his team wants \\"to negotiate as Syrians under Syrian leadership without foreign intervention and without preconditions.\\"      He says any party that opposes this premise is \\"trying to sabotage this round.\\" He was referring to the oppositions demands from the previous round that failed in early February, demands that had included an end to bombardment, release of detainees and the lifting of the siege by government troops on rebel-held areas across Syria.      ____      12:15 p.m.      Russia's Foreign Minister says federalization is one possible option in Syria if it is the will of the Syrian people.      Sergey Lavrov said Monday that Russia will support whatever solution the Syrian government and the opposition devise to end the country's war, including \\"any form (of government) whatever it may be called: federalization, decentralization, unitary state.\\"      Speaking after a joint briefing on Monday in Moscow with his Tunisian counterpart, Lavrov also said countries should not launch attacks against terrorists in Libya without first receiving permission from the U.N. Security Council.      Lavrov said discussions about equipping Tunisian special forces in their fight against terrorism are ongoing.      ___      11:15 a.m.      The U.N. special envoy for Syria says a resumption of peace talks between government envoys and representatives of the opposition is a \\"moment of truth\\" and insists the \\"only Plan B available is return to war.\\"      Staffan de Mistura spoke to reporters Monday moments before resuming \\"proximity talks\\" in Geneva, a month after suspending them in an upsurge in violence in Syria. The talks come as he said a \\"fragile\\" cease-fire has largely held since Feb. 27, and humanitarian aid deliveries have resumed in recent weeks.      Many observers say the peace talks are the best chance in years to end a war moving into its sixth year, leaving at least 250,000 people dead and forcing at least 11 million people to leave their homes — many abroad. ||||| Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu to start the withdrawal of forces from Syria starting Tuesday.

Next question: who has won the most oscars for costume design?","output":"The person who has won the most Oscars for costume design is Edith Head, an American costume designer who had a prolific career in Hollywood spanning over five decades. Born on October 28, 1897, in San Bernardino, California, Edith Head's contribution to the film industry earned her significant recognition and accolades. Head has won a total of 8 Academy Awards for Best Costume Design, making her the record holder in this category. She has been nominated a total of 35 times, which is an outstanding achievement in itself. Her career began in 1924 when she started working in the costume department at Paramount Pictures, where she was eventually promoted to head designer in 1938. The list of the films for which Edith Head won the Academy Awards for Best Costume Design is as follows: 1. The Heiress (1949): This black-and-white film directed by William Wyler showcases exceptional costume design, earning Head her very first Oscar. 2. Samson and Delilah (1950): A biblical epic directed by Cecil B. DeMille, this movie was a major success and garnered Edith Head her second Academy Award for costume design. 3. All About Eve (1950): Head shared this award for costume design for black-and-white films with Charles LeMaire. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the film is based on the life of an aspiring actress played by Anne Baxter. 4. A Place in the Sun (1951): This George Stevens-directed drama film featured dazzling costume design which led to Head's fourth win in the category. 5. Roman Holiday (1953): This charming romantic comedy, directed by William Wyler and starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, is yet another film that features Head's impressive costume design, earning her a fifth Oscar. 6. Sabrina (1954): This romantic comedy-drama film, directed by Billy Wilder and starring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, showcases Head's impeccable talent for which she received her sixth Academy Award for costume design. 7. The Facts of Life (1960): Head received her seventh Oscar for this comedy-drama film, which marked her first win in the costume design category for color films. 8. The Sting (1973): Edith Head's eighth and final Academy Award for costume design came with George Roy Hill's crime-drama film, starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Edith Head's outstanding career solidified her status as a Hollywood legend, and her costume design style became synonymous with the glamorous look of Hollywood's Golden Age. She continued working up until her death on October 24, 1981, leaving behind a spectacular legacy that remains unparalleled in the world of costume design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:They were in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. All around them, reminders of historic innovations that began with research at this legendary college. As the photographer clicked away, I wondered - what place in history would this photograph have? Will we look back at these 30 smiles and say, \\"That was the team that changed the world!\\"? If that is to be the case, there is a long road ahead. And indeed, it is long roads that are the motivation for this project. The MIT team is one of several working on Hyperloop, a vision for rapid travel put forth by Silicon Valley's most interesting man, Elon Musk. He says the commute from San Francisco to Los Angeles - currently a five-hour drive or an hour of flying - could be cut to 30 minutes. Hyperloop is a conceptual transport system in which passengers are loaded into pods and fired through vacuum tubes at more than 600mph (1,000km/h). Prototype pods have been tested running along magnetic tracks, much like the maglev trains used in countries such as Japan today. Pumping the air out of the tubes reduces resistance, allowing high speeds to be achieved, potentially using less energy than a train. The idea could reduce journey times over long distances, but there are many challenges for the rival developers to overcome before any such project can become a reality. Mr Musk is the boss of Tesla and founder of SpaceX, and when he published in 2013 a white paper outlining a way to use airtight tubes to propel pods at speeds of up to 700mph (1130km/h), he set a challenge to anyone and everyone who wanted to try and build the technology. Mr Musk isn't paying the firms, but he has committed to funding a series of tests. The hope is that these will happen in August this year. The target is that by 2021 humans will be travelling on Hyperloops around the world. The MIT team is one of more than 20 non-commercial groups also designing a Hyperloop pod - with money coming from SpaceX in the form of a competition. That was split over two phases - a design contest, which MIT won in January, and an on-track test coming up in the summer. But it all could be a colossal waste of time. The barriers to Hyperloop becoming a reality are enormous - and it's not just about technology. Part of any visionary's CV is the ability to ignore the naysayers and focus on your vision. If and when you succeed, everyone backtracks and says they knew you were a genius all along. Elon Musk is the sort of chap that is used to people telling him he's wrong. When he set out to make electric cars appeal to petrolheads, he had a lot of people to convince - but somehow, and on the brink of bankruptcy, he got some investors on board. Yet an awful lot stands in Hyperloop's way. Literally. Christopher Merian, chief engineer on MIT's effort, told me that the key problem with his pod - and the Hyperloop concept in general - is that it can't handle corners. So the Hyperloop tube would need to take a rather Roman approach, and go in an almost complete straight line from A to B. If the proposed route of San Francisco to Los Angeles is to be realised, you're looking at slicing through some of the most beautiful sights the natural world has to offer, not to mention acre after acre of land belonging to people who may not be too keen on a big fat tube being plonked outside their front door. Philippe Kirschen, MIT's team captain, told me he thinks this will lead to Hyperloop being built in a different part of the world with a less strenuous regulatory environment. Indeed it's hard to imagine anywhere in the US that would be suitable for Hyperloop, short of shelling out monstrous payouts and a free Tesla or two to people whose lives have been uprooted. But let's put that aside and, for the sake of argument, say an agreement has been made and a route between San Francisco and Los Angeles is built. It works, it's safe and it's pretty darn marvellous, all told. Except it is really, really expensive. Mr Musk says the cost of building the route would be in the region of 6bn (Â£4.1bn), an estimate most agree is extremely conservative. Some are calling Hyperloop the new Concorde which, despite being a glorious piece of innovation, ultimately failed due to regulations - it wasn't allowed to fly at supersonic speeds over land - and a lack of profitability. A return ticket on Concorde would see you part with several thousand pounds or dollars. Which over time was not considered to be worthwhile trade to save a few hours. How much will a ticket for Hyperloop cost? MIT's pod design - which they said can be scaled up - will likely be able to carry around 20 people at once. Unless the Hyperloop system can handle a great number of pods leaving a station in very quick succession, tickets for those pods will need to be extremely high in order to make the system economically viable. Furthermore, if Hyperloop runs from San Francisco to Los Angeles, it will be competing with the currently under-construction California High Speed Rail. The network - due to open in 2025 - promises a journey time of two hours and 40 minutes. Each train will be able to carry well over a thousand people. Tickets, surely, will be a lot cheaper than Hyperloop. It would leave Hyperloop as an option only for the rich. Public support no doubt would evaporate. I was something of a partypooper at MIT's event, I'll admit - putting all these points to the team on a night designed to celebrate their outstanding efforts thus far. The math(s) not adding up was a concern, they said - but at the very least, the hope is that developing Hyperloop will create something, even if it's not the transportation of the future. There could be many industrial uses for an environmentally friendly Hyperloop-style system. In 50 years, when we look back at the hopeful, expectant faces in that photograph, it seems unlikely that we'll see them as the team that changed the way we travel. But that's not to say developing Hyperloop - a clean, perhaps revolutionary technology - won't have been worth it.

Imagine getting inside a special pod that whooshes you through a long tube very, very fast. It's kind of like a super speedy train, but you travel inside a tube instead of on tracks.  A man named Elon Musk, who is a really smart inventor, thought of this idea. He believes that with Hyperloop, people can travel very long distances in a short time—like going from San Francisco to Los Angeles in just 30 minutes! Wow, that's really fast!  Right now, many teams of people, including one from a big school called MIT, are trying to make Elon Musk's idea come true. But it's a very big challenge because the Hyperloop needs lots of room to travel in a straight line, and it might cost a lot of money to build and use. Even though it's not easy, working on the Hyperloop project could lead to some great inventions that help people in other ways.

Write an article based on this summary: Theresa May says a Conservative government will not raise VAT if she wins the general election.","output":"Title: Theresa May Pledges Not to Raise VAT Under a Conservative Government Introduction: In the run-up to the general election, British Prime Minister Theresa May has made a significant commitment on behalf of the Conservative Party, promising that a Conservative government will not increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) if she emerges victorious in the polls. This announcement comes as part of her broader efforts to attract voters and secure a strengthened mandate for her government. Step 1: Analyze the Background and Motive To better understand the context of May's announcement, it is crucial to analyze the background and motives behind it. Over the years, VAT has become a touchstone issue in British politics, with political parties varying in their stances on this tax on the consumption of goods and services. By explicitly committing not to raise VAT, May is taking a stance that could curry favor with a wide range of voters seeking relief from increasing living expenses. Step 2: Elaborate on the Impact of This Pledge on the General Population A promise to keep VAT the same under a Conservative government sends a message to the British public that the party is mindful of their financial concerns and committed to maintaining a stable environment for businesses and consumers. This commitment to avoid additional financial burdens for the general population could be a strategic move in winning over undecided voters. Step 3: Discuss the Potential Opposition Response It is important to anticipate the opposition's response to May's pledge. Labour and Liberal Democrat parties might attempt to exploit this declaration by raising concerns about how a Conservative government intends to maintain fiscal prudence without increasing VAT. They may question whether this would lead to more borrowing or cuts in public spending to offset lost revenue. Step 4: Contemplate Possible Outcomes Assuming May's promises holds true, and she does not raise VAT, this could lead to increased support and a stronger mandate for the Conservative government, engendering a sense of stability for the British economy. However, the pledge could also become a double-edged sword, as failure to uphold the promise could result in significant backlash and a loss of public trust. Conclusion: Theresa May's pledge not to raise VAT under a Conservative government has significant implications for the overall electoral strategy of her party in the upcoming general election. While the commitment attracts voters seeking financial relief, it also invites scrutiny from opposition parties. The ultimate outcome hinges on the Conservatives' ability to maintain fiscal prudence without resorting to an increase in VAT, as well as the public's trust in May to deliver on her promises."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Dr. Phyllis Hollenbeck, a primary care physician, took a job at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Jackson, Miss., in 2008 expecting fulfilling work and a lighter patient load than she had had in private practice.                              What she found was quite different: 13-hour workdays fueled by large patient loads that kept growing as colleagues quit and were not replaced.      Appalled by what she saw, Dr. Hollenbeck filed a whistle-blower complaint and changed jobs. A subsequent investigation by the Department of Veterans Affairs concluded last fall that indeed the Jackson hospital did not have enough primary care doctors, resulting in nurse practitioners’ handling far too many complex cases and in numerous complaints from veterans about delayed care. “It was unethical to put us in that position,” Dr. Hollenbeck said of the overstressed primary care unit in Jackson. “Your heart gets broken.”      Her complaint is resonating across the 150-hospital Veterans Affairs medical system after the department’s inspector general released findings on Wednesday that the Phoenix medical center falsified data about long waiting times for veterans seeking doctor appointments.      In Washington, the number of lawmakers in Congress calling for the resignation of Eric Shinseki, the Veterans Affairs secretary, grew by late Thursday to nearly 100 — including almost a dozen Democrats — as President Obama prepared to receive an internal audit on Friday from Mr. Shinseki assessing the breadth of misconduct at veterans hospitals. White House aides declined to say whether Mr. Obama would ask Mr. Shinseki to step down.      At the heart of the falsified data in Phoenix, and possibly many other veterans hospitals, is an acute shortage of doctors, particularly primary care ones, to handle a patient population swelled both by aging veterans from the Vietnam War and younger ones who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to congressional officials, Veterans Affairs doctors and medical industry experts.      The department says it is trying to fill 400 vacancies to add to its roster of primary care doctors, which last year numbered 5,100.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “The doctors are good but they are overworked, and they feel inadequate in the face of the inordinate demands made on them,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. “The exploding workload is suffocating them.” The inspector general’s report also pointed to another factor that may explain why hospital officials in Phoenix and elsewhere might have falsified wait-time data: pressures to excel in the annual performance reviews used to determine raises, bonuses, promotions and other benefits. Instituted widely 20 years ago to increase accountability for weak employees as well as reward strong ones, those reviews and their attendant benefits may have become perverse incentives for manipulating wait-time data, some lawmakers and experts say.      Representative Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said whistle-blowers at several veterans hospitals had told his staff members that they would be threatened if they failed to alter data to make patient-access numbers look good for their supervisors, one reason he has called for a criminal investigation into the Veterans Affairs hospital system.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “Fear was instilled in lower-level employees by their superiors, and those superiors did not want long wait times,” Mr. Miller said in an interview. “Bonuses are tied directly to the waiting times of the veterans, and anybody that showed long wait times was less likely to receive a favorable review.”      The precise role incentives and performance reviews might have played in falsifying waiting-list data remains unclear. In Phoenix, the inspector general’s office said, investigators plan to interview scheduling supervisors and administrators to “identify management’s involvement in manipulating wait times.”      But documents suggest that using the data in annual performance reviews may be commonplace. One review at a Pennsylvania veterans medical center showed that a significant portion of the director’s job rating was tied to “timely and appropriate access,” which would include waiting times for doctor appointments. One of those goals would be met only if nearly all patients were seen within 14 days of their desired appointment date — a requirement not found in the private hospital industry.      Schemes to disguise wait times generally followed a handful of approaches, whistle-blowers and officials in Congress say. In Phoenix, where administrators were overwhelmed by new patients, many veterans were not logged into the official electronic waiting list, making it easier to cloak delays in providing care.      Another strategy, according to documents and interviews, was for Veterans Affairs employees to record the first date a doctor was available as the desired date requested by the veteran, even if they wanted an earlier date.      “Yes, it is gaming the system a bit,” one employee at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Cheyenne, Wyo., explained in an email to colleagues. “But you have to know the rules of the game you are playing, and when we exceed the 14-day measure, the front office gets very upset.”      In Jackson, Dr. Hollenbeck reported that hospital administrators created “ghost clinics” in which veterans were assigned to nonexistent primary care clinics to make it appear that they were receiving timely care.      And in Albuquerque, an employee at the veterans center said some doctors were shocked when they received a memo a few months ago stating that 20 percent of physician “performance pay” would be doled out only to doctors who found a way to limit patient follow-up visits to an average of two a year — a tactic to reduce waiting times by persuading veterans to make fewer appointments.      “Clinic staff were instructed to enter false information into veterans’ charts because it would improve the data about clinic availability,” states a whistle-blower complaint filed by the employee, who did not want to be identified. “The reason anyone would care to do this is that clinic availability is a performance measure, and there are incentives for management to meet performance measures.”      Experts point out that performance reviews and incentives were a crucial element in transforming the Veterans Affairs medical system, considered a medical backwater after the Vietnam War, into a national health care system that, for all its problems, is generally well regarded.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Debra A. Draper, the director of the Health Care Government Accountability Office, said that performance-contract incentives were only one possible explanation for inaccurate wait-list data, and that other factors included lack of oversight and training.      Photo      Most experts agree that soaring demand for veterans’ care has outpaced the availability of doctors in many locations, and that high turnover is a major problem. In the past three years, primary-care appointments have leapt 50 percent while the department’s staff of primary care doctors has grown by only 9 percent, according to department statistics.      Those primary care doctors are supposed to be responsible for about 1,200 patients each, but many now treat upward of 2,000, said J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents nurses and other support staff. He said the department spent too much hiring midlevel administrators and not enough on doctors and nurses, a complaint shared by some lawmakers and veterans groups.      The department said this week that it was reviewing the size of patient panels at its hundreds of outpatient clinics and assessing whether more could provide night and weekend hours. The department also said it would increase the number of patients it referred to private medical care, to reduce waiting times.      Critics and supporters of the department agree that many facilities do not have enough physicians. But they disagree about whether that is because the department has poured too much of its hefty federal budget increases into hiring midlevel managers instead of clinicians, or whether the system simply does not have enough funding — or a large enough pool of doctors to hire from — to keep up.      Supporters of the department also note that hospitals everywhere are struggling to find primary care doctors. But some experts say the department has additional hurdles, including lower pay scales. Primary care doctors and internists at veterans centers generally earn from about 98,000 to 195,000, compared with private-sector primary care physicians whose total median compensation was 221,000 in 2012, according to the Medical Group Management Association, a trade group.      Many veteran medical center directors tend to make 160,000 to 190,000; according to 2012 data, those directors given performance awards typically received 8,000 to 15,000 more.      Dr. Atul Grover, chief public policy officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, said the department’s doctor shortage came down to a simple fact: “It’s just harder to attract physicians to care for more challenging patients while paying them less.”      There are long delays for specialty care, too, veterans say. Kent Carson, a former Marine with epilepsy, said he had tried to make an appointment with his neurologist at the veterans hospital in Nashville after having five seizures in four days in 2012. But Mr. Carson, 29, said he was told he would have to wait more than two months — or go to the emergency room. He has since switched to private insurance through his job as an accountant in Lenexa, Kan. The Nashville hospital did not respond to a request for comment.      “I have seizures, but it’s not life-threatening,” Mr. Carson said. “But I really do worry about vets who have more serious problems.” ||||| Story highlights Obama accepts VA secretary's resignation, says Shinseki doesn't want to be a distraction      Shinseki says his commitment to veterans drove his decision to resign      The move comes after months of reports about problems with the VA medical system      Eric Shinseki resigned Friday as the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, leaving behind the daunting task of repairing a broken health care system that has left thousands of veterans at risk as they wait for medical care.      Shinseki's resignation concluded a firestorm of criticism and growing calls for him to step down following revelations of sometimes deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at VA hospitals, allegations exposed by CNN in a series of exclusive reports.      Details of the delays were first exposed by CNN last November in an investigation into two VA hospitals in the Southeast. Since then, CNN's reporting has expanded to include numerous other VA hospitals, culminating with details about secret waiting lists at the Phoenix VA that may have played a role in the deaths of 40 veterans.      President Barack Obama went before reporters at the White House minutes after meeting with Shinseki, saying the retired Army general told him \\"the VA needs new leadership\\" to address widespread issues that were chronicled in new reports this week. Obama said Shinseki \\"does not want to be a distraction.\\"      JUST WATCHED New details about Shinseki resignation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New details about Shinseki resignation 02:07      \\"That was Ric's judgment on behalf of his fellow veterans, and I agree. We don't have time for distractions. We need to fix the problem,\\" Obama said.      Calls for Shinseki's resignation snowballed in recent days from across the political spectrum -- Republicans and Democrats, as well as veterans' advocacy groups -- because of the misconduct .      In a farewell message to VA employees, Shinseki didn't address the scandal specifically but did say he resigned with veterans' interests in mind.      \\"My personal and professional commitment and my loyalty to veterans, their families and our survivors was the driving force behind that decision,\\" he said. \\"That loyalty has never wavered, and it will never wane.\\"      Shinseki says 'situation can be fixed,' but not by him      Earlier Friday, Shinseki announced steps to address the VA shortcomings, including removing senior leaders in the Phoenix VA medical system , eliminating performance awards for VA leaders in 2014 and wait times as a metric for evaluations and accelerating care to veterans.      He also apologized to veterans and Congress, but declared: \\"This situation can be fixed.\\"      But Shinseki won't be part of the solution.      He went to the White House to present Obama with findings from his internal audit of what was happening in the VA system, including that many audited facilities had \\"questionable scheduling practices\\" that signaled a \\"systemic lack of integrity.\\"      The President acknowledged that scheduling issues didn't rise to the attention of Shinseki, whom he praised as a man who \\"has served his country with honor for nearly 50 years.\\"      At the same time, Obama said that he and Shinseki agreed that a shift in leadership was necessary.      For now, Sloan Gibson -- a Shinseki deputy -- will head the VA until a new secretary is named and confirmed.      \\"Part of that is going to be technology. Part of that is management,\\" the President said. \\"But as Ric Shinseki himself indicated, there is a need for a change in culture within the VHA, and perhaps the VHA as a whole -- or the VA as a whole that makes sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so that things can be fixed.\\"      Breaking open the scandal      Problems in the VA system date back decades, but CNN's reporting of long waits at VA hospitals brought the issue into national focus at the end of 2013.      An April report by CNN in which sources said 40 veterans died at a Phoenix VA facility that used secret waiting lists to cover up the problem prompted angry calls for action.      The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care.      CNN also obtained an e-mail written by an employee at a Wyoming VA clinic that said staff was instructed to \\"game the system\\" to make the clinic appear more efficient.      A preliminary inspector general's report made public Wednesday described a \\"systemic\\" practice of manipulating appointments and wait lists at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix.      According to the report, at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment or were placed on a waiting list at the Phoenix VA, raising the question of just how many more may have been \\"forgotten or lost\\" in the system.      In a recent USA Today opinion piece, Shinseki ordered VA officials to contact each of these veterans \\"in order to bring the care they need and deserve.\\"      The latest report by the VA inspector general's office and Shinseki's auditors indicated a link between employee bonuses and covering up patient wait times.      There also have been calls for a criminal investigation into fraudulent record-keeping to cover up delays at VA hospitals. Obama said Friday that would be up to the Justice Department, which has been collecting information but has not launched any investigation.      Shortly before he resigned, Shinseki told a veterans group that he was shocked by the inspector general's report, especially the prevalence of wait lists for veterans needing medical care.      \\"That breach of integrity is irresponsible, it is indefensible and unacceptable to me,\\" he told the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans just before heading over to his final meeting with Obama.      \\"I said when this situation began weeks to months ago and I thought the problem was limited and isolated because I believed that. I no longer believe that. It is systemic,\\" he said.      At the same time, the VA chief of more than five years said that others had misled him.      \\"I was too trusting of some, and I accepted as accurate reports that I now know to have been misleading with regard to patient wait times,\\" he said. \\"I can't explain the lack of integrity among some of the leaders of our health care facilities. This is something I rarely encountered during 38 years in uniform and so I will not defend it because it's indefensible, but I can take responsibility for it and I do.\\"      Whistleblower: VA was 'way too focused on ... good numbers'      As the accusations mounted -- including the latest one in which Reps. Mike Doyle and Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania claimed 700 veterans had been placed on a primary care waiting list for doctor appointments at the Pittsburgh VA center, with some waiting since 2012 -- so too did the pressure on Shinseki.      Politicians largely applauded Shinseki's resignation on Friday, even as they said that the VA needed to do more than put new people in his place to resolve its shortcomings.      \\"The denial of care to our veterans is a national disgrace, and it's fitting that the person who oversees the Department of Veterans Affairs has accepted responsibility for this growing scandal and resigned,\\" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said in a statement.      Meanwhile, a VA whistleblower who told CNN about the problems at the Phoenix facility said Friday he was saddened by Shinseki's resignation under such circumstances.      \\"The VA administrators got way too focused on having good numbers and they forgot the most important mandate, the reason we all work at the VA -- to take care of veterans, to save their lives and give them good medical care,\\" Dr. Sam Foote said.      \\"The next secretary's biggest challenge will be to get that refocused and make sure the number one job is taking care of veterans - not worrying about their bureaucratic careers,\\" Foote added. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Dr. Phyllis Hollenbeck, a doctor at a Veterans Affairs medical center, was shocked to find much longer work hours and larger patient loads than she had anticipated. Many doctors at the center ended up quitting due to the stress, which only increased the workload for the remaining staff. Dr. Hollenbeck ended up filing a complaint about the conditions, leading to an investigation that confirmed the hospital had too few primary care doctors. This problem was found to be common across many Veterans Affairs medical centers, with a shortage of doctors being the primary issue. This shortage resulted in long waiting times for veterans seeking care. It was also found that some hospitals were falsifying data about these waiting times, leading to increased calls for the resignation of the Veterans Affairs secretary, Eric Shinseki.  Performance reviews and incentives were identified as one possible reason why hospital staff were falsifying wait-time data, as these reviews were linked to promotions, bonuses, and raises. An ongoing investigation plans to determine how exactly this played into the issue.  Some healthcare workers reported practices such as creating \\"ghost clinics\\" in order to make it appear that care was timely, or recording the first available appointment date as the date requested by the patient. However, the problem boils down to a lack of doctors and an increasing patient load, causing wait times to soar, a problem the department is working to address. There are criticisms about whether the department has been hiring too many administrators and not enough doctors and nurses, or whether the department simply does not have the necessary funding. Repairs and improvements to the system are ongoing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Stress is fl natural part of everyday life.There is no way to avoid it, since it takes many and varied forms-driving in traffic,problems with personal relationships are all different forms of stress. _ .A certain amount of stress is vital to provide motivation and give purpose to life.It is only when the stress gets out of control that it can lead to poor performance and ill health. The amount of stress a person can withstand depends very much on the individual.Some people are not afraid of stress,and such characters are obviously prime material for managerial responsibilities.Others lose heart at the first sight of unusual difficulties.When exposed to stress,in whatever form,we react both chemically and physically.In fact we make a choice between \\"fight\\" or \\"fright\\" and in more primitive days the choice made the difference between life and death.The crisis we meet today are unlikely to be so extreme,but however little the stress,it involves the same response.All the energy is shifted to cope with the stress.It is when such a reaction lasts long,through continued exposure to stress,that health becomes endangered.Such serious conditions as high blood pressure and heart disease have established links with stress. Stress in some people produces stomach disorders,while others experience tension headaches.Since we cannot remove stress from our 1ires,We need to find ways to cope with it. Question: People are finding less and less time for relaxing themselves because  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"they are suffering from the effects of stress\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the answer \\"they are suffering from the effects of stress\\" is not entirely accurate as the direct cause for people finding less and less time for relaxation. The primary reason people are finding less time for relaxation is due to the increasing pace of life and the habit of constantly rushing from one task to another, as mentioned in the article. This constant on-the-go lifestyle leaves people with hardly any time to sit still and do absolutely nothing, resulting in less time spent on relaxation. However, it is important to understand that the effects of stress are related to the lack of relaxation. The article emphasizes that stress is a natural part of everyday life and cannot be avoided as it takes various forms, such as driving in traffic or dealing with personal relationship issues. This stress, when experienced in moderate amounts, can be essential for providing motivation and giving purpose to life. It becomes detrimental when it gets out of control, leading to poor performance and ill health. The amount of stress an individual can withstand greatly depends on that person's ability to handle it. Some people are predisposed to thrive under stressful conditions, while others may crumble at the first sign of difficulty. Prolonged exposure to stress can eventually lead to serious health issues such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Since we cannot entirely eliminate stress from our lives, it is crucial to find ways to cope with it. One such method is setting aside time for relaxation. The article highlights that relaxation is essential for maintaining a healthy mind and body, so finding more time for relaxation will help alleviate the negative effects of stress. In summary, though the answer \\"they are suffering from the effects of stress\\" is not the direct reason people find less and less time to relax, the diminishing amount of relaxation time does coincide with increasing stress levels and their consequences. It is essential to incorporate relaxation into our lives to mitigate the effects of stress and maintain overall mental and physical well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When it comes to footwear, Marcus loves his birkenstocks and his flip-flops, but the","output":"moment winter arrives, he quickly realizes the need for more supportive and warm options to protect his feet from the harsh cold. In the search for the perfect winter footwear, Marcus went on a mission to explore the wide range of choices available in the market, weighing the pros and cons of each amidst the countless styles, materials, and features. One of his first considerations was functionality. Given the unpredictable winter weather, Marcus needed boots that could withstand snow, sleet, and icy conditions. Thus, he began his search by focusing on waterproof boots with adequate insulation and a non-slip sole, as well as a gusseted tongue to keep water, snow, and debris out. Marcus was also keen on finding boots that offered a proper fit and support. He has slightly wider feet, so he required a boot designed for people with similar foot anatomy. In addition, adequate arch support and cushioning were crucial for his comfort, as he often spends long hours on his feet. Moreover, he wanted to avoid boots that would restrict his movements or cause any discomfort during extended periods of walking. As a fashion-conscious individual, Marcus didn't want to compromise on style while striving for functionality. He wanted winter boots that not only fulfilled his practical footwear needs but also complemented his wardrobe. He was drawn to some sleek designs that looked stylish and elegant, without looking too bulky, while still offering the necessary protection. With his preferences and requirements in mind, Marcus researched various brands and models to make an informed decision. He took note of customer reviews on multiple platforms, comparing durability, warmth, comfort, and overall performance between different choices. Furthermore, he consulted friends, family, and colleagues to get their opinions and personal experiences. Some options that caught his attention during his research were: 1. Sorel Caribou Boots: These boots are known for their excellent insulation, waterproofing, and durability. Marcus was particularly interested in the removable felt liner, which provides extra warmth and comfort to feet in even the most frigid conditions.   2. UGG Butte Boots: Marcus was drawn to UGGs due to their iconic appearance and reputation for cozy sheepskin linings. However, what truly sold him on the Butte model was their winter-ready Vibram outsole, combining functionality with the brand's trademark comfort. 3. Timberland Earthkeepers Original Leather 6-Inch Boots: Crafted with eco-friendly materials and offering a long-lasting, waterproof wear, Timberland's Earthkeepers caught Marcus' eye for their rugged yet stylish design. 4. The North Face Shellista III Mid: This boot's unique blend of style and function made it stand out to Marcus. The Shellista III Mid boasts a waterproof leather upper with a faux-fur collar, offering both warmth and a fashionable flair. After taking the time to try on different models and assessing their comfort, warmth, and compatibility with his wardrobe, Marcus finally settled on a pair of boots that struck the perfect balance of style and functionality. These boots not only kept his feet warm and dry during the harsh winter months but also allowed him to express his sense of style without compromising comfort. As the winter season wore on and the challenging weather conditions persisted, Marcus firmly believed he made the right decision in choosing his new winter boots. The endless compliments he received coupled with the satisfaction knowing his feet were protected and comfortable made every step of his journey well worth it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Membership declined throughout the twentieth century, but experienced an increase early in the 21st century, as have other small Christian denominations. Significant Protestant denominations are the Presbyterian Church and Methodist Church. Immigration has contributed to a growth in Hindu and Muslim populations.

By Lee Moran Last updated at 9:51 AM on 24th November 2011 She was ETA's green-eyed femme fatale - who lured policemen into her bed before calmly gunning down their colleagues days later. But Idoia Lopez Riano, dubbed La Tigresa (The Tigress) for her legendary sexual prowess, has turned from the organisation's heroine to hate-figure - after she renounced her violence and said sorry for her crimes. Riano, now 47 and who was locked up for 1,500 years in 2003, became one of the Basque Separatist group's leading commandos during the 1980s. Scroll down for video... Cuffed: Idoia Lopez Riano, dubbed La Tigresa, has renounced her past violence. Pictured here at Madrid's Barajas airport following extradition to Spain in 2001 The name of the organisation - Euskadi ta Askatasuna - means","output":"Basque Homeland and Liberty in the Basque language. ETA was founded in 1959 in response to the oppression of the Basque people, their culture, and their language during the Franco dictatorship in Spain. The group sought to achieve an independent and socialist Basque country through armed struggle and targeted attacks against Spanish government officials, military personnel, and security forces. In its quest for independence, ETA was responsible for the deaths of more than 800 people and numerous bombings, kidnappings, and acts of sabotage. ETA's violent tactics were widely condemned both domestically and internationally, leading many countries, including Spain, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom, to designate it as a terrorist organization. This ultimately resulted in a crackdown on the group's activities, making it increasingly difficult for it to continue its armed struggle and leading to a decline in its membership and support base. The Tigress, as she was known, was hardly the only female member of ETA, but her high-profile violent acts and her notoriety for using sex as a weapon made her a powerful symbol for the organization during its peak. However, Riano's eventual renunciation of her violent deeds and her apology for her crimes illustrate how even the most committed and notorious members of the group could change their perspective on the path towards independence for the Basque people. She is just one of many former ETA members who have since denounced the group's tactics and sought to atone for their past actions. In response to the dwindling support and increased pressure from the authorities, ETA has experienced a significant transformation in the last two decades. In 2011, the group declared a permanent ceasefire and committed to a nonviolent strategy in its pursuit of Basque independence. Six years later, in 2017, ETA announced that it had completely disarmed, and in 2018, the group formally dissolved itself, officially bringing an end to one of Europe's longest-running and bloodiest separatist conflicts. As the Basque region enjoys increased autonomy and recognition of its unique cultural identity within Spain, the path to full independence remains a contested topic. Today, many Basques continue to advocate for greater independence through political means and peaceful activism. While the likelihood of achieving complete independence may be uncertain, the broader goal for many Basques is the preservation and celebration of their distinct language, culture, and identity within a unified and diverse Spain. Time will tell how the Basque people will continue to pursue their aspirations and what role their unique history will play in shaping their future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes.

Their commonplace life took an exciting turn when Laura, a former professional soccer player, develops a sudden obsession with the local underdog amateur soccer team, The Cloverdale Kickers, after witnessing one of their matches on television. One notable afternoon, Laura finds herself screaming at the TV, driven by her frustration as she watches the Kickers lose another game due to lackluster techniques. Kevin, who has always been supportive of his wife's eccentricities, grows concerned about Laura's deepening obsession and the sudden outburst. Laura's frustration isn't only fueled by the team's lack of success, but also her regret over a career cut short due to an injury. She sees potential in the Kickers but is upset at their lack of proper training and direction. Unable to bear watching the team lose, Laura decides to offer her help and ends up becoming the Kickers' new coach. Her appointment is met with doubts and disdain, especially from arrogant star player, Derek. Laura struggles but remains determined, and she tries every tactic and strategy to lead the team to victory. Kevin, understanding his wife's passion and past, becomes her silent pillar of strength. Meanwhile, Laura's loud confrontations with the TV continue, each based on their match performance. These scenes become the comic relief in this otherwise inspirational drama. Laura's fierce spirit and unrelenting perseverance eventually yield results, reforming the motley crew of amateur athletes into a formidable team. In the climactic final match, Laura's strategies outplay the reigning champions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Raymond Colin Wilkins, MBE (14 September 1956 - 4 April 2018) was an English football player and coach. Born in a footballing family with his father and three brothers involved in the game, Wilkins played as a midfielder. He began his career at Chelsea, where he was appointed captain at the age of 18, and later played for the likes of Manchester United, Milan, Queens Park Rangers, and Rangers. He won 84 caps for the England national football team from 1976 to 1986, playing at UEFA Euro 1980 and the 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cups. Wilkins signed with A.C. Milan in the summer of 1984. He later remarked that the most difficult part of adapting to the Italian game was the focus on fitness - the coaching staff made him work to reduce his body fat levels and Wilkins described the result as being in the best shape of his career. The Italian team was struggling during this period, having suffered relegation in the 1981-82 Serie A, and Wilkins was joined by fellow Englishman Mark Hateley (himself replacing another compatriot - Luther Blissett). The only foreign players in the squad, the pair helped the team to victory over rivals Inter in the Milan Derby that October, winning plaudits from Italian press and the club's fans. In his first year there, Wilkins played 28 Serie A games to bring the team to fifth in the league and also won a runner-up medal in the Coppa Italia (having eliminated Inter in the semis).  The following season he remained a key player in Milan's midfield, appearing in 29 league games and scoring two goals - one late goal to salvage a draw at Avellino and another goal the following game against Sampdoria. These were the only Serie A goals of his career. Overall, the team struggled for goals, with Pietro Paolo Virdis's total of 13 making him the club's only goalscorer in double figures that year. The club also suffered off the pitch, with owner Giuseppe Farina absconding to South Africa following accusations of bribery and theft.  In Wilkin's final season there (1986-87), he fell out of the first team structure, following the signing of Roberto Donadoni and the continued presence of both Agostino Di Bartolomei and Alberigo Evani. The team finished fifth in the league, beating Inter twice, in Silvio Berlusconi's first year as owner. Wilkins played 105 games (74 in Serie A) for Milan between 1984 and 1987. Corriere della Sera eulogised him as a \\"serious and meticulous professional who was immediately appreciated for his long and precise passes\\".  Wilkins signed for Paris Saint-Germain in the middle of 1987, but this proved to be short-lived: he failed to break into the team ahead of Gabriel Calderon and Safet Susic so he eagerly took the option to signed for Rangers for PS250,000 that November. At the Scottish club he won two league titles and one Scottish League Cup under Graeme Souness. He achieved cult status for his volley in the Old Firm game against reigning champions Celtic in August 1988, giving Rangers the lead in a 5-1 win against their rivals. Despite only playing two seasons for the Glasgow club, he was inducted into their Hall of Fame. Did he win any awards or recognition?","output":"Raymond Colin Wilkins, also known as Ray Wilkins, was a talented football player and coach well-liked by fans and the press.

Write an article with the title: \\"Officer's forceful removal of student made sheriff 'want to throw up'\\"","output":"Title: Officer's Forceful Removal of Student Made Sheriff 'Want to Throw Up' Introduction In a recent incident that has garnered nationwide attention, a school resource officer was caught on video forcibly removing a student from a classroom. The footage, which quickly went viral, shows the officer using excessive force to subdue the student, an action that was not only shocking to the public, but also to the very authorities responsible for ensuring security and safety within schools. In response to the incident, the local sheriff publicly admitted that the video footage \\"made him want to throw up.\\" Following is an overview of the situation, its implications, and the reactions it has sparked. The Incident The incident occurred at a high school in the United States, where an altercation broke out between a student and a school resource officer. The situation escalated quickly, leading the officer to forcefully remove the student from the classroom, using techniques that were clearly not within the bounds of standard protocol. Although the exact reason for the officer's intervention is unclear, the video shows him employing a chokehold and slamming the student on the floor.  Sheriff's Reaction Upon learning of the incident, the local sheriff expressed his horror and disgust at the officer's actions. In a public statement, he noted that the video \\"made him want to throw up,\\" underscoring just how troubling the footage is, even to law enforcement professionals. The sheriff emphasized that the officer's actions were not representative of the dedication and professionalism exhibited by the vast majority of officers within his department or other agencies. Legal Implications Following the incident, the school resource officer was placed on administrative leave and is now facing a thorough investigation by outside authorities. Depending on the outcome of the investigation, the officer could face disciplinary measures, including termination or even criminal charges. Beyond the individual officer, the incident has sparked a broader conversation regarding school resource officers, the use of force, and the need for better training and oversight. Public Outcry and Impact on Relations The disturbing footage has not only appalled the sheriff but also ignited a firestorm of public outrage. Parents, students, and community members have voiced their concerns and many are demanding immediate action to ensure that such an incident is never repeated. This event has further strained the already tense relationship between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve, and underscores the importance of promoting transparency and fostering trust. Conclusion The forceful removal of a student by a school resource officer is an incident that should concern all individuals involved in the education and protection of young people. The emotional response of the local sheriff is a powerful indicator of just how distressing the incident is. It is now crucial for law enforcement agencies to closely examine their policies and practices to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. As we move forward, it is essential to prioritize the safety and well-being of all students and ensure that those sworn to protect them uphold the highest standards of conduct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Bank of England, which issues banknotes for England and Wales, never had a £100 note in regular circulation in its current series of banknotes. However, it had a £100 note known as the \\"White Notes,\\" which were last issued during the 1940s and were gradually phased out, being replaced by the £50 note as the highest denomination in circulation. On the other hand, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their respective issuing authorities, and they still have £100 notes in circulation. In Scotland, there are three issuing banks – Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Clydesdale Bank – all of which currently print and circulate £100 notes. Similarly, in Northern Ireland, there are four issuing banks – Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank, Ulster Bank, and First Trust Bank – all of which also issue and circulate £100 notes. While £100 notes are legal currency in the entire United Kingdom, they are less commonly seen, particularly outside of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some retailers may be reluctant to accept these higher denomination notes due to the risk of forgery and their unfamiliarity.

The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.Darius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father's last words were not a warning, but a challenge.

Tara (Sarita Choudhury) is an upper-caste princess while Maya (Indira Varma) is her beautiful servant. The two girls are best friends, but an undercurrent of jealousy and resentment is caused by Tara's haughtiness, symbolized by the fact that Maya is given Tara's hand-me-down clothes and never anything new to wear. As the girls approach marriageable age, Tara resents that Maya is a better classical dancer than she is, and that her parents and hunchback brother, Prince Bikram (aka \\"Biki\\") show affection for her servant. Tara is prepared to marry Prince Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews), and Maya is forced into the role of the inferior servant at their wedding festival. When the prince comes to view his future wife, he is instantly infatuated with Maya instead. Noticing this, Tara spits in Maya's face, sending her from the wedding in tears. Maya decides to take revenge when she chances on Raj sleeping alone, before he has completed the marriage rites with Tara. Maya has her first sexual experience with Raj, but unknown to both, Tara's brother, Prince \\"Biki\\", hides and watches the two of them together. Biki is crushed that his childhood infatuation has slept with his future brother-in-law, but at first keeps the knowledge to himself, and the wedding rites are completed the next day. As Tara is leaving home as a newly-wedded bride to Raj, Maya tells her that just as Maya wore the princess's used clothes all her life, Tara will now have something Maya has used. During her wedding night, Tara, a sheltered virgin full of romantic dreams, is hesitant to consummate their relationship.

Answer: Labor Day is an American federal holiday observed on the first Monday in September, that celebrates the economic and social contributions of workers. Question: what holiday is first weekend of september A:","output":"Yes, your answer is correct. Labor Day is indeed an American federal holiday that is observed on the first Monday in September. This holiday is a tribute to the contributions that workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of the country. Established in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, Labor Day was made a federal holiday in 1894. Labor Day traditionally marks the end of the summer season and is often celebrated with parties, parades, and various labor-related events. Many people enjoy outdoor activities like picnicking, barbecuing, or fireworks in the evening. It is also a time for many businesses to hold sales, and for sports organizations to hold games. This holiday historically is significant for the labor movement with roots tracing back to the Industrial Revolution, when workers were fighting for fair wages, reasonable hours, and safer working conditions. Protests and strikes were the main tools used by labor activists to seek reform. Therefore, if the question is \\"What holiday is the first weekend of September?\\" the correct answer would indeed be Labor Day, assuming the context is referring to holidays in the United States.

Question: What do Newton and Hannibal discover ? Movie plot title: Pacific Rim Movie plot: The film begins in 2013. Deep beneath the Pacific Ocean, a fissure opens up, that leads to another dimension. Through the fissure, a giant monster appears, and destroys portions of San Francisco. After many days and countless lives, the creature is defeated by human military forces.However, what seemed to be an isolated attack builds, as more creatures begin to come through the fissure, attacking coastal cities around the Pacific. The World unites to stop the invaders, and build The Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended to stop the creatures.Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots, their memories linked together in The Drift, synchronizing their movements to maneuver the massive machines.As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn the tides, and take down the creatures (known as Kaiju). Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made. As well, the dead Kaiju are soon seen as a black-market commodity, their parts sold off for various collections and medicinal purposes.But just as the war seems to be turning in humanity's favor, the Kaiju's attacks become more frequent and more brutal.In 2020, seven years after the fissure opened, one of the more famous Jaeger duos, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam), and his older brother, Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) have become heroes with an impeccable record of defeating Kaijus. Pilots of the Jaeger named \\"Gipsy Danger,\\" they are sent off to stop a category 3 Kaiju heading towards Anchorage. The beast is larger and more powerful than previous category 3s and will be a challenge for the team. Though the information on their monitors shows a fishing boat in the path of the attack, the Becketts are told their priority is to protect Anchorage.Even so, they disobey orders,... Answer:","output":"In the movie Pacific Rim, scientists Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) play crucial roles in understanding the Kaiju threat and finding a way to close the interdimensional fissure from which the monsters emerge.  Newton, a \\"Kaiju groupie\\" biologist, and Hannibal, a mathematician, are initially at odds with each other due to their contrasting methods. Newton is eager to study a living Kaiju brain in order to learn more about their origins and motives, while Hannibal is focused on predicting the patterns of their attacks based on his mathematical algorithms. However, after Newton mind-melds (Drifts) with a piece of a Kaiju brain, he discovers that the monsters are not just random creatures but are, in fact, bioweapons sent by an alien race called the Precursors. The Precursors are colonizers who want to wipe out entire planets' inhabitants and take them over. The Kaiju are genetically created with the sole purpose of eliminating human populations so that the Precursors can easily take over Earth. Furthermore, Newton's mind-meld with the Kaiju brain reveals that when a Kaiju is killed, the Precursors study the way it was defeated and then use that information to engineer the next generation of Kaiju, making them even more formidable. This explains why the category of Kaiju increases and why their attacks become more brutal and frequent. As the movie progresses, Newton and Hannibal eventually begin to work together, putting aside their differences, and combining their unique skill sets in order to come up with a viable solution. They theorize that the only way to end the threat once and for all is to close the interdimensional fissure and prevent any more Kaiju from entering our world. To achieve that, they figure out that a nuclear payload would need to be sent to the other side of the fissure to destabilize it, causing it to collapse and cut off the passage between the two dimensions. In conclusion, Newton and Hannibal discover the true nature, purpose, and origin of the Kaiju attacks, as well as the key to stopping the invasion. By working together, they devise a plan that ultimately leads to the closure of the interdimensional fissure and the end of the Kaiju threat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The couple had ventured to the coast for a much-needed day of relaxation and was enamored by the stunning beauty of the cliffs that towered above them. With thoughts of their unborn child brought forth, they marveled at the majestic seascapes that surrounded them. Little did they know, the very same waters that lulled them into a sense of security would quickly ensnare them in a life-threatening predicament As the tide rushed in, the water began encroaching upon their sandy refuge. At first, they dismissed its progress as natural and inevitable. However, with every passing moment, the rising waters threatened to entrap them at the base of the cliffs with no means of escape.

The Finnish phrase \\"Useat ihmiset ovat saaneet surmansa.\\" can be broken down as follows: - 'Useat' means 'several' or 'many'. It's a pronoun that is used to refer to an indefinite quantity of something. More specifically, 'useat' refers to a large number that is more than two but doesn't specify the exact number.  - 'Ihmiset' means 'people'. It's the plural form of 'ihminen', which translates to 'person'. Finnish uses the same plural form regardless of the gender of the people being referred to. - 'Ovat saaneet surmansa.' translates to 'have lost their lives.' It's a verb phrase in the past tense.   - 'Ovat' is the third person plural present tense of the verb \\"olla\\", meaning \\"to be\\". In this context, it's used as a helper verb to form the perfect tense.      - 'Saaneet' is the past participle of 'saada', which means 'to get' or 'to receive'. In this context, it's used in combination with 'ovat' to form the perfect tense.      - 'Surmansa' is a possessive form of 'surma', which means 'death'. The '-nsa' ending indicates that the death belongs to the 'useat ihmiset' (several people). So, \\"Useat ihmiset ovat saaneet surmansa.\\" is basically stating that a large, but unspecified, number of people have lost their lives or died. This phrase is usually used in the context of discussing accidents or incidents where multiple fatalities were caused.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Were Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane both poets? Answer:","output":"While both Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane were renowned literary figures, they possessed different areas of expertise within the literary domain. To understand whether they can both be classified as poets, we must first delve into their unique backgrounds and literary contributions. Natalia Ginzburg (1916-1991) was an Italian author, whose works spanned across various genres, including novels, essays, and short stories. Born in Palermo, Italy, she began her writing career in her early twenties, contributing short stories to journals and publications. However, the majority of her work revolves around fiction and non-fiction prose, rather than poetry. Ginzburg is best known for her novels and essays, which offer an exceptional portrayal of Italian society and family dynamics across different periods, including World War II and the post-war era. Some of her most prominent works include \\"The Dry Heart\\" (1947), \\"Family Sayings\\" (1963), and \\"No Way\\" (1973). While Ginzburg's writing speaks volumes about human relationships and emotions, her focus has predominantly been on prose, as opposed to poetry. Hart Crane (1899-1932), on the other hand, was an American poet celebrated for his innovative style and the depth of his imagery. Born in Garrettsville, Ohio, Crane's writing journey began at a young age, with his first poem published when he was only 17 years old. Despite facing numerous personal challenges throughout his life, Crane remains an influential figure in modern American poetry. His work is characterized by strong symbolism, dense metaphors, and audacious wordplay. Crane's poetic achievements reached their pinnacle with his book-length poem, \\"The Bridge\\" (1930), a work that blends inspiration from European and American sources and forms a vivid vision of the United States. Additionally, his earlier collection of poems, titled \\"White Buildings\\" (1926), voices the hope and despair of a generation dealing with rapid social and technological changes. In conclusion, Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane were both highly acclaimed and deeply influential figures in the literary world. While Ginzburg masterfully crafted intriguing stories and essays around human relationships and Italian society, it was Crane who dedicated his talents to poetry, producing thought-provoking and innovative works. Therefore, we can assert that Hart Crane was unquestionably a poet, but Natalia Ginzburg, despite her many literary accomplishments, was not primarily a poet. Instead, she should be appreciated and remembered for her remarkable contributions to the realms of fiction and non-fiction prose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Look for healthy, sturdy trees and avoid trees that are young and thin. Try to find 2 trees that are spaced apart the same distance as the length of your hammock.","output":"After finding two sturdy and well-spaced trees, the next logical step in putting up a hammock is to attach suspension straps or ropes to the trees and secure the hammock to these attachments. Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Choose appropriate suspension straps or ropes: Select a suspension system that suits your needs. There are various types available, including tree-friendly straps, polyester ropes, and nylon webbing. Tree-friendly straps are highly recommended since they are not only strong but also protect the trees from being damaged. 2. Determine the right height: Before hanging your hammock, consider the desired height from the ground. Generally, the suspension straps should be placed about four to six feet above the ground, but it might vary based on your comfort preference, type of hammock, and individual requirements. 3. Attach suspension straps to the trees: Take one end of the suspension strap or rope and wrap it around the first tree at the determined height. Make sure it's tight and secure. You can either tie a strong knot, like a bowline knot or a figure-eight knot, or use a carabiner if your straps have built-in loops. Repeat this process for the second tree as well. 4. Measure sag: A good hammock hanging angle is crucial for comfort and stability. Aim for a 30-degree angle between the suspension system and the ground. To achieve this, imagine extending the strap towards the ground to create an equilateral triangle. Adjust the straps accordingly to achieve the desired sag. 5. Attach your hammock: Now, take your hammock and attach it to the suspension straps on both ends. You can use carabiners or S-hooks, depending on your hammock's design and suspension system. Ensure the connections are secure and that your hammock is hanging evenly on both sides.  6. Test the stability: Gently apply pressure to the hammock to test its stability and ensure it is secure. If the suspension is loose or the hammock hangs too low, adjust the straps as needed. You want the hammock to hold your weight without touching the ground or feeling unstable. 7. Fine-tune your hanging: Once you've confirmed your hammock's stability, you can fine-tune your setup. Adjust the tension and height as necessary to achieve a comfortable position that suits your preference. Make sure there's enough tension for support, while still allowing for a comfortable amount of sag. 8. Double-check your knots and connections: Before finally relaxing in your hammock, give the knots and connections one last check to make sure everything is safe and secure. Following these steps will allow you to comfortably and safely set up your hammock in the perfect location you've found between the two sturdy trees.

Create a list containing the strings: \`\`\`python string_list = ['a', 'h', 'reserved,', 'y', 'of', 's', 'well', 'F'] \`\`\` 2. Use the join() method to concatenate the list of strings: \`\`\`python concatenated_string = ''.join(string_list) \`\`\` In this step, we use an empty string ('') as a separator, meaning there will be no additional separator between the elements when they are concatenated. 3. Print the concatenated string: \`\`\`python print(concatenated_string) \`\`\` 4. The complete Python code looks like this: \`\`\`python string_list = ['a', 'h', 'reserved,', 'y', 'of', 's', 'well', 'F'] concatenated_string = ''.join(string_list) print(concatenated_string) \`\`\` 5. When you run the code, you will get the following output: \`\`\` ahreserved,yofswellF \`\`\` So, the solution to the problem is the concatenated string 'ahreserved,yofswellF'."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s?  Despite the steep decline in Watts's popularity, Hope continued to hold a place in popular culture, and there remained those who considered it a major work. When the Tate Gallery held an exhibition of its Watts holdings in 1954, trade unionist and left-wing M.P. Percy Collick urged \\"Labour stalwarts\\" to attend the exhibition, supposedly privately recounting that he had recently met a Viennese Jewish woman who during \\"the terrors of the Nazi War\\" had drawn \\"renewed faith and hope\\" from her photographic copy. Meanwhile, an influential 1959 sermon by Martin Luther King Jr., now known as Shattered Dreams, took Hope as a symbol of frustrated ambition and the knowledge that few people live to see their wishes fulfilled, arguing that \\"shattered dreams are a hallmark of our mortal life\\", and against retreating into either apathetic cynicism, a fatalistic belief in God's will or escapist fantasy in response to failure.Myths continued to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem from the fact that in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim for which there is no evidence.In 1990 Barack Obama, at the time a student at Harvard Law School, attended a sermon at the Trinity United Church of Christ preached by Jeremiah Wright. Taking the Books of Samuel as a starting point, Wright explained that he had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s (Sampson described it as \\"a study in contradictions\\"), before discussing the image's significance in the modern world. The answer is:","output":"Jeremiah Wright. The task involves carefully reading through the paragraph and extracting the answer for a specific question.

Why does the government issue 1RS note and not RBI? OPT:  * no;  * yes;","output":"Yes, these two questions essentially have the same meaning as they both address the same topic regarding the unique situation where the one-rupee note in India is issued by the Government of India, while other denominations are issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Let's explore this matter in greater detail. In India, the issuance of currency notes is governed by the Reserve Bank of India Act of 1934 and the Indian Coinage Act of 2011. According to the RBI Act, the central bank is responsible for the issue and management of currency in the country, and this authority extends to the design, issuance, and withdrawal of most of the currency notes. However, the one-rupee note is an exception to this general rule, as it falls under the ambit of the Indian Coinage Act, which regulates the issuance of coins and one-rupee notes by the Government of India. This unique distinction can be attributed to historical reasons and the legislative framework that governs currency management in the country. The difference in responsibility can be traced back to British India's currency management system, which the RBI Act largely inherited. Under the British system, the issuing of notes higher than one rupee was the responsibility of the Controller of the Currency, but the issuance of coins and one-rupee notes was the responsibility of the Government of India, under the Indian Coinage Act. This distinction continued even after India became an independent nation and established the RBI. There are a few practical differences between one-rupee notes and other denominations as a result of this arrangement: 1. Signature: One-rupee notes bear the signature of the Finance Secretary of India, while other denomination notes carry the signature of the Governor of the RBI. 2. Design and language panel: One-rupee notes have a slightly different design pattern, with the Government of India monogram placed prominently, and the denomination mentioned in 15 languages in the language panel, while other denominations display the RBI's emblem and mention the denomination in 17 languages. 3. Legal tender status: Both one-rupee notes and other currency notes have the same legal tender status, meaning that they are universally accepted for payment within the country. In conclusion, the two questions inquired about the division of responsibility between the Government of India and the RBI in issuing the one-rupee note and other denominations of currency. The reasons behind this division can be attributed to the historical context and the legal framework that governs currency management in India. Although these questions are distinct in their phrasing, they essentially convey the same intent and concern, hence invoking a \\"yes\\" in terms of having the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for  35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped  signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \\" rainbow apple\\", a rainbow- colored silhouette    of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926.

Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack.

However, if you want to pair your sweater with a dress, skirt, shorts, and any other shorter garments worn on your bottom half, you probably want a slouchy sweater that still ends around the waist. If you’re going to be wearing an oversized sweater as a dress, you definitely want something long that covers you! Oversized sweaters go in and out of fashion, but when they are very stylish, in both men's and women's departments -don't be afraid to explore both sections – oversized sweaters are a fantastic, gender neutral wardrobe pieces. Make sure you also know that a more baggy sweater will go with more tighter bottoms then if you were to wear a tight sweater then you would wear baggy bottoms. Monochrome sweaters, especially those in neutral colors, are great additions to your wardrobe because they can be paired with all sorts of other clothes and accessories. Patterned sweaters can be fun statement pieces, and you can effortlessly create an outfit just by pairing them with neutral trousers, leggings, shorts etc. There is a time and a place for both bold patterns and solid neutrals. Consider your collection of pants, jeans, skirts, leggings, dresses, and so on when deciding which kind of sweater to add to your collection. This will help you decide if you want a thick, chunky sweater, or a more lightweight sweater. If you’re looking for a sweater to wear over layers, you may want to get something a bit less chunky – otherwise, you’ll feel like you’re wearing a sumo suit. On the other side, you don’t want something so sheer that you’ll see the bottom layers right through it. Lightweight, oversized cardigans are great to throw on over warm weather outfits, and big chunky sweaters look great with winter outfits. It’s all about visualizing the outfits you want to create!

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Just seven years ago, the Jarvik-7 artificial heart was being cheered as the model of human creativeness. The sight of Barney Clark----alive and conscious after trading his diseased heart for a metal-and-plastic pump----convinced the press, the public and many doctors that the future had arrived. It hadn't. After monitoring production of the Jarvik-7, and reviewing its effects on the 150 or so patients (most of whom got the device as a temporary measure) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that the machine was doing more to endanger lives than to save them. Last week the agency cancelled its earlier approval, effectively banning   the device. The recall may hurt Symbion Inc., maker of the Jarvik-7, but it won't end the request for an artificial heart. One problem with the banned mode is that the tubes connecting it to an external power source created a passage for infection.

Output:","output":"چون هوا هنوز خیلی پر از آشغال بود. Explanation: Here is the breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Because\\" = \\"چون\\". This term indicates a reason or cause in Persian, similar to its usage in English. 2. \\"The air\\" = \\"هوا\\". It is the Persian equivalent of the English term \\"air\\". 3. \\"Was still\\" = \\"هنوز\\". The Persian word for \\"still\\" represents the continuation of a state or condition. 4. \\"Very\\" = \\"خیلی\\". This word is used to amplify the degree of an adjective or adverb in Persian, just like in English. 5. \\"Thick\\" = \\"پر\\". In this context, \\"thick\\" is metaphorically translated as \\"پر\\" in Persian, which literally means \\"full\\". It is commonly used to convey a high density or abundance of something. 6. \\"With debris\\" = \\"از آشغال\\". The preposition \\"with\\" is translated as \\"از\\" and \\"debris\\" is translated as \\"آشغال\\". The term \\"آشغال\\" is used in Persian to refer to waste materials or garbage, similar to \\"debris\\" in English.

If She could not be implicated ”otherwise I should have heard some hint of it. , can we conclude that \\"I heard that she has been implicated.\\"?","output":"To determine if we can conclude that \\"I heard that she has been implicated,\\" let's break down the task step by step: 1. Understand the original statement: \\"If She could not be implicated otherwise I should have heard some hint of it.\\" This statement implies that if it were possible for her to be implicated, the speaker would have likely heard a hint or some information suggesting the implication. 2. Analyze the sentence structure and meaning: The sentence structure is a conditional statement. It asserts that the speaker would hear information (\\"some hint of it\\") if the condition (she could be implicated) were met. 3. Consider the negation of the statement: The negation of the original statement would be that \\"if she could be implicated, then I have not heard any hint of it.\\" However, this negation cannot be directly inferred from the original statement. 4. Apply logical reasoning: If the speaker says they have not heard any hint of her implication (if there was any), it means there is a lack of information related to her implication. Therefore, it is not valid to conclude that \\"I heard she has been implicated\\" as the speaker has not received any such evidence. In conclusion, we cannot deduce that \\"I heard that she has been implicated\\" from the given statement.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Angling is a method of fishing by means of an \\"angle\\" (fish hook). The hook is usually attached to a fishing line and the line is often attached to a fishing rod. Fishing rods are usually fitted with a fishing reel that functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. The hook itself can be dressed with lures or bait. A bite indicator such as a float, and a weight or sinker are sometimes used.  - The common carp or European carp (\\"Cyprinus carpio\\") is a widespread freshwater fish of eutrophic waters in lakes and large rivers in Europe and Asia. The native wild populations are considered vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN, but the species has also been domesticated and introduced into environments worldwide, and is often considered a destructive invasive species, being included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive species. It gives its name to the carp family Cyprinidae.  - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - A fishing reel is a cylindrical device attached to a fishing rod used in winding and stowing line.  - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.  - A fish hook or fishhook is a device for catching fish either by impaling them in the mouth or, more rarely, by snagging the body of the fish. Fish hooks have been employed for centuries by fishermen to catch fresh and saltwater fish. In 2005, the fish hook was chosen by \\"Forbes\\" as one of the top twenty tools in the history of man. Fish hooks are normally attached to some form of line or lure device which connects the caught fish to the fisherman. There is an enormous variety of fish hooks in the world of fishing. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the fish hook. Fish hooks are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. Fish hooks are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey (fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey (lure fishing).  History. The fish hook or similar device has been made by man for many thousands of years. Neolithic fish hooks have been recorded from Palestine about 7000 BC. In 2011, archaeologists in the Jerimalai cave in East Timor discovered what was then the world's oldest fish hook, a shell hook between 16,000 and 23,000 years old.However finds also made from sea snails some 23,000 years ago and predating the East Timor finds were reported from Okinawa. An early written reference to a fish hook is found with reference to the Leviathan in the Book of Job 41:1; \\"Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?\\" Fish hooks have been crafted from all sorts of materials including wood, animal and human bone, horn, shells, stone, bronze, iron up to present day materials. In many cases, hooks were created from multiple materials to leverage the strength and positive characteristics of each material. Norwegians as late as the 1950s still used juniper wood to craft Burbot hooks. Quality steel hooks began to make...  - A fishing line is a cord used or made for angling. Important parameters of a fishing line are its length, material, and weight (thicker lines are more visible to fish). Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include breaking strength, knot strength, UV resistance, castability, limpness, stretch, abrasion resistance, and visibility. Most modern lines are made from nylon or silk.  - The Cyprinidae are the family of freshwater fishes, collectively called cyprinids, that includes the carps, the true minnows, and their relatives (for example, the barbs and barbels). Also commonly called the \\"carp family\\", or \\"minnow family\\", Cyprinidae is the largest known fish family and the largest vertebrate animal family in general, with about 3,000 living and extinct species in about 370 genera. The family belongs to the ostariophysian order Cypriniformes, of whose genera and species the cyprinids make more than two-thirds. The family name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"kyprînos\\" (, \\"carp\\").  - A fishing rod is a long, flexible rod used to catch fish. At its simplest, a fishing rod is a simple stick or pole attached to a line ending in a hook (formerly known as an \\"angle\\", hence the term angling). The length of the rod can vary between . To entice fish, bait or lures are impaled on one or more hooks attached to the line. The line is generally stored on a reel which reduces tangles and assists in landing a fish.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Carp are various species of oily freshwater fish from the family Cyprinidae, a very large group of fish native to Europe and Asia.  - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Angler's Mail is a weekly angling magazine published in London, UK, by IPC Media's Inspire division.   - Benson ( 1984 -- 4 August 2009 ) was \`\` Britain 's biggest and best - loved '' common carp . Benson 's popularity was such that she was caught 63 times in 13 years , although the accessibility that made her popular was also the cause of controversy among angling 's elite . She has also been referred to as \`\` the people 's fish '' and was voted by readers of Angler 's Mail as Britain 's Favourite Carp in 2005 . The fish , who was female , was originally one of a pair : her original companion , Hedges , disappeared in a flood of the River Nene in 1998 . Both fish were named due to a hole in Benson 's dorsal fin that resembled a cigarette burn , in a reference to Benson and Hedges . At her peak weight , in 2006 , she weighed 64 pounds and 2 ounces ( 29 kg ) . Benson died on 4 August 2009 , aged 25 . At the time of her death , she weighed the same as a large dog and was worth £ 20,000 . The owner of the lake where she lived alleged that she was accidentally poisoned by anglers using uncooked tigernuts as bait , though evidence points to the contrary ( see section on death below ) .

Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.  The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution.

With which song did Clodagh Rogers represent the UK in the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest?","output":"Clodagh Rodgers represented the United Kingdom in the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Jack in the Box.\\" The contest took place in Dublin, Ireland, on April 3, 1971, and it was the 16th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. The song was penned by renowned British songwriters John Worsley and David Myers. \\"Jack in the Box\\" is an upbeat, cheerful, and catchy pop song that stood out for its catchy melody and Clodagh's dynamic stage presence. Clodagh Rodgers, born on March 5, 1947, is a Northern Irish singer who gained significant popularity during the late 1960s and 1970s. Her charming personality, as well as her ability to engage the audience, contributed greatly to the success of her performance at the Eurovision contest. The 1971 Eurovision Song Contest featured 18 countries, and it was the second time the contest was hosted in Ireland. The event was held at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, which is known for its long-standing contribution to the Irish art scene. Clodagh Rodgers' \\"Jack in the Box\\" received 98 points, resulting in a respectable but not winning 4th place. The winner of that year's contest was Monaco with the song \\"Un Banc, Un Arbre, Une Rue,\\" performed by Séverine. Clodagh Rodgers' participation in Eurovision managed to boost her career in the United Kingdom. Following the contest, \\"Jack in the Box\\" was released as a single.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... Question: After the study medical professionals probably recommended that Options: - not enough information   - only the elderly take supplements   - only pregnant women take supplements   - only certain patients take supplements === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"only certain patients take supplements"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango.  Which fruit have a higher sugar content candied ginger or fresh apples?  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","output":"Candied ginger has a higher sugar content compared to fresh apples. The process of making candied fruit involves immersing the fruit in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from the fruit and preserves it. The fruit becomes saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure it creates. Therefore, while fresh apples do contain natural sugars, the added sugar from the preservation process gives candied ginger a higher overall sugar content."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: The main international airport is Douala International Airport and a second international airport at the Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport. Sentence 2: The main international airport is the Douala International Airport and a secondary international airport at Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport. Step 2: Analyze the main points of each sentence. Both sentences mention: - The main international airport is Douala International Airport. - There is another international airport, Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport. Step 3: Compare the structure and keywords used in the sentences. Both sentences utilize similar sentence structure. The main difference between the two is the use of \\"second\\" versus \\"secondary\\".  Step 4: Evaluate the meaning of the different words used. - \\"Second\\" generally refers to the second item in a given order. - \\"Secondary\\" refers to something of lesser importance or a backup to the primary item. Step 5: Determine if the sentences convey the same meaning. While both sentences are conveying very similar information, the slight difference in the use of \\"second\\" and \\"secondary\\" could lead to a minor difference in interpretation. \\"Second\\" implies it is simply the next one on a list, while \\"secondary\\" may imply it is of lesser importance compared to the main airport.

While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

Options: - farming community - rural area - cow's shed - michigan - housing farmer and family A:","output":"John lives in a rural area. This option makes the most sense given the information provided. The text states that he lives in a farmhouse that is well away from anyone else and that the farm shut down long ago. This suggests that his area would not be described as a farming community because no active farming is taking place. It wouldn't be described as a cow's shed because he lives in a farmhouse, not a shed for animals. Michigan cannot be assumed as there's no specific location information provided in the description. Lastly, the option of 'housing farmer and family' doesn't fit either, as we are told that John doesn't farm himself.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are the base or the top ):   Rich was examining a cliff face. Which part of the cliff is older, geologically speaking the base or the top? A:","output":"The base of the cliff would be older, geologically speaking. This concept is based on the law of superposition, a major principle in geology that was first proposed by the Danish geological pioneer Nicholas Steno (1638–1686). The law states that in any undisturbed sequence of rocks deposited in layers (strata), the youngest layer is on top and the oldest on the bottom, each layer being younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it.  The reasoning behind this principle is simple and straightforward. When sedimentary rocks are formed, new sediments are deposited on top of older layers. These sediments can come from various sources such as rivers, volcanoes, or wind-blown dust. Over time, these sediments can get buried and compacted under the weight of newer sediments, eventually transforming into sedimentary rock layers.  Therefore, starting from the base of a sedimentary sequence and moving upward, the materials become younger. When Rich examines a cliff face, the lowermost part of the cliff (the base) represents the earliest geological period, while the uppermost part of the cliff (the top) represents the latest or youngest geological period.  This method of reading rock layers is also utilized in relative dating. It helps scientists determine the sequence of geologic events in a particular area, even if they can't determine the absolute ages of the rocks.  So in summary, according to the law of superposition, the base of the cliff that Rich is examining would be older, geologically speaking, compared to the top. This is because over millions of years, newer sediment layers were deposited on top of older ones. So, the deeper you go into the ground or towards the base of a cliff or sequence, the further back in time you travel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","output":"Based on the content of the review, it seems like the overall tone of the product review is mixed rather than strictly negative. Let's break down the different elements of the review to understand this conclusion more thoroughly: 1. The title of the review, \\"cool toy,\\" gives a positive impression, suggesting that the reviewer found the toy to be interesting and enjoyable. 2. In the body of the review, the author mentions that their child likes the seat and loves the accompanying toy. This statement indicates that the child is enjoying the product and, by extension, the parent is happy or satisfied with the product's ability to meet their child's needs to some extent. 3. The review then proceeds to mention a negative aspect, describing how the child, who is very small, tends to fall over to one side when seated. This suggests that the product might not be perfectly suited for all children, particularly those of smaller stature. This issue has the potential to diminish the overall satisfaction with the product. Although there is a negative point mentioned in the review, the overall sentiment seems to be mixed as it includes both positive and negative aspects. The parent is happy with the fact that their child is enjoying the seat and the accompanying toy, but they also express concern regarding the product's fit and safety for their child.

Translate to English English:","output":"Recently, a research study found that the majority of Turks respect the separation of religion and state; however, 76% of them support the idea of allowing women to wear headscarves in universities. According to the results of a research study conducted a short while ago, a majority of Turkish people respect the separation of religion and state affairs. Nonetheless, a significant 76% of the respondents expressed their desire for headscarves, or turbans, to be permitted in university settings. This finding indicates that, while the Turkish population values the notion of distinct state and religious institutions, they also wish to secure individual freedom of expression when it comes to religious practices. In this case, the majority of Turks advocate for the right of women to wear headscarves as a part of their cultural and religious identity while attending higher education institutions. Headscarves represent an important aspect of Turkish culture and religion, particularly in the context of women's attire. Consequently, this display of support for allowing them in universities signals an inclination among the Turkish people toward inclusivity and acknowledgment of religious and cultural practices in public life. Furthermore, this majority viewpoint may demonstrate a balancing act between maintaining the essential separation of church and state while, at the same time, allowing for personal expressions of faith. This balance reflects a nuanced understanding of the coexistence of secular and religious elements in a diverse and democratic society. In summary, the research study reveals that while most Turks respect the division between religious and state matters, a significant proportion of them hope to accommodate the right to wear headscarves in universities. This stance speaks to a broader desire for acknowledging cultural and religious practices in public spaces while still upholding a secular framework for governing institutions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Neil refused to buy Benjamin a rabbit because","output":"he believed that Benjamin wasn't responsible enough to handle the duties associated with pet ownership. Despite Benjamin's begging and pleading, Neil remained firm in his decision. A rabbit, after all, required much care and attention; it wasn't a mere toy one could play with and then cast aside. Benjamin, however, was not one to give up so easily. He spent days researching about rabbit care, watching videos and reading up on articles to prove that he could, in fact, properly care for a pet rabbit. He approached Neil again armed with his newfound knowledge, confidently explaining all he had learned about rabbits to demonstrate his seriousness and commitment to the challenge. Neil was impressed with Benjamin's dedication but still had his reservations. To further convince his father, Benjamin decided to develop a detailed plan of how he would take care of the bunny. He listed down all the daily tasks such as feeding, cleaning the hutch, providing exercise, and grooming the rabbit. Additionally, he provided an estimated budget for everything associated with rabbit care, including the cost of purchasing the rabbit, the hutch, bedding, hay, food, toys, and veterinary expenses. Eventually, Neil agreed to give Benjamin a chance to prove his responsibility. But instead of buying him a rabbit outright, they decided to volunteer at a local animal shelter that housed rabbits. This would allow Benjamin to gain hands-on experience in rabbit care and provide Neil with reassurance that his son could handle the responsibility. For several weeks, Benjamin and Neil visited the animal shelter, devoting quality time to understanding the needs and concerns of the rabbits there. Benjamin learned how to feed the rabbits, clean their cages, groom their fur, and even handle basic health issues that might arise. Neil watched as his son developed a strong bond with the rabbits, understanding their behaviors, and genuinely caring for their well-being. During this time, Benjamin formed a connection with one rabbit in particular, a brown and white bunny named Sophie. He found that Sophie was playful and affectionate, traits that made him fall in love with her instantly. Benjamin knew that Sophie was the perfect rabbit companion he had been hoping for. Having seen the passion and dedication from his son, Neil finally felt confident in Benjamin's ability to care for a pet rabbit. He agreed that they could adopt Sophie, much to Benjamin's delight. They began to prepare their home, ensuring that Sophie would have a safe and comfortable environment full of love and care when she came to live with them. As the day of Sophie's adoption neared, Benjamin couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had successfully educated himself about rabbit care and proven his responsibility and dedication to his father. He understood that pet ownership was no easy task, and he was grateful for the chance to prove his worth. In the end, Neil was happy with the outcome of the story, not only because his son had learned about the importance of responsibility and commitment but also because they had both discovered a new love for rabbits – an unexpected but heartwarming addition to their family. As they welcomed Sophie home, both Benjamin and Neil knew that she would bring endless joy and happiness into their lives, making all their efforts worthwhile. Benjamin cared for Sophie diligently, lovingly fulfilling his promise to be a responsible pet owner. And in the process, Neil and Benjamin's bond only grew stronger. Their shared love for and commitment to Sophie created a newfound bond between father and son, one that would last for years to come as they continued to learn and grow together, forever changed by the delightful rabbit that had hopped her way into their hearts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Marcus is working with a sealed container of oxygen. He is trying see how temperature effects its deviations from ideality.  He slowly increases the temperature of the oxygen and continues to measures its deviations.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will increasing the pressure cause the expected volume be more or less?  Hint: The Figure below shows a graph of plotted against pressure for 1 mol of a gas at three different temperatures - 200 K, 500 K, and 1000 K. An ideal gas would have a value of 1 for that ratio at all temperatures and pressures and the graph would simply be a horizontal line. As can be seen, deviations from an ideal gas occur. As the pressure begins to rise, the attractive forces cause the volume of the gas to be less than expected and the value of drops under 1. Continued pressure increase results in the volume of the particles to become significant and the value of rises to greater than 1. Notice, that the magnitude of the deviations from ideality is greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K. Answer:","output":"As Marcus increases the temperature of the oxygen in the sealed container, its deviations from ideality will be affected. According to the given information in the paragraph and the figure, we can understand how the gas will behave under different temperatures and pressures. From the figure provided, we can see that the behavior of the gas changes as temperature affects its deviations from ideality. At lower temperatures (200 K), the attractive forces between the gas molecules play a more significant role, causing the volume of the gas to be less than expected, and hence the value of drops under 1. At higher temperatures (1000 K), these attractive forces are less significant, and the deviations from ideality are minimal. The graph shows that the deviations from ideality decrease as the temperature increases. Now, considering the effect of pressure on the expected volume of the gas, we can infer the following: When Marcus increases the pressure on the sealed container of oxygen, the attractive forces between the gas molecules will initially cause the expected volume to be less than that predicted for an ideal gas. The gas will deviate more from ideality and display a value of less than 1. However, as the pressure continues to increase, the volume occupied by the gas particles themselves will become significant, causing the expected volume to be more than predicted for an ideal gas, and the value of will rise to greater than 1. Since Marcus is gradually increasing the temperature of the oxygen, the deviations from ideality will decrease. This means that the gas will behave more like an ideal gas, and its response to increasing pressure will be less influenced by the attractive forces between the molecules and the volume occupied by the particles themselves. In conclusion, as Marcus increases the temperature of the sealed container of oxygen while also increasing pressure, the expected volume will initially be less. However, at higher temperatures and continued pressure increase, the effect on the expected volume will be minimal, causing it to approach the values of an ideal gas. The magnitude of the deviations from ideality will be greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step in the process of the greenhouse effect, which leads to the warming of the Earth, involves the emission of greenhouse gases from various sources. These sources can be both natural and human-induced. Natural sources include volcanic activity, decomposition of organic matter, and the respiration of living organisms. Human-induced sources mainly consist of burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. When the sun's light reaches the Earth, it is either absorbed or reflected back into space. The absorbed sunlight heats up the Earth's surface, which then radiates heat energy in the form of infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, present in the Earth's atmosphere, trap some of this radiated heat and prevent it from escaping back into space, thus keeping the Earth warm. This trapped heat creates a natural \\"greenhouse effect,\\" which is essential for maintaining the Earth's temperature and supporting life. However, increasing levels of greenhouse gases due to human activities have enhanced the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change. The Earth's temperature continues to rise, causing various environmental and ecological consequences, such as extreme weather events, melting ice caps, and rising sea levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Understand the premise and hypothesis. The premise states that the war criminal is treated no worse than his friends. It implies that the treatment or conditions given to the war criminal are at least as good as the treatment received by his friends. The hypothesis suggests that the war criminal got a fancy jail cell. It describes a potentially better or more privileged condition for the war criminal.

Thus, it is impossible to determine if the hypothesis is true based solely on the information provided in the premise. We need more information about the treatment or conditions his friends receive.

Pleased with Andrea's ability to \\"follow my mind and keep his eyes fixed on the ultimate goal,\\" Borgia selects Andrea to accomplish an intrigue: arrange the marriage of his widowed sister, Lucrezia (whose husband he has just had assassinated for the purpose), to Alfonso d'Este, the son of the Duke Ercole d'Este of Ferrara. By doing so, Borgia will remove Ferrara as an impediment to conquest of central Italy. In being selected, however, Andrea earns the enmity of Don Esteban Ramirez (Leslie Bradley), an ambitious mercenary captain and rival. Andrea travels to Venice to sell some of his paintings to raise money for expenses. He meets the lovely Camilla di la Baglione (Wanda Hendrix), young wife of the elderly Count Marc Antonio Verano of Citta del Monte, and smitten with her, gallantly gives her a painting he was haggling to sell for a hundred ducats. Soon after, an assassin attempts to kill Andrea, but he thwarts the attack and spares the assassin to learn who hired him: the Duke Ercole d'Este. He hires the assassin, Mario Belli (Everett Sloane), as part of his own entourage. Resuming the mission, Andrea stops to visit the farm of a blacksmith's widow, reputed to be hiding gold stolen by her bandit son. She is actually his mother (Katina Paxinou), and he is in fact Andrea Zoppo, not the noble Orsini he pretends to be. The reunion is a rocky one, because the mother does not approve of her son's evil ways. Belli spies on them through a window. Andrea continues to Ferrara, where he succeeds in arranging the marriage by intimidating the duke and flattering Alfonso.

To begin with, the premise provides information about an individual's swimming skills. It clearly establishes that the person in question is not a swimmer. This means that any hypothesis that suggests this person is not a swimmer aligns with the given premise. However, the second part of the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information about the individual, i.e., \\"I am black.\\" The premise does not mention the individual's race, skin color or ethnicity. The only characteristics the premise gives about this person pertains to their swimming abilities. Therefore, this part of the hypothesis does not align with the premise because they do not address the same aspects of this individual's identity or abilities. In light of this discrepancy, it is impossible to ascertain the veracity of this part of the hypothesis based on the given premise alone. The third part of the hypothesis, \\"so alright\\" is a statement of agreement or acceptance by the individual. This is similar to the premise where the individual affirmed, \\"I said okay\\". However, without additional context, it is unclear what this confirmation is related to.

Possible A: eternal, religious, unpredictable, holy, monastic  Why is \\"unpredictable\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?

Step 1: Analyze the given question. In the question, James has a preference for a secular upbringing for the AI. This indicates that he has concerns about the potential consequences of a non-secular upbringing. Step 2: Assess the possible answers in relation to the question. Going through the options, the other choices - eternal, religious, holy, and monastic - mostly relate to religious or spiritual aspects, which can be associated with a non-secular upbringing.

If you have a neutral skin tone, any shade will probably look good.  For warm tones, dark browns, warm browns, chestnuts, rich golden browns, auburn, warm gold and red highlights, and golden blonde shades will look best on you. Go for colors with a red orange or gold base; those will look good on you. Avoid blue, violet, and ash based hair colors which will wash out your skin color. For cool tones, try shiny raven-wing blacks, cool ash browns, or cool blondes in shades ranging from mink to platinum and icy white. Avoid gold, yellow, red, and bronze tones in hair color. These warm tones have a tendency to make you look washed-out. You also may be able to wear many exciting bold, unnatural hair colors like lipstick red, cherry red, blue, and burgundies. Do you have light, medium, or dark skin? This is important when determining what color hair is right for you.  With paler skin, lighter shades work. For light skin and warm tones, try butterscotch, strawberry blonde, or honey. For light skin and cool tones, try platinum, flaxen, or champagne blonde. Medium skin provides more versatility. Medium skin and warm tones can go tawny blonde, golden caramel, or copper. Cool tones with medium skin should try ashy tones, such as sand, wheat blonde, and walnut brown. Olive skin looks great with rich browns or earthy shades. Cool tones should try auburn or cinnamon, while warm tones can go with ebony brown and mocha. For dark skin and cool tones, go for espresso and inky black. For dark skin and warm tones, try maple brown, mahogany, or toffee. Eye color can determine whether a hair color looks good on your or not. Do you want your eyes to pop? Green and blue eyes might look great with reds, brown, or blonde, while dark eyes might look great with a contrasting color. The extent to which you want to change your hair color impacts your choices. Do you want to keep your hair looking natural? Or do you want to go completely opposite? Do you want to get a bold, unnatural color? Decide what is best for you and your life.  If you want to go natural, only go 2-3 shades lighter or darker than your natural hair color.   Choose a color that will look good on you. Maybe you've always liked red hair, but is it right for you? If you love blue but have warm toned skin, consider another drastic, bold color. If you are unsure about a color, try temporary dyes. Permanent and semi-permanent dyes are more long-lasting if you want color that will stick around for awhile.  Permanent hair color won't wash out and will allow you to go lighter. Going lighter will probably require bleach. It's harder to reverse permanent dye, and you will have to retouch the roots as your hair grows. Semi-permanent hair color fades away with washes. It's great for highlighting, changing color tones in hair, adding depth, and covering grey. It cannot lighten the hair significantly. Temporary hair color washes out within 25-30 washes. It's good for adding shiny, vibrant colors to hair in a darker or brighter color. It also allows you to change your hair tone. They can't lighten your hair. Before you get a drastic makeover, decide why you are doing this. Are you following a trend? Have you recently had a traumatic experience, like a death in the family or a break up? Making drastic style choices based on emotions is not the best way to choose a style. Many websites will allow you to put different hairstyles onto a picture to see which you look best with. Others allow you to input your hair and style preferences to determine the right color for you. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To choose the best hair color for you, first determine your skin tone (neutral, warm, or cool) and skin shade (light, medium, or dark). Warm tones suit colors with red, orange, or gold bases, while cool tones work best with cool, ash-based shades. Lighter shades usually work well with pale skin, medium shades for medium skin, and darker or richer tones for dark and olive skin. Consider your eye color and whether you want a natural or bold look. Experiment with temporary dyes if unsure, and choose between permanent or semi-permanent options based on your desired level of commitment.

She has two siblings: older brother Chad is a business entrepreneur, and twin brother (12 minutes older) Wade is a musician. Her father is of French and Irish descent and her mother has Hungarian ancestry. On November 20, 2011, Morissette appeared at the American Music Awards. When asked about the new album during a short interview, she said she had recorded thirty-one songs, and that the album would \\"likely be out next year, probably [in] summertime\\". On December 21, 2011, Morissette performed a duet of \\"Uninvited\\" with finalist Josh Krajcik during the performance finale of the X-Factor.  Morissette embarked on a European tour for the summer of 2012, according to Alanis.com. In early May 2012, a new song called \\"Magical Child\\" appeared on a Starbucks compilation called Every Mother Counts.  On May 2, 2012, Morissette revealed through her Facebook account that her eighth studio album, entitled Havoc and Bright Lights, would be released in August 2012, on new label \\"Collective Sounds\\", distributed by Sony's RED Distribution. On the same day, Billboard specified the date as August 28 and revealed the album would contain twelve tracks.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who replaces the movie's lead female villain? , can you please find it?   The My Scene girls are attending high school in Manhattan when they find out there's a new teen spy movie called \\"Spy Society\\" being filmed there, starring Lindsay Lohan (who plays Mariel St. Clair, the lead character) and fictional character Ryan Ridley (who plays Lohan's love interest in the movie). While the girls, Barbie, Chelsea, Madison, Nolee, and Delancey, go to watch it being filmed, they get the idea to sneak into the film by pretending to be extras. While working as extras for the movie, the girls quickly learn that there's actually a lot of work that goes into making a movie, such as getting to the set really early in the morning, doing hours and hours of takes on a scene, and Chelsea keeps getting terrible roles such as towel girl, trash girl and even being forced to clean up after the horses that are being used in the movie. The girls imagine themselves becoming best friends with Lindsay Lohan, who turns out to be really nice and down-to-earth (and who they do end up becoming friends with). When one of the actresses on the set gets hurt and is unable to play her part, Madison's called in to take her place. The actress she's replacing plays the movie's lead female villain, although the character only has five speaking lines After a while, the fame starts going to Madison's head.

Ai spent her childhood in both Kagoshima, Japan and Los Angeles. She debuted as a singer in 2000, later moving to Def Jam Japan and rising to fame with her album 2004 Ai. Context: Ai was born in Los Angeles in 1981. Her father was Japanese and her mother was half Italian-American and half Japanese. She moved to Kagoshima in Japan when she was 4, and went to elementary school and junior high school in Japan.  Ai was motivated to become a singer in her early teens, after singing at a cousin's wedding, having many people ask her if she wanted to be a professional singer, and hearing a gospel performance at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles in 1993. After graduating from junior high school in Japan, Ai returned to Los Angeles for high school, enrolling at Glendale High School, however found high school difficult due to never formally studying English. After making it through the audition process, she switched to the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, majoring in ballet. She became a member of the school's gospel choir.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - In biological anatomy , commonly referred to as the mouth , under formal names such as the oral cavity , buccal cavity , or in Latin cavum oris , is the opening through which many animals take in food and issue vocal sounds . It is also the cavity lying at the upper end of the alimentary canal , bounded on the outside by the lips and inside by the pharynx and containing in higher vertebrates the tongue and teeth . This cavity is also known as the buccal cavity , from the Latin bucca ( \`\` cheek '' ) . Some animal phyla , including vertebrates , have a complete digestive system , with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other . Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify animals into protostome and deuterostome .  - Swallowing, sometimes called deglutition in scientific contexts, is the process in the human or animal body that makes something pass from the mouth, to the pharynx, and into the esophagus, while shutting the epiglottis. Swallowing is an important part of eating and drinking. If the process fails and the material (such as food, drink, or medicine) goes through the trachea, then choking or pulmonary aspiration can occur. In the human body the automatic temporary closing of the epiglottis is controlled by the swallowing reflex.  - Cheeks constitute the area of the face below the eyes and between the nose and the left or right ear. \\"Buccal\\" means relating to the cheek. In humans, the region is innervated by the buccal nerve. The area between the inside of the cheek and the teeth and gums is called the vestibule or buccal pouch or buccal cavity and forms part of the mouth. In other animals the cheeks may also be referred to as jowls.  - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.  - Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system.  - Saliva is a watery substance formed in the mouths of animals, secreted by the salivary glands. Human saliva comprises 99.5% mostly water, plus electrolytes, mucus, white blood cells, epithelial cells (which can be used to extract DNA), glycoproteins, enzymes (such as amylase and lipase), antimicrobial agents such as secretory IgA and lysozyme. The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats. These enzymes also play a role in breaking down food particles entrapped within dental crevices, thus protecting teeth from bacterial decay. Furthermore, saliva serves a lubricative function, wetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing, and protecting the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity from desiccation.  - The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word \\"vascular\\", meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin \\"vas\\", meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled.  - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.  - Mastication or chewing is the process by which food is crushed and ground by teeth. It is the first step of digestion, and it increases the surface area of foods to allow more efficient break down by enzymes. During the mastication process, the food is positioned by the cheek and tongue between the teeth for grinding. The muscles of mastication move the jaws to bring the teeth into intermittent contact, repeatedly occluding and opening. As chewing continues, the food is made softer and warmer, and the enzymes in saliva begin to break down carbohydrates in the food. After chewing, the food (now called a bolus) is swallowed. It enters the esophagus and via peristalsis continues on to the stomach, where the next step of digestion occurs.  - The nasal cavity (or nasal fossa) is a large air filled space above and behind the nose in the middle of the face. Each cavity is the continuation of one of the two nostrils.  - Taste buds contain the taste receptor cells, which are also known as gustatory cells. The taste receptors are located around the small structures known as papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus, the cheek and epiglottis. These structures are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception: salty, sour, bitter, sweet and umami; through the combination of these elements we detect \\"flavors.\\" A popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue. Via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with the taste receptors. These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds. The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves.  - The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three partsthe outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word \\"ear\\" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.  - The pharynx (plural: pharynges) is the part of the throat that is behind the mouth and nasal cavity and above the oesophagus and the larynx, or the tubes going down to the stomach and the lungs. The pharynx is an organ found in vertebrates and invertebrates, though the structure is not universally the same across all of those species.   - A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (nerve fibers, the long and slender projections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs.  - The buccal nerve (long buccal nerve) is a nerve in the face. It is a branch of the mandibular nerve (which is itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve) and transmits sensory information from skin over the buccal membrane (in general, the cheek) and from the second and third molar teeth. Not to be confused with the buccal branch of the facial nerve which transmits motor information to the buccinator muscle.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - The larynx (plural larynges; from the Greek  \\"lárynx\\"), commonly called the voice box, is an organ in the neck of tetrapods involved in breathing, sound production, and protecting the trachea against food aspiration. It manipulates pitch and volume. The larynx houses the vocal cords, which are essential for phonation. They are situated just below where the tract of the pharynx splits into the trachea and the esophagus.  - In vertebrate anatomy, the throat is the anterior part of the neck, positioned in front of the vertebra. It contains the pharynx and larynx. An important section of it is the epiglottis, which is a flap separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe) preventing food and drink being inhaled into the lungs. The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords. Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle. The \\"throat\\" is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the isthmus of the fauces.  - The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of most vertebrates that manipulates food for mastication, and is used in the act of swallowing. It is of importance in the digestive system and is the primary organ of taste in the gustatory system. The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered in taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals.  - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.  - Speech is the vocalized form of communication based upon the syntactic combination of lexicals and names that are drawn from very large (usually about 1,000 different words) vocabularies. Each spoken word is created out of the phonetic combination of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech sound units (phonemes). These vocabularies, the syntax which structures them, and their sets of speech sound units differ, creating many thousands of different, and mutually unintelligible, human languages. Most human speakers are able to communicate in two or more of them, hence being polyglots. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also enable them to sing.  - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).  - Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.  - The face is a central organ of sense and is also very central in the expression of emotion among humans and among numerous other species. The face is normally found on the anterior (\\"frontal\\", \\"rostral\\") surface of the head of animals or humans, although not all animals have faces. The face is crucial for human identity, and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities have effects stretching beyond those of solely physical inconvenience.  - The esophagus (American English) or oesophagus (British English) (/sfs/), commonly known as the food pipe or gullet, is an organ in vertebrates through which food passes, aided by peristaltic contractions, from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is a fibromuscular tube, about 25 centimetres long in adults, which travels behind the trachea and heart, passes through the diaphragm and empties into the uppermost region of the stomach. During swallowing, the epiglottis tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx and lungs. The word \\"esophagus\\" is the Greek word for \\"gullet\\".

And the answer is...","output":"To solve for m in the equation -192 = -125m + 93m, we first combine like terms on the right side of the equation. -125m and 93m are like terms because they both contain the variable m. So let's subtract 93m from -125m. -125m + 93m = -32m Now, we have -192 = -32m. Next, to isolate m, we divide both sides of the equation by -32, which is the coefficient of m.  So, -192 / -32 = m Note that when we divide a negative number by another negative number, we get a positive number. So, m = 192 / 32 Which simplifies to m = 6.

The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur.  The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation.

Question: suppose a bird finds more twigs on the ground happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER nests.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"If a bird finds more twigs on the ground, it can potentially affect the size and number of nests that they build. To understand the impact on the type of nests - less or smaller nests - we need to consider a few factors such as the bird's nesting behavior, species, and habitat availability. Option A: More less or smaller nests One potential outcome is that the bird might build more less or smaller nests with the increased availability of twigs. This could happen in a few scenarios - 1. Territorial birds: Some bird species are territorial and may build multiple nests in their territory to prevent other birds from settling in. Having more twigs allows the bird to invest its time and energy in creating a larger number of smaller nests, which would enhance its territorial claims. 2. Mate attraction: Certain bird species construct multiple nests to attract a mate. In such cases, a larger number of twigs may encourage the bird to create more nests, even if they are less or smaller. 3. Nest failure and rebuilding: Birds, especially the ones that nest in regions with declining habitats or increased predation, may experience nest failures. Having more twigs readily available may lead them to quickly rebuild a new, less or smaller nest without too much effort. Option B: Less less or smaller nests Another possible outcome is that with more twigs on the ground, the bird might build fewer less or smaller nests. This could result from the following situations - 1. Energy conservation: As birds expend energy in nest-building, an abundance of twigs might enable them to build a more substantial and durable nest with less effort, reducing the need for additional nests or frequent rebuilding. 2. Protective measures: A well-built and sturdy nest is more difficult for predators to access or destroy. With more twigs available, birds can focus on creating a single, well-constructed nest that keeps their eggs and young safe, ultimately reducing the number of less or smaller nests. Option C: No effect It's also possible that the increased availability of twigs might have no effect on the nest size or number, as the bird's nesting behavior could be established by their inherent instincts and not significantly influenced by the twig supply. In conclusion, the availability of more twigs on the ground could lead to more, fewer, or have no effect on the number of less or smaller nests, depending on the bird species, nesting habits, and environmental factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Apply a hair mask at least once a month to provide deep conditioning and to encourage softness and shine. Use a hair mask that's specially designed for your hair type, whether your hair is dry, oily or colored. Good hair masks can be found in pharmacies and hair salons. Alternatively, you can make your own hair mask, using ingredients from your kitchen.   For all hair types: avocado and honey: Cut and scoop out the flesh from a ripened avocado and mix in a tablespoon of organic honey. Apply to hair and allow it to sit for 20 minutes before rinsing it off in the shower.   For dry hair: olive oil and egg: Combine three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil with two eggs and apply the mixture to your hair and let the mixture sit for 20 minutes before rinsing in the shower with cool water (so the egg doesn't cook!). If you do not like the smell of raw eggs, you can use a ready egg oil (eyova) instead.    For oily hair: apple cider vinegar and lemon: Combine 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar with the grated peel of an entire lemon and allow it to set for 15 minutes to absorb the excess oil from your scalp, and then rinse in the shower.    For flaky scalp: banana, honey and almond: Mash together 1/2 a ripe banana and add two tablespoons of honey and a few drops of almond oil and allow it to set with a shower cap on for 20 minutes before rinsing. Apply to serum to wet hair before drying, or to freshly blow-dried hair. It will help keep your hair soft and shiny, while minimizing frizz.  Usually only a very small amount of serum is required (dime-sized amount). Apply serum to ends and mid lengths of hair, but avoid the roots, otherwise your hair will look greasy. It is crucial to apply some sort of heat protection product before subjecting your hair to high temperatures from irons and dryers. Heat is your hair's worst enemy, so use a heat-protection spray to lock in moisture and minimize burning and breakage.  Heat protection products come in many forms, including sprays, serums, mousses and creams. Always apply heat protection to wet or damp hair to ensure it absorbs fully. If you apply to dry hair, it will sit on top of the hair and will not provide adequate heat protection. You know how important it is to protect your skin from harmful UV rays, but what about your hair? The sun can be drying and damaging to your hair, so it's important to use products that are specifically designed to minimize of sun damage. These products can help prevent highlighted hair from lightening too quickly and looking fried, and they can keep dark hair from turning brassy or red.  Most UV shields are finishing products such as UV-based hairsprays or leave-in conditioners. Keep in mind that UV shielding products always need to be applied to damp hair. Otherwise, they'll sit on the surface and won't sink into the hair. Avoid shampoos, conditioners and other hair care products that contain harsh sulfates, parabens or sodium chlorine. These ingredients will build up in hair over time, causing damage and weighing down your locks.","output":"Use a hair mask monthly for deep conditioning and improved hair health.

Oxygen makes up approximately 46.6% of the Earth's crust by weight. It is followed by silicon, which accounts for about 27.7%. These two elements combine to form silicates, which are the primary components of many rocks and minerals on Earth. Oxygen's abundance is attributed to various factors. One of the primary reasons is its high reactivity, which allows it to readily form compounds with other elements. Moreover, oxygen was formed in large quantities in the early Universe through the process of nuclear fusion in stars, which later dispersed oxygen and other elements into the interstellar medium. From there, these elements eventually became incorporated into the solar system and formed the planets, including Earth. The abundance of oxygen on Earth is further increased by the presence of water, which is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). When considering the Earth's crust, the composition varies depending on the specific location. In general, the crust is predominantly composed of igneous rocks, such as granite and basalt, as well as sedimentary rocks, like limestone and sandstone. All of these rocks are formed primarily from the combination of oxygen, silicon, and other elements like aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Collectively, these elements form the bulk of the Earth's crust. A more detailed breakdown of the Earth's crust composition by weight includes: 1. Oxygen (O): 46.6% 2. Silicon (Si): 27.7% 3.

Information:  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - American literature is the literature written or produced in the area of the United States and its preceding colonies. For more specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition.  - A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.  - Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899  July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.  - A memoir (from French: \\"mémoire\\": \\"memoria\\", meaning \\"memory\\" or \\"reminiscence\\") is a collection of memories that an individual writes about moments or events, both public or private, that took place in the subject's life. The assertions made in the work are understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A biography or autobiography tells the story \\"of a life\\", while a memoir often tells \\"a story from a life\\", such as touchstone events and turning points from the author's life. The author of a memoir may be referred to as a \\"memoirist\\" or a \\"memorialist\\".  - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.  - Elizabeth Hadley Richardson (November 9, 1891  January 22, 1979) was the first wife of American author Ernest Hemingway. The two married in 1921 after a courtship of less than a year, and moved to Paris within months of being married. In Paris, Hemingway pursued a writing career, and through him Hadley met other expatriate British and American writers.  - An expatriate (often shortened to expat) is a person temporarily or permanently residing, as an immigrant, in a country other than that of their citizenship. The word comes from the Latin terms \\"ex\\" (\\"out of\\") and \\"patria\\" (\\"country, fatherland\\").  - An autobiography (from the Greek, -\\"autos\\" self + -\\"bios\\" life + -\\"graphein\\" to write) is a written account of the life of a person written by that person. In other words, it is a self-written life story.  - A Moveable Feast is a memoir by American author Ernest Hemingway about his years as a struggling , young , expatriate journalist and writer in Paris in the 1920s . The book describes the author 's apprenticeship as a young writer while he was married to his first wife , Hadley Richardson . The memoir consists of various personal accounts , observations , and stories by Hemingway . He provides specific addresses of apartments , bars , cafes , and hotels -- many of which can still be found in Paris today . Among other notable persons , people featured in the book include : Sylvia Beach , Hilaire Belloc , Aleister Crowley , John Dos Passos , F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald , Ford Madox Ford , James Joyce , Wyndham Lewis , Pascin , Ezra Pound , Evan Shipman , Gertrude Stein , Alice B. Toklas and Hermann von Wedderkop . The memoir , not published during Hemingway 's lifetime , was published posthumously from his manuscripts and notes by his fourth wife and widow Mary Hemingway in 1964 , three years after Hemingway 's death . An edition altered and revised by his grandson , Seán Hemingway , was published in 2009 .  - Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \\"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\\" (original Swedish: \\"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning\\"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \\"work\\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.    What is the relationship between 'a moveable feast' and 'autobiography'? Answer:","output":"A Moveable Feast is a memoir by American author Ernest Hemingway, which falls under the category of autobiography. An autobiography is a self-written account of a person's life, and a memoir is a subcategory of autobiography that focuses on a collection of memories and specific events from the author's life. In A Moveable Feast, Hemingway shares his experiences as a young, struggling expatriate journalist and writer in Paris during the 1920s, providing personal accounts, observations, and stories while he was married to his first wife, Hadley Richardson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a title for this article: Air Force One is protected by electronic jammers from most missiles, likely including the one that may have shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over the Russian-Ukrainian border Thursday. Why aren’t commercial airliners protected, too? This has been a debate ever since the development of small, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles like the U.S. Stinger nearly 35 years ago, and the resulting fears that such weapons could fall into the wrong hands. It may cost the airline industry billions of dollars, but Pentagon officials spoke of the need for such defenses in 2002, after a pair of Russian-made shoulder-launched Strela-2 missiles narrowly missed an Israeli 757 as it took off from the Kenyan city of Mombassa with 271 aboard. MH17 may have been downed by a bigger, radar-guided missile, in which case defenses against shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles wouldn’t have worked. But defeating missiles is a problem the Pentagon has been grappling with for some time: In 1999, the Defense Department told Congress the biggest threat to its cargo planes was shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles like the ones fired in Mombassa. In 2002, the Pentagon awarded a 23 million contract to outfit four Air Force C-17 cargo planes with sophisticated equipment to protect them from Stingers, SA-7s and other portable heat-seeking missiles favored by terrorists. “That’s more than 5 million per plane,” an Air Force officer said at the time. “Once the first U.S. commercial airliner is shot down—and U.S. airlines rush to install these systems on their own planes—the price will drop to 2 million or 3 million per plane.” Not exactly a bargain, but some U.S. defense officials have long believed that such systems will have to become standard equipment aboard U.S. airliners. That 2002 system was an updated version of the AN/AAQ-24 (V) Nemesis, which protects both big transports (apparently including Air Force One) and military helicopters. Built by the Northrop Grumman Corp., it is known as the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures — LAIRCM — system, and plans were to outfit the hundreds of cargo planes and tankers operated by the U.S. Air Force. LAIRCM automatically detects, tracks and jams infrared missiles, sending a high-intensity laser beam into the missile’s seeker to disrupt its guidance system. No action is required by the crew. The pilot simply is informed that a threat missile was detected and jammed. “Inexpensive, yet lethal, surface-to-air missiles have proliferated around the globe and unfortunately are in the hands of our potential adversaries,” Arnold Welch, vice president for Infrared Countermeasures Programs at Northrop Grumman’s Defensive Systems Division in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, said at the time. “It is essential that our military pilots and air crews have this sophisticated type of protection in order to perform their missions and return safely.” Early reports from Ukraine suggest the plane may have been downed by a tracked Russian-built Buk missile system. Flying at about 33,000 feet, the airliner was beyond the range of most man-portable missiles. The Buk missile uses radar to guide itself to its target, unlike the heat-seeking Stinger. Planes trying to elude radar-guided missiles can use various electronic jammers and disperse clouds of foil-like chaff to confuse the missile’s radar by confusing it with multiple targets. The threat of SAM attacks on U.S. airliners was acknowledged in an FAA study in 1993, which noted that as passenger and baggage screening became more rigorous, the chances of missile strikes would rise. The U.S. government’s interest in the problem followed its decision to supply Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan—whose ranks included the late Osama bin Laden and many of his al-Qaeda lieutenants—with about 1,000 Stinger missiles in the 1980s. Pentagon officials credit the Stinger with downing about 250 Soviet aircraft. The discovery of a Strela-2 (dubbed the SA-7 by NATO) missile tube near a Saudi military base used by U.S. warplanes in 2001 prompted the FBI to alert U.S. law-enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for any signs that terrorists were planning shoulder-fired missile attacks. While the missile found in Saudi Arabia remained in its tube, burn marks suggested a bungled effort to fire it, U.S. officials said. A Sudanese with possible al Qaeda links was arrested in connection with the missile. “The FBI possesses no information indicating that al-Qaeda is planning to use ‘Stinger’ missiles or any type of MANPAD (MAN Portable Air Defense) weapons system against commercial aircraft in the United States,” the 2001 FBI warning said. “However, given al-Qaeda’s demonstrated objective to target the U.S. airline industry, its access to U.S. and Russian-made MANPAD systems, and recent apparent targeting of U.S.-led military forces in Saudi Arabia, law enforcement agencies in the United States should remain alert to potential use of MANPADs against U.S. aircraft.” Title:","output":"\\"Why Don't Commercial Airplanes Have Missile Protection Like Air Force One?\\""},{"instruction":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a context passage, a question about that paragraph, and a possible answer to that question. The task is to check the validity of the answer. Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Input: The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania. <sep>What was the name of the person who heard, \\"Yes Sir\\" while in the conference room?<sep>President Output:","output":"In this task, you are given a context passage about a conversation between the Vice President and the President regarding the rules of engagement for the CAP.

The phrase \\"Фантастические звери и места их обитания\\" is the Russian title for the book and film \\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\", a spin-off of the Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling. Let's delve into the series a little to get a better understanding of it. The franchise is set decades before the Harry Potter series, focusing on Newt Scamander, a Magizoologist, who studies magical creatures, also known as 'fantastic beasts', and their habitats. The first book, \\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\", serves as a textbook mentioned in the Harry Potter series. Written by the acclaimed author J.K. Rowling under the pseudonym Newt Scamander, it covers the history of Magizoology and describes 85 magical species found around the wizarding world. Originally, the textbook was written for educational purposes, to be used by Hogwarts students, but later made available for muggles (humans without magical ability). On the other hand, the film series of the same name is an expansion of the wizarding world from the Harry Potter films. It introduced fans to a new era of the wizarding world set in the 1920s, decades before Harry Potter was born. The leading character, Newt Scamander, journeys to several continents observing, rescuing, and taking care of an array of magical creatures. The series also provides backstory about the rise of dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, who was mentioned in the original Harry Potter series. Just as \\"Фантастические звери и места их обитания\\" translates to \\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\" in English, the phrase likely carries the same meaning and resonance for Russian fans, invoking the same sense of magical adventure and discovery. In the broader sense, it illustrates the profound influence of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world, transcending cultural and language barriers, creating a global community of fans all finding a common connection in the love for magic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record.

He's furious that she left him, outraged over her \\"silly Reno divorce\\" and indignant that she is playing around with young men, in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast. They argue vehemently until a furious Christine slaps her husband's face four times. He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach. He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who think that he is the escaping murderer.Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses. Also, he is known to own a raincoat matching the murder weapon, a belt coiled in the form of a large question mark that lay near the corpse. Robert claims innocence, but in the crowd that has gathered, none believe him. At first Tisdall is confident that it's all a misunderstanding.After an overnight interrogation at the police station, it's established that he knew Christine and is struggling economically, so his motive seems to be £1,200 left to him in her will.

Would \\"LCDs are used in a wide range of applications including computer monitors , televisions , instrument panels , aircraft cockpit displays , and signage.\\" be a reasonable answer?  +No. +Yes. Answer:","output":"No, the provided statement does not explain how LCD monitors work. It only states various applications of LCDs. A more detailed answer would be: LCD monitors work by using Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technology, which manipulates the polarization of light passing through it. Here's a simplified explanation of how LCD monitors function: 1. Backlight: The foundation of an LCD monitor is the backlight, typically made up of LEDs or CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp). It provides a consistent light source behind the screen. 2. Polarizing filters: A pair of polarizing filters are placed on either side of the system. They help in directing the lightwaves in a specific orientation. The first filter polarizes the light vertically, while the second filter, placed near the screen surface, is horizontally polarized. 3. Color filters and subpixels: The liquid crystal layer is made up of pixels, which are divided into three subpixels—red, green, and blue. Each subpixel has color filters, allowing only the corresponding color light to pass through. 4. Liquid crystals: In between the pair of polarizing filters is a layer containing liquid crystals. These crystals can change their orientation when an electrical voltage is applied to them. They impact the polarization of the incoming light, deciding whether it will pass through the second filter or not. 5. Electrodes and addressing: To manipulate each individual subpixel, a grid of thin film transistors (TFTs), acting as electrodes, is used. They control the voltage applied to the liquid crystals, and hence, determine their orientation. 6. Combining the elements: When voltage is applied, the liquid crystals adjust their orientation, effectively allowing light to pass through the second polarizing filter based on the extent of the twist. As different voltages are applied to the subpixels, the combination of different intensities of red, green, and blue light creates a vast palette of colors that make up the image on the screen. Essentially, LCD monitors control light from the backlight source by adjusting the twist of liquid crystal molecules and using polarizing filters, color filters, and electrodes to display images or text on the screen."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

We previously demonstrated that arachidonic acid levels are increased and docosahexaenoic acid levels are decreased in affected tissues from cystic fibrosis-knockout mice. In this study we determined whether humans with mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene have a similar fatty acid defect in tissues expressing CFTR.     METHODS Fatty acids from nasal- and rectal-biopsy specimens, nasal epithelial scrapings, and plasma were analyzed from 38 subjects with cystic fibrosis and compared with results in 13 obligate heterozygotes, 24 healthy controls, 11 subjects with inflammatory bowel disease, 9 subjects with upper respiratory tract infection, and 16 subjects with asthma.     RESULTS The ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic acid was increased in mucosal and submucosal nasal-biopsy specimens (P<0.001) and rectal-biopsy specimens (P=0.009) from subjects with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic sufficiency and subjects with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency, as compared with values in healthy control subjects. In nasal tissue, this change reflected an increase in arachidonic acid levels and a decrease in docosahexaenoic acid levels. In cells from nasal mucosa, the ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic acid was increased in subjects with cystic fibrosis (P<0.001), as compared with healthy controls, with values in obligate heterozygotes intermediate between these two groups (P<0.001). The ratio was not increased in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease. Subjects with asthma and those with upper respiratory tract infection had values intermediate between those in subjects with cystic fibrosis and those in healthy control subjects.     CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that alterations in fatty acids similar to those in cystic fibrosis-knockout mice are present in CFTR-expressing tissue from subjects with cystic fibrosis..

Tashman was best known for her supporting roles as tongue-in-cheek villainesses and the vindictive \\"other woman.\\" She made 66 films over the course of her Hollywood career and although she never obtained superstar status, her cinematic performances are described as \\"sharp, clever and have aged little over the decades.\\" Tall, blonde, and slender with fox-like features and a throaty voice, Tashman freelanced as a fashion and artist's model in New York City. In 1932, Tashman entered the hospital in New York City for an appendectomy that is now considered a concealment for abdominal cancer. She left the hospital thin and weak. Although she made five films in her last years, performing with her usual artistry and professionalism, she weakened significantly in the months following her hospitalization and her role in Riptide was trimmed because of her ever-worsening health.  In February 1934, she flew to New York City to film Frankie and Johnny for All Star Productions (released by Republic Pictures) but her condition necessitated a week of rest in Connecticut with Lowe. She resumed work in March, completing her film role on March 8 and then appearing at the Israel Orphan's Home benefit on March 10. When she entered the hospital for surgery on March 16, it was too late for the doctors to help her.  Tashman died of cancer at Doctor's Hospital in New York City on March 21, 1934 at the age of 37. Her funeral was held on March 22 in New York City synagogue Temple Emanu-El with Sophie Tucker, Mary Pickford, Fanny Brice, Cecil Beaton, Jack Benny, and other distinguished celebrities in attendance. Eddie Cantor delivered the eulogy. The burial in Brooklyn's Washington Cemetery attracted 10,000 fans, mourners, and curious onlookers; it became a near riot when people were injured and a gravestone was toppled. Tashman left no will, but the distribution of her 31,000 in cash and 121,000 in furs and jewels provoked contentious discussion among her husband and sisters, Hattie and Jennie. Her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released posthumously in May 1936 with her role as Nellie Bly cut to a cameo. How did she handle this?","output":"Lilyan Tashman handled her deteriorating health and the challenges it presented with grace and professionalism. Despite weakening significantly after her appendectomy, which was believed to be a cover for her abdominal cancer treatment, she continued to work diligently in the film industry. Tashman made five films during her final years, maintaining her reputation for artistry and professionalism. She continued to work on her last film, Frankie and Johnny, even amidst ongoing health struggles. In February 1934, she took a week of rest in Connecticut with her husband Edmund Lowe, before resuming work in March. Throughout this period, Tashman remained dedicated to both her career and charitable events, appearing at the Israel Orphans' Home benefit on March 10, just days before she entered the hospital for surgery. Her dedication to her profession and her spirit of philanthropy were testaments to her strength and determination in the face of adversity. Even though she was unable to fully recover, Tashman continued to put her best foot forward both on and off the screen, handling her illness with professionalism and grace. Her commitment to her work and her ability to face her health challenges head-on left a lasting impact on both her fans and fellow Hollywood stars. Her funeral, which attracted a large number of celebrities and fans, showed the immense respect and admiration people had for her. Eddie Cantor's eulogy encapsulated the way Tashman lived her life and her legacy in the entertainment industry. The fact that her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released posthumously in May 1936, with her role as Nellie Bly reduced to a cameo, further demonstrated how she remained an important figure in Hollywood even in her final days."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this and answer the question The hole walls for boards with two or more layers can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes.  These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.

A positive review typically emphasizes the features, aspects, and characteristics that standout and contribute to positive experiences. Below is an example of a positive review for a fictional restaurant called 'The Enchanted Bistro.' Title: A Heavenly Culinary Experience Last weekend, I had the pleasure of dining at 'The Enchanted Bistro,' and I am still awestruck by the unforgettable experience. Not only was the food absolutely divine, but the overall ambiance, service, and attention to detail made the experience one I would highly recommend to friends and family. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by an elegant and welcoming atmosphere. The decor was stylish and contemporary, with exquisite lighting and warm hues that made us feel right at home. The staff, from the hostess to the servers, were professional, courteous, and attentive, ensuring that we were well-taken care of throughout the evening. The menu at 'The Enchanted Bistro' showcased an array of creative and delicious dishes, which made it difficult to decide what to order. However, our server Jessica was well-versed in the menu and provided insightful recommendations, making our decision more manageable. To start, we indulged in the smoked salmon bruschetta, which was a delightful symphony of flavors. The crunchiness of the crostini perfectly complemented the delicate taste of the smoked salmon, while the zesty lemon caper aioli elevated the entire dish. For our entrees, we were torn between the fresh pasta with oxtail ragu and the almond-crusted sea bass. We opted for both, and we were certainly not disappointed. The pasta was tender and full of hearty, robust flavors that left us craving for more. The sea bass, on the other hand, was cooked to perfection with a beautifully crispy almond crust that added depth to the mild, flaky fish. The accompanying vegetable medley, with hints of garlic and herbs, accentuated both dishes, making them absolute standouts. The pièce de résistance came in the form of dessert – a sumptuous chocolate lava cake with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream. The rich, decadent chocolate melted in our mouths while the tangy raspberry coulis provided a refreshing touch, balancing the indulgence. The velvety vanilla ice cream was the final note of perfection, concluding our meal on a high. Overall, the inviting ambiance, the exceptional service, and the heavenly culinary creations make 'The Enchanted Bistro' a must-visit destination for any gastronome looking to enjoy a positively memorable dining experience. I eagerly anticipate my next visit, ready to explore more of what this wonderful and enchanting establishment has to offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? This is the most crucial point of your vault. For your first few runs, you should hold the pole above your head with your arms outstretched and be ready to place it directly in the center of the box, on the back edge. As you become more comfortable, you can rest the pole over your shoulder or hold it next to your waist, raising it above your head to plant it as you approach the box. This is the beginning of your jumping motion as you are pushing off of the ground and using the pole as leverage while you pull on it. Your leg on the non-dominant side of your body will still be on the ground as you push up, with your toe pointed. This will give you lift and the pole will begin to bend. Your lower arm should continue pushing on the pole to keep your body moving up and forward. The leg that was pointed will help your body move into an upside-down position. Keep pushing with your lower hand to get yourself as close to upside-down as possible. Bring your dominant hand, which should still be toward the top of the pole, down to your hip in a pulling motion on the pole. Use your core muscles to keep your body moving and keep you close to the pole. Initiate the turn by turning your dominant foot to the inside.  As you pull your body should naturally turn around the pole so that your belly is now facing the pit. At this point, you will be completely upside down. Try to keep your legs straight above your head while you push off of the pole. Let go of the pole as you feel yourself falling away from your maximum height.  Letting your legs fall down too quickly can take height off of your jump. Be careful not to let go too quickly, as you can fall headfirst into the box. It’s better to hold on for too long while you are learning, rather than risk an injury. Summary:","output":"In pole vaulting, maintain proper pole positioning and technique while leveraging momentum, core strength, and body movements to achieve optimum lift, transitioning into an upside-down position before releasing the pole at maximum height to complete the jump."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Imagine there are some friends talking, and they are discussing about another friend named Dominica. Jeremy is a little worried because he can't find Noel, who went outside for some fresh air. Jeremy and Jeremiah have different opinions about Dominica. Let's see what they say: Jeremy: Hey Jeremiah, have you seen Noel anywhere? I can't find him. Jeremiah: He went outside for a little bit, like when someone goes to the playground. He's having a cigarette, which is like a little break for grown-ups. Jeremy: Oh, okay. I hope he's back soon. By the way, Noel was talking to me earlier about how he thinks Dominica is really cool. He finds her hot, which means he thinks she is very pretty and attractive, like a princess. He also thinks she's independent and smart, and that she can do things by herself, just like how we can tie our own shoes! Jeremiah: Hmm, I don't see Dominica the same way Noel does though. I actually think she's a bit aggressive, like when someone wants to play with your favorite toy and won't give it back. Sometimes, she can be like a bossy big sister telling you what to do.

People from all over the world came to visit this magical place, full of bright lights, tall buildings, and lots of fun things to do. There were people pouring shots and taking pictures of others. \\"Pouring shots\\" means someone was serving little drinks, and \\"shooting portraits\\" means they were taking pictures of people. In the old Times Square, people would gather to have fun and celebrate. There were many parties where people shared cheers with tiny drinks called \\"shots.\\" These shots were like little happy potions that made people feel merry and excited. Adults liked to drink shots at parties, but don't worry; these were only for grown-ups! Besides pouring shots, there were lots of talented artists who loved taking pictures of people. They were called photographers. They would set up their special photo-taking machines, called cameras, to capture the smiling faces and excitement of the people who were visiting Times Square. A picture is like a frozen moment in time when we can look back and remember the fun we had. Taking photos in the old Times Square was different than it is today. Back then, photographers used big machines that had big black boxes, and long silver things to make the pictures look nice and bright. In those days, the photographs would come out in black and white, like a drawing made with pencils. Those photographers were very good at \\"shooting portraits,\\" helping people to look their best, and making them feel like movie stars. People could then take those pictures home to show their friends and family and remember their fun times in Times Square. So, in the old Times Square, there were fancy drinks called shots and magical photo-taking machines. There was so much happiness and joy in that magical place, with people coming together to celebrate and have a good time. Pouring shots and shooting portraits made Times Square feel like a fun, sparkling wonderland full of smiling faces and wonderful memories. And even though things are different now, we can still remember the old times and celebrate together in new and exciting ways! So next time you're in Times Square, think about how it looked back then, and imagine all the fun people had pouring shots and shooting portraits in the old days."},{"instruction":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: hvac service book Review: everything that I have ordered from amazon has gotten to me in record time,I have been very satisfied with there service including this last order it was in perfect condition, Thank you amazon and people selling your things on amazon for being honest and following through with your agreements.

Paragraph:  Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary.  His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing.  The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church.  As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man.  At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw.  But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road.  As he did so he glanced back.  A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it.  He was now bending down, probably with the object of concealing his identity, and had moved on a few paces farther down the road.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What happens next in this paragraph? How to prepare a garden plot  Pick a spot that fits the sunlight needs of your plants.  Vegetables and flowers usually require at least six hours of full, continuous sunlight a day to thrive. However, some plants prefer shade or little sun.","output":"After identifying the appropriate location for your garden plot based on sunlight needs, the next steps to follow for preparing the garden plot are: 1. Assess the Soil: Before you start working the soil, get a soil test performed to determine the pH level and nutrient content of your soil. Results from the soil test will provide insights on the amendments required for optimal plant growth. Typically, a pH ranging from 6.0-7.0 is ideal for most plants. You can also check the soil's texture and drainage capacity which may impact plant growth. 2. Clear and Mark the Space: Clear the designated garden plot area of any debris, leaves, rocks, and weeds that might prevent plant growth. Once cleared, mark the boundaries of your plot with string or stakes, ensuring you leave enough space between garden beds for maneuvering and maintenance. Measuring and staking out the space helps to visualize the garden layout before planting and account for the space needed for plant growth. 3. Till or Loosen the Soil: Tilling or digging the soil to a depth of 10-12 inches helps to break up compacted earth, improve aeration, and promote optimal root development. This process can be done using a shovel, garden fork, or a mechanical tiller; however, be mindful not to over-till the soil as that can disrupt its structure and lead to further compaction. 4. Amend the Soil: Based on the findings from your soil test, incorporate necessary amendments such as organic matter, compost, peat moss, or aged manure into the soil to enhance fertility, improve structure, and create an optimal growing environment. Ensure the amendments are thoroughly mixed with the existing soil to guarantee uniform distribution. 5. Create Garden Beds: Arrange the garden beds according to the planned layout, considering factors such as crop rotation, companion planting, and plant growth habits. Garden beds can be linear, square, or circular depending on the available space and aesthetic preferences. Raised beds can offer better drainage for waterlogged areas and help to alleviate back strain during planting and weeding. 6. Apply Mulch: Mulching the garden beds with materials such as leaves, straw, or wood chips helps to retain moisture, suppress weed growth, regulate soil temperature, and add organic matter as it decomposes over time. Spread mulch around the base of your plants, maintaining a 2-3 inch layer while avoiding direct contact with plant stems to prevent rot.  7. Water and Fertilize: Like sunlight, providing an adequate supply of water is essential for the well-being of your garden plot. Install a drip irrigation system or routinely water the garden based on specific plant requirements, ensuring that the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. As the plants start to grow, apply appropriate fertilizers and nutrients to support their development and address any nutrient deficiencies. 8. Monitor and Maintain: Regular maintenance, such as weeding, pruning, and pest control, will help to keep your garden plot healthy and flourishing. Keep an eye on the garden's progress and make adjustments as needed to manage environmental changes and seasonal variations. Finalizing the garden plot's preparation sets the groundwork for a successful growing season. Once these steps are complete, you can start planting the desired flowers, vegetables, or fruits, following the proper planting guidelines and seasonal timelines for each plant variety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her parents, Jerry and Phyllis, fly to Italy to meet her fiancé and his parents. Jerry happens to hear Giancarlos (Michelangelo's father) beautiful operatic voice while the latter sings in the shower. As a former admittedly avant-garde and critically reviled opera director, Jerry feels inspired to bring Giancarlos gift to the public. Although Giancarlo protests that he sings for himself and doesnt want to go professional, Jerry pushes the issue until Giancarlo agrees to audition in front of a room of opera bigwigs. Outside the safety of his shower, Giancarlos confidence abandons him. He makes faces and he is humiliated. Michelangelo, who attended the audition too, accuses Jerry of using his father to achieve some level of fame for himself. It occurs to Jerry that Giancarlo, like most people, sings the most confidently when he has some measure of privacy. In Giancarlos case, he performs best in his shower. Giancarlo, naked but for a towel, premieres at the Teatro dellOpera di Roma. Jerry has built him a shower onstage, and Giancarlo sings as he washes. The opera attendees love his strange performance, so Jerry and Giancarlo decide to stage Pagliacci, shower and all. Again, Giancarlos rich voice mesmerizes the crowd, and he receives rave reviews though Jerry's direction is once again utterly reviled, a fact he is not aware of since he doesn't understand Italian.

What is the cause of the preceding sentence?","output":"There can be numerous factors that could have contributed to the politician's loss in the election mentioned in the preceding sentence. While it's difficult to pinpoint an exact cause without more context, some common reasons for a political candidate's defeat in an election may include the following: 1. Weak Campaign Strategy: A successful election campaign requires a strong message, effective communication, and efficient use of resources. If the politician's campaign strategy lacked clear goals, failed to target the right voters, or mismanaged its financial resources, it could have led to the politician losing the election. 2. Lack of Voter Appeal: The politician may not have been able to resonate with a majority of the voters. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as an inability to relate to the average voter, a lack of charisma, or not effectively addressing the main concerns of the electorate. 3. Unpopular Policies: The politician may have advocated for policies that were not well-received by the voting public, negatively impacting their chances of securing enough votes to win. In some cases, voters may feel that a particular policy would not be beneficial to them or their community, leading them to cast their ballots for an opposing candidate. 4. Poor Media Coverage and Social Media Presence: In today's increasingly connected world, digital media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion. The politician may not have been able to manage their media interactions effectively or failed to maintain a strong social media presence, resulting in a negative image or low visibility among the electorate. 5. Scandals and Controversies: The politician may have been involved in scandals or controversies that damaged their reputation, leading voters to question their integrity and fitness for office. In the age of information, negative news stories can spread quickly, significantly impacting a candidate's public image. 6. Strong Opposition: The politician's rivals may have run particularly effective campaigns, attracting voters who may have otherwise supported the losing candidate. The strength of an opponent's campaign, financial backing, and overall popularity could contribute to a candidate's defeat in an election. 7. Voter Turnout: A low voter turnout may have negatively affected the candidate, especially if their supporters were less motivated to vote compared to the opposing candidate's supporters. Voter apathy and the failure to mobilize one's voter base can ultimately lead to a loss in an election. 8. Demographic Shifts: Changes in the region's demographics may have worked against the politician's favor. An increase in new residents with different political views, shifts in the age distribution, or changes in income levels can create a new, unfavorable electoral landscape for a candidate. 9. Missteps and Gaffes: Sometimes, a politician may make mistakes during their campaign, whether in the form of speeches, interviews, or public appearances. These missteps can be perceived as a sign of incompetence, ultimately causing potential voters to lose faith in the candidate. 10. Economic Factors: A tough economic climate can make it difficult for incumbent candidates, especially when they belong to the ruling party. Voters may be more likely to support an opposition candidate in the hopes of bringing change and improving the economic situation. While any of these factors on their own may not be enough to cause a politician to lose an election, when combined, they can create considerable obstacles for a candidate to overcome. It is essential for political candidates to be aware of these potential pitfalls and develop strategies accordingly, to maximize their chances of electoral success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing as they are not conveying the same message due to differences in word placement and how the information is being structured. Let's look at these sentences in detail: (1) Surfers often travel to San Lorenzo to find powerful waves (regularly head high). In this sentence, the main idea being conveyed is that surfers frequently go to San Lorenzo in search of powerful waves that are consistently of substantial height, described as \\"head high.\\" The word \\"regularly\\" is used to modify the term \\"head high,\\" suggesting that the waves have this height quite frequently. This sentence provides a clear understanding that San Lorenzo is a location known for its consistently powerful and tall waves. (2) Surfers often travel to San Lorenzo to find powerful waves (high regularly). In this sentence, there is a rearrangement of words that leads to a change in meaning and reduced clarity. Here, the word \\"high\\" is used in isolation, and then followed by the adverb \\"regularly.\\" This creates ambiguity, as it may be interpreted in different ways: a) Surfers go to San Lorenzo to find powerful waves that are regularly high. b) Surfers often find high waves in San Lorenzo and go there regularly. The phrasing in sentence (2) makes it unclear whether \\"regularly\\" is meant to modify the traveling of surfers or the height of the waves. The structure of the sentence makes it challenging to determine the intended message with certainty. So, while both sentences refer to surfers traveling to San Lorenzo and the presence of powerful waves, they do not convey the same meaning due to differences in how information is organized and the impact of word choice. Sentence (1) provides a clear, easily understandable description of the wave heights and how they attract surfers, whereas sentence (2) creates ambiguity about the specific relationship between wave height and the frequency of surfers' traveling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Although the Palaeologi emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261, they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands. They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea. The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia, the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city-state of Venice. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the Ottomans, who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453. What is the answer to this question: In what year did Bulgaria become a vassal of the Ottomans?","output":"Bulgaria became a vassal state of the Ottomans in 1366.

Please answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — \\"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,\\" President Donald Trump vowed Monday amid growing outrage over his administration forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \\"pawns\\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \\"I say that is a very cowardly response,\\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \\"to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\\" Trump's Republican party controls both chambers in Congress, and the family border policies were set by his administration.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

Poland is a surprising educational success story: in the past decade, the country raised students' test scores from significantly below average to well above it. Polish kids have now outscored(......) American kids in math and science, even though Poland spends, on average, less than half as much per student as the United States does. One of the most striking differences between the high school Tom attended in Gettysburg and the one he ends up at in Warsaw is that the latter has no football team, or, for that matter, teams of any kind. That American high schools lavish more time and money on sports than on math is an old complaint. This is not a matter of how any given student who plays sports does in school, but of the culture and its priorities. This December, when the latest Program for International Student Assessment(PISA) results are announced, it's safe to predict that American high-school students will once again display their limited skills in math and reading, outscored not just by students in Poland but also by students in places like South Korea, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Singapore, and Japan. Meanwhile, they will have played some very exciting football games, which will have been breathlessly written up in their hometown papers. Why does this situation continue? Well, for one thing, kids like it. And for another, according to Ripley, parents seem to like the arrangement, too. She describes a tour she took of a school in Washington D.C., which costs thirty thousand dollars a year.

Given the question: Given the background: For example, a radioactive isotope of iodine (I-131) is used in both the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. The thyroid will normally absorb some iodine to produce iodine-containing thyroid hormones. An overactive thyroid gland will absorb a larger amount of the radioactive material. If this is the case, more and more radioactive iodine can be administered, where it will cluster in the diseased portion of the thyroid tissue and kill some of the nearby cells. Cancer treatments often cause patients to feel very sick, because while the radiation treatment kills the unwanted cancer cells, it causes damage to some healthy cells in the process.  and the situation: John is a doctor in a local hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A has thyroid cancer, but patient B does not have thyroid cancer. John is trying to see the difference between these two patients' reports.  Answer the following question: Which patient would have an overactive thyroid gland, patient A or patient B? The answer is:","output":"Patient A. The person with thyroid cancer, Patient A, would likely have an overactive thyroid gland. This is because, as the background information states, an overactive thyroid will absorb larger amounts of iodine. In this case, the radioactive iodine (I-131) used for diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. Hence, Patient A who has thyroid cancer will show signs of an overactive thyroid gland due to its increased uptake of the radioactive iodine. In contrast, Patient B, who does not have thyroid cancer, will not have such increased iodine uptake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While they both started out with the same clear vision of their objectives, the journey there was a vastly different experience for each of them. He was an ambitious man, always reaching for the stars and striving to achieve the best that life had to offer. His keen intellect and razor-sharp wit had led him to believe that he could meticulously plan and control every aspect of his life. He was accustomed to getting his way, and his confidence blinded him to the unexpected turns that life often takes. Meanwhile, she too had dreams, goals, and ambitions, but her approach greatly differed from his. She had learned in her experiences that life was full of curveballs, bumps, and surprises. So she had adopted a more adaptable, fluid, and open-minded attitude in order to manage her way through those tricky situations. As they both embarked on their respective paths, the events that unfolded seemed to conspire against him. Despite his determination and careful planning, he was met with obstacles and roadblocks at every turn. His unwavering belief in his own knowledge and his ability to control the outcome of situations left him ill-prepared for the many twists and turns thrown his way. His once steady hand began to falter, and he found it increasingly challenging to continue holding onto his tightly constructed plans. On the other hand, she seemed to be continuously blessed with fortuitous opportunities and serendipitous encounters. With her ability to adapt, bend, and flex to the ever-changing world around her, she continued to overcome the obstacles that presented themselves. Even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, her resourcefulness and her ability to collaborate with others attracted an abundance of support that carried her on her journey. And so, the gap between their achievements widened, with her goals taking shape and solidifying, while his plans began to unravel and dissolve. As he stood holding onto the fragments of his shattered dreams, he was struck by the realization that he could no longer deny the inherent value of adaptability and flexibility in a world that was inherently unpredictable. But there was also a sense of loss, a tremendous sense of failure looming over him. It was as if the universe had conspired against him, leading him down a path of self-discovery and humility that he never thought possible. However, amidst the ruins of his plans, he also discovered a newfound truth: that resilience and adaptability weren't a sign of weakness, but rather a testament to strength. He learned to embrace the uncertainty, the unexpected, and the challenges that life offered him. Gradually, he too began to evolve, shifting his mindset to understand that sometimes the best-laid plans can falter in the face of the unpredictable and that success isn't measured solely by adherence to a predetermined course. While they took unique paths throughout life, both he and she gained valuable insights and grew stronger by embracing the challenges presented to them. Their contrasting approaches offered them the opportunity to learn from one another, and as the years went by, their once-divergent paths began to converge in shared understanding and wisdom. They learned that in the end, achieving goals isn't about meticulous planning and control; it's about navigating through life with resilience, adaptability, and the willingness to learn and grow with every step taken."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The interim government is under pressure from protesters to quicken the pace of reform. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Unfolding Changes in Egypt's Interim Government; New Health, Transportation Ministers Appointed In a recent development, Egypt's interim government has witnessed a shuffle in critical positions amidst the ongoing political turmoil. As the government faces mounting pressure from protesters demanding faster-paced reforms, there has been a change in guard pertaining to major ministerial positions, among which include the health, transportation, finance, and industry sectors. The government has announced the appointment of new health and transportation ministers, reflecting an attempt to steer clear of the ongoing controversies and present an image of stability and control. The individuals replacing the incumbents have yet to be publicly named. This step is perceived as a strategic move aimed at pacifying the dissatisfied populace and invigorating a more rapid pace of reform, a demand repeatedly voiced by the demonstrators. In further news concerning the shake-up, the finance and industry ministers have stepped down from their roles. Their resignation adds to the complexities of this transitional period in Egypt.  Amidst such changes, a noteworthy appointment comes to the forefront, confirming Hazem El-Beblawi as the newly assigned Finance Minister. The choice of El-Beblawi, marking him as part of the reconfigured political landscape, surely represents a significant change in the narrative of the interim government. It is expected that El-Beblawi, with his extensive experience and knowledge, will effectively handle the ongoing economic crises and undertake essential reforms. These recent alterations are seen as the government's response to appease the rising discontent among protesters. Given that public pressure has played an instrumental role in these cabinet changes, the interim government’s next course of action in expediting reforms will be observed closely. The presence of new faces in significant ministries is perceived as a promising sign of the desired change. It remains to be seen how the new ministers navigate their respective departments amidst the pressure and the high expectations for accelerated reforms. For the collective betterment of the country, it is hoped that their leadership would translate into positive and impactful changes.  The unfolding events instigate a renewed sense of anticipation for progress and provide a glimmer of hope that the pace of reform will indeed be quickened. The world watches keenly as Egypt's interim government repositions itself to tackle the challenges head-on and work towards the stability demanded by its people. Justification:  Given that the initial information was just highlights, I first draft a title that best encapsulates the news article's content. I then start the article addressing the context, in this case, the current political situation in Egypt's interim government. I mention the appointment of new health and transportation ministers, and resignations of the finance and industry ministers. I also include the appointment of Hazem El-Beblawi as the new Finance Minister, providing his context in the unfolding situation. Lastly, I end the article by discussing the expectations from the new appointments and what they might mean for Egyptian reforms, ensuring to keep the tone neutral and professional, typical for news articles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence \\"The photographer got the child to smile\\" implies that the photographer has successfully managed to make the child feel comfortable, happy, or amused, resulting in a smile on the child's face. This accomplishment of getting a genuine smile from the child is a crucial moment for the photographer, as it generally means that they have captured the desired emotion and expression for the photograph. Therefore, it is logical to assume that, upon seeing the child's smile, the photographer would quickly snap the child's photo to capture that perfect moment. While changing the child's pose may still be relevant to the overall process of photography, the sentence specified the act of making the child smile. The focus is on the achievement of capturing the perfect smile, which directly corresponds to the action in option a). Photographers often aim to capture authentic emotions and moments, and a genuine smile can make a photograph feel more natural and lively, making for a more attractive final result. In this context, it's reasonable to say that the photographer quickly snapped the child's photo, as it showcases the desired emotion of happiness and positively impacts the overall success of the photo.

With a meandering plot, unlikable characters, and uninspired visuals, this movie tragically failed to deliver on its immense potential. The film's convoluted plot left audiences scratching their heads. Instead of cultivating tension and intrigue, the storyline was riddled with illogical twists and turns that constantly shattered the suspension of disbelief. The lack of continuity, in addition to an overabundance of flashbacks, ultimately created a disorienting experience that detracted from any potential emotional investment. While an intricate plot can be forgiven if audiences find themselves deeply connected to the characters, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Catastrophe\\" severely failed on that front as well. The characters were frustratingly one-dimensional, leaving audiences apathetic to their plights. Any semblance of character development seemed to be quickly undermined, which kept viewers from forming any genuine attachment. Additionally, the lack of chemistry between the leads made their love story feel hollow and contrived. One would hope that the visuals could at least redeem the movie, but alas, even this was disappointing. The cinematography was uninspired, with a mundane color palette and bland backdrops. The visual effects were, at times, laughably amateurish, detracting from any sense of immersion. Moreover, the action sequences were poorly executed and edited, often leaving the audience feeling disoriented. To compound these issues, the film’s pacing was abysmal. What could have been an engaging, suspenseful movie was weighed down by an onslaught of tedious exposition and inconsequential scenes. In the end, it felt like a test of endurance, prompting audiences to check their watches, wondering when the agonizing experience would finally come to an end. What's truly maddening about \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Catastrophe\\" might be the sheer waste of talent. Its cast, featuring several acclaimed actors known for previous standout performances, was tragically undermined by a weak script, poor direction, and uninspired character arcs. In conclusion, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Catastrophe\\" leaves viewers longing for something more. With a problematic plot, stale performances, lackluster visuals, and abysmal pacing, this film is better left unseen. Whatever potential the original concept may have had is woefully squandered in a movie that will be remembered only for its failure to excel in any aspect of filmmaking. It is a prime lesson in what can go wrong when great potential is met with poor execution."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Tabor and his wife, Elizabeth McCourt, better known as \\"Baby Doe\\". Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. Then he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \\"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\\" he said. As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco. It was his custom to \\" _ \\" prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or \\"grub\\", while they looked for ore , in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value. Finally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \\"grub\\". Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \\"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took 17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \\"Pittsburgh Mine,\\" made 1,300,000 for Tabor in return for his 17 investment. Later Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for 117,000. This turned out to be even more fabulous than the Pittsburgh, yielding 35,000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew.... Question: We can infer that Tabor's life career is.

Please write a short summary for the following article: A Corporate Divorce on the Cheap Nor are Chrysler’s long-term prospects clear. Cerberus dispatched its chairman, John W. Snow, the former secretary of the Treasury, to Stuttgart to drum up excitement about Chrysler’s future and to reassure managers and workers that the investment firm is not going to turn Chrysler inside out. Among Daimler executives here, however, there was a sense that they got the good end of the bargain. The company’s businesses — trucks, buses and luxury cars — are among the fastest-growing and most profitable segments in the industry. And Mercedes-Benz, after a period in which it suffered from quality concerns and eroding profits, is on an upswing. “There are more people with higher incomes,” said Garel Rhys, director of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales, “and they are living longer, so they have time to buy these cars.” Though it will become much smaller, Daimler will have a stronger balance sheet, a hoard of cash and a clear focus. “The new Daimler will stand on a very solid foundation,” the chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, said. None of this dispelled a palpable sense of regret on the part of Mr. Zetsche, who made his reputation running Chrysler and even lent his image to television commercials for its vehicles. The company will retain a 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler. “We obviously overestimated the potential of synergies,” Mr. Zetsche said of the 1998 merger. “I don’t know if any amount of due diligence could have given us a better estimate in that regard.” Daimler, he said, was not able to exploit the combination of its highly engineered Mercedes-Benz luxury cars with the mass-market vehicles of Chrysler because American motorists could not, or would not, pay a premium for a Chrysler equipped with Mercedes technology. What Daimler encountered instead were the unforgiving vagaries of the American car market. Chrysler lost 1.5 billion last year, and the losses are expected to continue this year. Finally, Mr. Zetsche said, DaimlerChrysler could no longer bear the pressure on its profits or share price. DaimlerChrysler stock closed up nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt trading on Monday, after jumping as much as 7.8 percent when news of the agreement with Cerberus was reported. It has risen 25 percent since Mr. Zetsche disclosed in February that the company was considering alternatives, including a divestiture. Mr. Zetsche insisted that Chrysler did not drain cash from Mercedes. Despite its recent losses, it generated nearly 15 billion in cumulative profits during the years it was owned by Daimler. But analysts said Daimler could have found better uses for the cash it poured into Chrysler. “They spent about 60 billion acquiring, restructuring and investing in Chrysler over the last nine years,” Mr. Jonas of Morgan Stanley said. “Just think where the next 60 billion could go if it was invested properly.” Among other things, he said, Mercedes-Benz could introduce more innovative and alluring cars to compete with German brands like BMW and Audi. BMW, which has taken the mantle of the world’s top luxury carmaker in recent years, may feel new heat from its old rival. Daimler’s residual stake in Chrysler means that it will continue to have close ties to the company. For all the difficulties between Mercedes and Chrysler, Mr. Zetsche said they had successfully cooperated in developing power trains, buying raw material and sharing logistics systems. That work will go on, under the aegis of a joint automotive council. Mr. Zetsche portrayed the arrangement as a benefit, because Daimler will be able to capitalize on cost savings or new products that flow out of its collaboration without bearing health care liabilities. “We basically have all the upside potential without the downside risk,” Mr. Zetsche said. Still, Daimler’s history as a minority shareholder is problematic. In 1999, it bought a stake in Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, thinking that the Japanese carmaker would be the third leg of its global stool. Management turmoil led Daimler to take control of Mitsubishi in 2002, and by 2004, it ended the alliance. Keeping a stake in Chrysler could also subject Daimler to criticism at home if the new owner takes radical steps. German companies that dispose of operations can be vulnerable to charges of antisocial behavior, as the engineering giant Siemens learned last year when it sold its cellular phone operation to a Taiwan company, which later shut it down. Some analysts maintain that Daimler’s 19.9 percent stake will be temporary — a sort of umbilical cord for Chrysler’s new proprietor. Executives at Cerberus said Monday that they welcomed Daimler’s continuing investment, viewing it as a way to “secure the transaction.” Mr. Snow and others from Cerberus sought to allay fears that they planned wholesale changes at Chrysler. The firm has no immediate plans for layoffs, Mr. Snow said. And he disputed suggestions that Chrysler’s unionized workers had something to fear from Cerberus. “It’s a mistake to think private equity companies are antagonistic,” Mr. Snow said in a brief interview. “Companies that don’t have the support of their workers can’t be successful.” Mr. Snow said the deal was a landmark for private equity firms “in that this great symbol of American industry is returning to American shores, to American hands; that’s important.” Other executives at Cerberus attributed their success in the bidding to their firm’s 51 percent stake in the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, G.M.’s lending arm. That investment, they said, gave Cerberus familiarity with the details of automotive finance. They also credited the participation of Wolfgang Bernhard, a former president of Chrysler, who advised on the bid. Mr. Bernhard still has close ties with Mr. Zetsche, for whom he worked at Chrysler. For its part, DaimlerChrysler said it was swayed by the fact that Cerberus could arrange financing and move swiftly to close the deal. While Mr. Zetsche said the price tag was important, it was one of several factors in choosing the Cerberus offer over rival bids by the Blackstone Group, another private equity firm, and Magna International, a Canadian auto supplier. Daimler’s payments swell from 650 million to 1.5 billion if one includes 878 million for the company’s redemption of long-term bonds issued by Chrysler. Bodo Uebber, Daimler’s chief financial officer, said it did not consider that part of the cost of the transaction because it would have had to redeem the bonds eventually. As Chrysler passes into private hands, Mr. Zetsche said he planned to stay in touch with its chief, Thomas W. LaSorda, to learn the tricks of managing under the gaze of private equity investors. “It’s always important that you learn in your life,” he said. Summary:","output":"Daimler is set to sell Chrysler to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for 7.4 billion. Although this sale price is significantly lower than the 36 billion Daimler spent on acquiring Chrysler nine years ago, it will result in a stronger balance sheet for Daimler. The company's core businesses, including trucks, buses, and luxury cars such as Mercedes-Benz, are now on an upswing and are among the fastest-growing and most profitable segments in the automotive industry. Daimler will retain a 19.9% stake in Chrysler and the two companies will continue to collaborate in areas such as powertrains, raw materials procurement, and logistics systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But now the firearms have been cast in a new light, as these X-ray images show. The intimate workings of some of cinema’s most iconic weapons, including James Bond's Walther PPK, have been revealed by British artist Nick Veasey in an attempt to 'deglamorise' guns - by reducing them to the status of scientific specimens. assassinate Abraham Lincoln to the M60 wielded by","output":"Rambo, these fascinating X-ray images provide a unique perspective on these famous weapons. Known for his attention to detail and fascination with the hidden aspects of life, Nick Veasey has captured the intricate workings of these legendary guns, from the sophisticated mechanisms that allowed John Wilkes Booth to assassinate Abraham Lincoln to the raw power of the M60 wielded by Rambo in his fight against injustice. As part of his ongoing exploration into 'seeing through the surface' of everyday objects, Veasey has used high-tech X-ray imaging techniques to demystify these iconic weapons and, in the process, challenge our perceptions of their glamorized status. By stripping away the layers and focusing on the cold, mechanical elements of the guns, the artist enables us to view them not as symbols of power and style, but as carefully engineered tools with a deadly purpose. Furthermore, the stark grayscale images emphasize the dichotomy between the artistry of the weapons' design and their lethal capabilities. By presenting these firearms in such an unconventional and dispassionate manner, Nick Veasey has managed to create a powerful commentary on the allure of guns in our society and the potential consequences of their use. From Clint Eastwood's iconic Dirty Harry quote to Al Pacino's defiant \\"say hello to my little friend\\" in Scarface, the power and mystique of guns have permeated our culture and shaped our perceptions. However, by deconstructing these cinematic weapons and forcing us to confront their inner workings, Nick Veasey's X-ray art serves as a sobering reminder that beneath the glamour lies the potential for life-altering, irreversible damage."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He knew that deep down, Robert was a kind-hearted person who genuinely wanted to change his ways. \\"Maybe it has something to do with how you interact with others, or maybe it's the environment that's causing you to act out. Have you ever thought about seeking help, like talking to the school counselor?\\" Robert shrugged. \\"I guess I could give it a try, but I'm not sure how much it would help. I mean, I don't even know what's causing me to act this way.\\" For the next couple of days, Christopher observed Robert closely, trying to identify the factors that could be contributing to his friend's misbehavior. He noticed that Robert tended to get more agitated whenever he was around particular teachers and students. Furthermore, he was quick to react in anger when faced with even the smallest of adversities. Armed with his newfound observations, Christopher decided to approach Robert with a plan to help him curb his uncontrollable impulse to act out. \\"Robert, have you ever noticed that you tend to get more agitated around certain people at school?\\" Christopher asked hesitantly, hoping his friend would not take offense. Robert looked thoughtful for a moment before nodding. \\"Yeah, actually, now that you mention it, I do feel more on edge when I'm around certain teachers and students. It's like they're subconsciously pushing me towards the edge.\\" Christopher continued, \\"I think it might be because of the negative influences in your environment. Maybe you can try changing your usual routes and habits at school to avoid people who seem to trigger you.\\" Robert considered the idea for a moment before agreeing to give it a try. Over the next few weeks, he started avoiding situations and people that seemed to set him off. He took different routes to class, switched seats in the cafeteria, and even joined a new club to make new friends. To his surprise, these changes began to have a positive impact on his behavior. The number of times he was sent to the principal's office decreased, and he found himself being able to better control his emotions. Seeing the improvement in his friend, Christopher decided to suggest the next step in Robert's journey. \\"Now that you've made some progress, why not talk to the school counselor about your emotions? They might be able to help you understand and manage them better.\\" Feeling more confident and willing to open up, Robert agreed and scheduled an appointment with the school counselor. As the weeks went by, Robert and the counselor worked together on various techniques to help him recognize and manage his emotions, such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, and self-reflection. Month after month, the two friends noticed a significant improvement in Robert's behavior. He no longer dreaded going to school, and his newfound sense of control brought him a sense of happiness he hadn't felt in a long time. Gradually, he went from being the student who always found himself in the principal's office to one who was commended for his progress and achievements. Throughout this journey, Christopher stood firmly by Robert's side, celebrating his victories and sharing his setbacks. They both knew that this transformation wasn't a result of a miracle but the outcome of a strong bond between friends and the determination to believe in the goodness within oneself. It wouldn't be long before Robert became a role model to others, proving that even the most troubled individuals could turn their lives around when supported and guided by a compassionate heart.

Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great.

Title: A Real Sleeper Review: I heard a lot about this book, so I checked it out of the library to find out what people were talking about. It takes pages and pages of flabby prose for Goldberg to get to the heart of his argument, which is largely anecdotal and mostly unverifiable. Goldberg tells us breathlessly that an unnamed person agrees with him in a two-person meeting that there is \\"liberal\\" bias in the news. Maybe it happened, but why should anyone believe it? Let's see some proof. Right-leaning reviewers love this book because it bashes \\"liberals,\\" while left-leaning reviewers dismiss it as exhibiting right-wing bias. A book so devoid of verifiable facts is probably open to this wide range of interpretation. Most readers will find their own prejudices strengthened by Goldberg's vague indictment. This insider's look at CBS News will intrigue readers of People magazine. However, if you are looking for a good read, this isn't it. Goldberg's book is self-indulgent and poorly written.

For many years I had wanted to take my family on the train. We all had been to Chicago four years ago, and the kids loved it. Chicago is one of my favorite cities, too, so the thought struck me again last fall to ride the train to Chicago. Of course, flying would have been faster. But I don't think flying is easier, especially these days, with all the security and waiting in lines at airports. Though we were tired in the middle of the night, the kids got on the train with the _ of this adventure. \\"We're moving,\\" my son William shouted happily with big eyes as the train began to pull away from the Hutchinson station. I removed my shoes and lay down to try to finish my night's sleep. The sleeper car would have better enabled that, but the ordinary train seats were not too bad. An airline flight is a more miserable experience for me: not enough room, two hours of pain with my knees almost touching my chin, the hard seatback in front cracking my kneecaps   with every move of the body planted in front of me. On the train I could almost outstretch all of my 6-foot-2-plus body in the generous legroom. The journey didn't feel at all as long as it was. We all found the train ride a joy. The car ride would have felt every minute of 13 hours. But on the train you are free to walk around, sit in the observation carriage for a while and enjoy the scenery out the windows, have a nice meal in the dining car, read a book, or play a board game. In short, the train is all about enjoying the trip, which isn't something I do so much when traveling by airline or by car, when the trip seems more of a mission   to get there than an experience to enjoy along the way.

Paragraph: Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.  Question: \\"How does air leave our lungs?\\" Answer: \\"By passing in urine\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, this answer is incorrect. According to the paragraph, air leaves our lungs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes, decreasing the size of the chest and increasing air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air to leave the lungs through the process of exhaling or breathing out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Introduction The environment consists of numerous pathogens, which are agents, usually microorganisms, that cause diseases in their hosts. A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen. Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi and other infectious organisms. We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air. Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these disease agents. Components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens. When pathogens are found, immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection. The immune factors identify the nature of the pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently, and then halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. The immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient response upon re-exposure. This memory can last several decades. Features of the immune system, such as pathogen identification, specific response, amplification, retreat, and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens. The immune response can be classified as either innate or active. The innate immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specific ones. Conversely, the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific defenses.

Question: how was marijuana discovered The answer is:","output":"No, the provided statement does not correctly answer the question \\"how was marijuana discovered?\\" as it presents a rundown of the technical, pharmocological attributes and chemical compounds of cannabis, rather than tracing its historical discovery. The discovery of marijuana (also known as cannabis) isn't attributed to a specific event or individual but goes back thousands of years in human history, marking its significance and use across different timelines, civilizations and geographical settings.  Historically, marijuana is believed to have originated in Central Asia, specifically in the regions that are now Mongolia and southern Siberia, around 12,000 years ago. Some research suggests that it was among the first crops purposely cultivated by human beings, demonstrating its integral role in early agricultural societies. In ancient times, the cannabis plant was used for a multitude of purposes, with its utility going beyond rudimentary psychoactive usage. The durable hemp derived from the plant was employed for creating items like rope, clothes, and paper. Simultaneously, the seeds were consumed as a food source due to their high nutritional value. The plant also found its application in the domain of medicine, supporting various traditional medical practices and therapies. The psychoactive properties of the plant were also discovered pretty early on. The consumption habits differed from culture to culture; while some chose to brew it in teas, others consumed it recreationally, either orally or through smoke. Some societies even used it for religious or spiritual rituals.  The plant's historic journey then moved through migration, trade routes, and conquests over centuries. Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian, wrote about the Scythians using cannabis steam for ritualistic purposes in the 5th century BCE. It found its way to the Middle East between 2000 B.C. and 1400 B.C., and by 500 A.D., it spread to the rest of the world, including Europe, Africa, and eventually the Americas. In more recent history, the recreational use of marijuana increased in the western world during the 19th century, stemming from its scientific introductions. It was only in the late 19th and early 20th century when regulatory laws began to restrict its use across numerous countries, marking the beginning of its controversial status that persists today. In conclusion, the discovery of marijuana wasn't a singular event attributable to a specific time or individual. Instead, it was an exploration and utilization of the plant’s components, primarily THC, that was understood and adopted by various societies over millennia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children.

You’ve been devastated in New York and New Jersey, and just know everyone’s thinking of you and we're doing everything we can to help.\\"      Then, in a segment taped from the hotel where he spent Wednesday night, Biden moved onto the jokes as he listed the top ten reasons why to take advantage of early voting.      \\"You know who votes early?

Article: Playing a sport in college is a big commitment. At top ranked schools, you will be playing and practicing nearly every day of the week. While in season, you will be traveling and missing classes for games.  The majority of soccer teams are regulated under the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which has three divisions. Only Division I and Division II schools are eligible to offer athletic scholarships; you can narrow your search to these schools.  Players on Division III teams can earn academic and merit scholarships, but these will not constitute soccer scholarships. This takes self-reflection and being honest with yourself about your abilities. Playing for a top ranked college is not going to be feasible if your soccer skills are not at an exceptionally high level. Playing soccer at a college level is a huge commitment and if you are not 100% committed to playing, you will not succeed.  Setting goals that are appropriate to your skill level can save you from heartache and disappointment down the line. Within Division I and Division II schools, colleges vary on their competitiveness. Look at the current college soccer rankings to identify schools that are more competitive than others. Even though you want to play soccer for this college, you are also there to get an education. The colleges that you apply to should fit your academic goals and be a good fit for you outside of soccer. Again, these goals should be realistic and reflective of your academic abilities. Colleges set academic requirements for their athletes and if you fall below this grade point average you can be suspended from the team. If you are an exceptional student, you will have more opportunities available. Talk with your high school and club coach about your skill level, your potential to win a scholarship, and where you can improve. Be candid and open with your coaches about your goals to win a scholarship and ask for their help.  Your coaches will most likely have established relationships with some colleges and recruiters. The number of contacts that your coach will have can vary widely, but they can get your foot in the door. Ask them what skills and areas you can improve on. Even the best soccer player can fine tune their skills and improve their consistency. Your coaches can help you identify the areas you are weak in so you can improve before playing in front of recruiters. Talk to other players that you know who have gone through this process and players that are now collegiate athletes. Ask them about their experiences and for advice on the process. Consider asking them questions like:  What has your experience playing soccer in college been like? What were the most challenging parts of the recruiting process? What do you wish you had known about the process before you had started it? Men and women’s teams are ranked based off of their win-loss record and performance in tournaments. If you want to focus your search to the most competitive schools, you should aim to be recruited by schools that are in the top 25 of the nation.  Men’s and women’s teams are ranked separately. You may find that some schools have stronger men’s programs than women’s or vice versa. Based on your goals, your coaches’ input, and your skill level, you can begin to identify schools that you are most interested in. This list of schools should include the name of the soccer coach and their contact information. Most schools will have a website devoted to their athletic program where you can find this information. Your list of schools should be large in the beginning of your process and become narrowed down over time. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: Playing a sport like soccer in college entails a major commitment, with demanding schedules and dedication required. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) regulates most soccer teams in the US with Divisions I and II offering athletic scholarships. Players in Division III can only receive academic and merit-based scholarships. To play soccer at a college level, individuals should be realistic about their abilities and set goals accordingly. They should also consider academic fit when choosing a college. Speaking with high school and club coaches can help guide the decision-making process, as they can give advice about scholarships and areas of improvement. Moreover, engaging with current collegiate athletes can offer valuable insights into the experience and recruitment process. To pursue a soccer career at competitive schools, aspiring college athletes should focus on institutions ranked in the top 25 in the nation and be aware that men's and women's teams are ranked separately. Based on these factors, individuals can create a list of preferred schools, gather the necessary contact information, and narrow down their choices over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Xi was appointed to the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. Xi was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the top-ranking membership of the Communist Party's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as Vice-President of the People's Republic of China.  Following his elevation, Xi has held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new President of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, the cadre-training and ideological education wing of the Communist Party. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. Xi made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008. After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of Committee Chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level Communist Party committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009.  Xi is considered to be one of the most successful members of the Crown Prince Party, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \\"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations.\\" Lee also commented: \\"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\\". Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \\"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line.\\" Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \\"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man.\\" Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tweeted, \\"Xi hosting a meeting on women's rights at the UN while persecuting feminists?

Fightstar are a British rock band from London that formed in 2003. The band is composed of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and co-vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Generally considered a post-hardcore band, Fightstar are known to incorporate metal, alternative rock and other genres into their sound. During the band's early days, they were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former pop career with Busted. On 11 August 2008 Fightstar released the B-sides album Alternate Endings, with live radio sessions, covers and a previously-unreleased track. When Gut Records went into administration at the end of 2008 the band decided to release their next album, Be Human, in a joint venture with their management company (Raw Power) on the Search and Destroy label. The album was distributed by PIAS Records. Fightstar released their first single from Be Human, \\"The English Way\\", on 3 November 2008 and it topped the UK rock chart. Its video was played on Kerrang! and Scuzz T.V., and topped the MTV2 top 10. The album was co-produced by the band and Carl Bown at Treehouse Studios, Bown's Chesterfield studio. In interviews before its release, Fightstar called the new album \\"quite different\\" from their previous releases; Charlie Simpson said that they wanted to experiment with a \\"rock opera\\" sound, including strings and a choir. Simpson said that although it might be different, it would still be a Fightstar album with their trademark dark, heavy elements. The band supported Feeder for the first part of their UK tour, which began on 21 October 2008. Drummer Jason Bowld of the British metal band Pitchshifter filled in for Omar Abidi on their UK tour while Abidi recovered from a broken wrist; Abidi returned to touring with the band in early 2009. Due to the drummer's injury, Simpson played drums on six tracks of the new album while Abidi wrote the drum parts and oversaw Simpson's playing.  On 4 February 2009, Fightstar announced a 12-date UK tour supported by In Case of Fire and Laruso. Two weeks before the release of Be Human, \\"Mercury Summer\\" was released as the next single; its video debuted on the band's MySpace page on 25 February. \\"Mercury Summer\\" was well-received, reaching the A List of the Radio 1 Playlist; the band was featured on the BBC2 music show, Sound. \\"Mercury Summer\\" was added to the daytime playlist at XFM Radio and picked as Ian Camfield's Record of the Week. Emma Scott and Kerrang Radio also made \\"Mercury Summer\\" her Record of the Week. Be Human was released on 20 April 2009, reaching the highest chart peak of any Fightstar album: number 20 on the UK Albums Chart.  The band introduced \\"A City on Fire\\" during Fearne Cotton's Radio 1 show on 19 October; its video, directed by Sitcom Soldiers, premiered on 24 October. The single was released as a digital download on 20 December and peaked at numbers four and ten on the UK Rock and Indie charts, respectively. Fightstar released a deluxe edition of Be Human on 1 March 2010 with five new tracks, including \\"A City on Fire\\" and a live cover of Jordin Sparks' \\"Battlefield\\" on the iTunes edition.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) can be found in some commercial toothpastes and mouthwashes. SLS is often used as a cheap filler to help toothpaste thicken and foam up. But this additive has been shown to increase the likelihood of developing canker sores in your mouth. Read the labels on toothpastes and mouthwashes to make sure they are free of SLS before you use them or search online for brands that specifically do not contain SLS. You can also follow good oral hygiene by choosing a soft bristle toothbrush to clean your teeth. Try to brush your teeth twice a day and after every meal. This will reduce the presence of bacteria and food particles that may cause canker sores to develop. Using a soft bristle brush will also prevent irritation in your mouth. Irritating your mouth with hard brushes can lead to the development of canker sores. Floss once each day to prevent food particles from staying in your mouth. These food particles can lead to oral health issues, including canker sores.  Get in the habit of flossing before bed as well so your mouth is clean and free of bacteria or food particles. Flossing more than once daily can be harmful to your gums. If you have braces or a retainer, make sure it is not rubbing or scratching the inside of your mouth. Poorly fitting dental equipment can lead to the development of canker sores. Talk to your dentist if you feel your dental equipment is irritating your mouth. If you have braces that are rubbing against your mouth and causing sores, try using dental wax to cover sharp edges. Summary:","output":"Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is a common additive in commercial toothpastes and mouthwashes, used to create thickness and foaming. However, SLS has been linked to an increased risk of developing canker sores. To avoid this, carefully read labels on toothpastes and mouthwashes to ensure they are SLS-free, or search for brands without SLS online. Good oral hygiene can also help prevent canker sores. Brush your teeth twice daily and after meals using a soft-bristle toothbrush to avoid irritating the mouth. Flossing once a day, preferably before bedtime, keeps your mouth clean and free from bacteria or food particles. However, excessive flossing may harm your gums. Make sure dental equipment such as braces or retainers do not rub or scratch the inside of your mouth, as this could lead to canker sores. If your dental equipment causes irritation, contact your dentist for assistance. Applying dental wax on braces can prevent sharp edges from rubbing against the mouth and causing sores."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Governments of Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide, typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war or that killings of Armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the Ottoman Empire. Passage of legislation in various foreign countries condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide has often provoked diplomatic conflict. (See Recognition of the Armenian Genocide) Who ruled Turkey when the Armenian genocide happened? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The Armenian Genocide took place during the final years of the Ottoman Empire, and the ruling authority at that time was the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), also known as the Young Turks. The Young Turks came to power after overthrowing Sultan Abdulhamid II in 1908. The key figures and leaders within the CUP during the Armenian Genocide were Mehmed Talaat Pasha, Ismail Enver Pasha, and Ahmed Djemal Pasha. Mehmed Talaat Pasha, as Minister of the Interior, was responsible for internal affairs and played an instrumental role in the organization and implementation of the Armenian Genocide policies. Ismail Enver Pasha, the Minister of War, was primarily responsible for military affairs but also had a hand in the genocide by targeting Armenian soldiers in the Ottoman army and using them for forced labor. Ahmed Djemal Pasha, the Minister of Navy, was responsible for overseeing the deportations and forced marches of Armenians to the Syrian Desert. These three figures, along with other high-ranking Young Turk officials, were largely responsible for the events that occurred during the Armenian Genocide. Their policies led to the deaths of around 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1923. Ultimately, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I saw the rise of the Republic of Turkey, which formally replaced the Ottoman Empire in 1923 under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright.

Write a title for this article: One group of analysts believes Google’s parent company should bet big on financial services and acquire AIG, the nearly century-old insurance company. The idea would be for Alphabet GOOGL to acquire the insurance provider and turn it into an innovation lab for financial services, according to an analyst note obtained by Bloomberg from Citigroup C analysts let by Todd Bault. “We realize it is a very low-probability event, while maintaining that it is still a very good idea,” says the note. In short, the acquisition would amount to marrying AIG’s AIG ongoing work to refocus its services and Google’s technology-based approach to redefining traditional industries. In the last decade, AIG has suffered from higher-than-expected claims costs, a string of executive departures, and is now under pressure from activist investors like Carl Icahn and John Paulson to whip itself into shape. Alphabet, on the other hand, changed its company structure last summer, gaining a new name and organizing it in way that creates an umbrella (Alphabet) over a constellation of business units focused on specific technologies. AIG CEO Peter Hancock has praised Alphabet’s move, even comparing his own company’s structure to it, according to Bloomberg. Alphabet has also dabbled in selling insurance, although it’s currently only focused on car insurance. With that said, Citigroup’s analysts acknowledge that Alphabet’s shareholders wouldn’t be too happy for the company to take on billions of dollars in insurance liabilities. So, they believe the solution would be to partner with an investment bank in a deal that would let Alphabet control what it knows best: data and business strategy.

In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet.

Please answer the following question: What was the last name of the older composer who Wolfgang played their harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, \\"an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries\\". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical \\"Symphony No. 0\\" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765. Wolfgang also wrote his first vocal works, the motet \\"God is our Refuge\\", K. 20, and the tenor aria Va, dal furor portata, K. 21.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex.

Choose from: (I) no (II) yes","output":"(I) no The response \\"August 15\\" correctly answers the question \\"Is the Child's real birthday on Thursday?\\" because it is explicitly mentioned that Julia Child's actual birthday is on August 15. The paragraph states that there will be a sold-out dinner on Thursday at San Francisco's Fifth Floor restaurant (and 19 other venues), which will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals.

Background: Newton Leroy Gingrich (; ne McPherson; born June 17, 1943) is an American politician and author from the state of Pennsylvania who served as the 50th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999. He represented Georgia's 6th congressional district as a Republican from 1979 until his resignation in 1999. In 2012, Gingrich was a candidate for the Republican Party presidential nomination. Context: In 1974, Gingrich made his first bid for political office as the Republican candidate in Georgia's 6th congressional district, which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, but was unable to overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.  Gingrich sought a rematch against Flynt in 1976. While the Republicans did slightly better in the 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, the Democratic candidate in the 1976 presidential election was former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter. Carter won more than two-thirds of the vote in his native Georgia. Gingrich lost his race by 5,100 votes.  As Gingrich primed for another run in the 1978 elections, Flynt decided to retire. Gingrich defeated Democratic State Senator Virginia Shapard by 7,500 votes. Gingrich was re-elected six times from this district. He faced a close general election race once--in the House elections of 1990--when he won by 978 votes in a race against Democrat David Worley. Although the district was trending Republican at the national level, conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices, as well as most of the area's seats in the General Assembly, well into the 1980s. Question: Did he win? Answer:","output":"Yes, Newt Gingrich won his first election to become a representative in Georgia's 6th congressional district in 1978. He had lost two previous attempts in 1974 and 1976, but finally succeeded when he defeated Democratic State Senator Virginia Shapard in 1978."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Morgan Gardner Bulkeley (December 26, 1837 - November 6, 1922) was an American politician, businessman, and sports executive. A Republican, he served in the American Civil War, and became a Hartford bank president before becoming the third president of the Aetna Life Insurance Company, a post he held for 43 years. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in recognition of his role as the first president of the National League. Bulkeley served on the Hartford City Council and was a four-term mayor of Hartford. Bulkeley's short career as a baseball executive coincided with the beginning of his political career. From 1874 to 1876, he served on the Hartford Common Council and the Board of Aldermen. When Thomas O. Enders resigned Aetna's presidency due to ill health in 1879, Bulkeley became the company's third president. In 1880, Bulkeley ran for both mayor of Hartford and governor of Connecticut. He lost the gubernatorial race but won the mayoral race and was Hartford's mayor from 1880 to 1888. As mayor he became known for his flamboyant generosity; for instance, arranging steamboat trips on the Connecticut River for underprivileged children, using his own money.  While mayor of Hartford, on February 11, 1885, Bulkeley married Fannie Briggs Houghton in San Francisco, California. They had two sons and a daughter.  In 1888, Bulkeley again ran for governor. In the election, Luzon B. Morris accumulated more votes than Bulkeley but neither had the required 50%. In accordance with the rules of the time, the General Assembly decided the winner and the largely Republican body chose Bulkeley. Although he did not run in 1890, the vote was so close and fell into such disarray due to ballot irregularities in Bridgeport that officials did not certify the results, and the Connecticut House of Representatives and Senate, each led by opposing parties, could not agree on a legal successor. When Bulkeley refused to recognize the Democratic candidate as the victor, the Democratic state comptroller changed the lock on an anteroom that led from the governor's office to the Statehouse. When Bulkeley found the door locked the next morning, he broke in with a crowbar, earning the nickname the \\"Crow-Bar Governor\\". When the legislature refused to appropriate money for state government operations because of the deadlock, Bulkeley, who also happened to be president of Aetna Life Insurance Co., had his company pick up the state's bills until the next election. Bulkeley remained in office two more years, and the state Supreme Court unanimously held that he had been the lawful governor for the disputed period of time.  Bulkeley later served one term in the U.S. Senate from 1905 to 1911, as part of the \\"Millionaires' Senate\\" of 1906, so named for the wealth of its members. What role did he have in the U.S. Senate?","output":"Morgan Gardner Bulkeley served one term in the U.S. Senate from 1905 to 1911.

Felicia goes out wearing a scarf but Rebecca does not. This is because","output":"Felicia finds comfort and warmth in wearing a scarf, while Rebecca does not feel the need to wear one for various reasons. This difference in preference and perspective is shaped by their personal experiences, beliefs, and factors that influence their decision-making process in their everyday lives. Felicia's preference for wearing a scarf could stem from multiple reasons. One possible explanation may be that she has thin hair or is sensitive to changing temperatures, requiring her to wear a scarf to protect her ears and neck from the cold. Felicia might have also grown up in a family that places high importance on wearing scarves to protect against the cold or has cultural significance. In this case, Felicia's scarf becomes a symbol of care and a way to maintain her family traditions. On the other hand, Rebecca might not feel the need to wear a scarf due to personal comfort. She might find a scarf too restrictive or uncomfortable to wear or even prefer other winter accessories like earmuffs or turtleneck sweaters. Moreover, Rebecca might possess a thicker head of hair, which makes a scarf less essential. It is possible that Rebecca comes from a region where wearing a scarf is considered unnecessary due to warmer temperatures or different cultural practices. Another factor influencing their fashion choices could be their personal styles and aesthetics. Felicia might find that a scarf adds a touch of sophistication and elegance to her outfit, while Rebecca might consider her look complete without one. Felicia possibly enjoys experimenting with different types of scarves, experimenting with various folding techniques or patterns, highlighting her creativity and passion for fashion. Rebecca, in contrast, might lean towards minimalism when it comes to her wardrobe, appreciating the simplicity and ease of getting dressed without having to worry about coordinating her ensemble with a scarf. For Rebecca, her personal style reflects her preference for unencumbered aesthetics or functionality. Moreover, wearing or not wearing a scarf could also be influenced by their social circle, with friends encouraging each other's fashion choices or even participating in trends and challenges on social media. Felicia might have friends who love wearing scarves, encouraging her focus on following those trends, while Rebecca might be exposed to influencers on social media who promote a more simplistic approach to style. This friendly and subtle competition or camaraderie between Felicia and Rebecca can also contribute to what influences their decisions to wear specific accessories like a scarf. In conclusion, Felicia goes out wearing a scarf but Rebecca does not mainly because of the multitude of factors that shape their preferences, beliefs, and perspective on the matter. Personal experiences, upbringing, fashion sense, and individual tastes all play a role in their decisions on whether to incorporate a scarf into their daily wardrobe. The fact that they have differing opinions on wearing scarves showcases the diversity and individuality prevalent among humans. In all aspects of life, such differences should be celebrated, and we should appreciate everyone's unique choices, no matter how big or small those preferences may be."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's break it down: 1. Premise: \\"oh that's the cheerleader thing\\" This statement suggests that someone has recognized something as being connected to or characteristic of cheerleading. It could be an activity, an outfit, a performance, or even an attitude that is typical of cheerleaders or cheerleading culture. The speaker has acknowledged the connection between the observed item or behavior and cheerleading. 2. Hypothesis: \\"That's related to cheerleaders, right?\\" This statement is a question that seeks confirmation of the relationship between the observed item or behavior and cheerleading. The speaker may not be completely certain about the connection or may simply wish to corroborate their understanding with others. By comparing the given premise and hypothesis, we can observe the following: - Both statements acknowledge the presence of an item or behavior related to cheerleading. - The premise demonstrates an understanding or identification of the observed item or behavior as a \\"cheerleader thing.\\" - The hypothesis questions the relationship and seeks confirmation. Considering the context and information in both statements, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis \\"That's related to cheerleaders, right?\\" aligns with the premise \\"oh that's the cheerleader thing\\" and is likely to be true. However, it is essential to note that, without additional information or context, we cannot definitively confirm the truth of the hypothesis.

In 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-Lüneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV.

Venice had held several islands in the Aegean and the Ionian seas, together with strategically positioned forts along the coast of the Greek mainland since the carving up of the Byzantine Empire after the Fourth Crusade. However, with the rise of the Ottomans, during the 16th and early 17th centuries, they lost most of these, such as Cyprus and Euboea  to the Turks. Between 1645 and 1669, the Venetians and the Ottomans fought a long and costly war over the last major Venetian possession in the Aegean, Crete. During this war, the Venetian commander, Francesco Morosini, came into contact with the rebellious Maniots, for a joint campaign in the Morea. In 1659, Morosini landed in the Morea, and together with the Maniots, he took Kalamata. However, he was soon after forced to return to Crete, and the Peloponnesian venture failed. In 1683, a new war broke out between Austria and the Ottomans, with a large Ottoman army advancing towards Vienna. In response to this, a Holy League was formed. After the Ottoman army was defeated in the Battle of Vienna, the Venetians decided to use the opportunity of the weakening of Ottoman power and its distraction in the Danubian front so as to reconquer its lost territories in the Aegean and Dalmatia. On 25 April 1684, the Most Serene Republic declared war on the Ottomans. Aware that she would have to rely on her own strength for success, Venice prepared for the war by securing financial and military aid in men and ships from the Knights of Malta, the Duchy of Savoy, the Papal States, and the Knights of St. Stephen.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. After the end of this story, did Trump probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. not enough information  B.

He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto..., can you guess it ?

Progressive organizations such as Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) and Media Matters for America (MMfA) have criticized Stossel's work, for what they perceived as a lack of balance of coverage and distortion of facts. For example, Stossel was criticized for a segment on his October 11, 1999, show during which he argued that AIDS research has received too much funding, \\"25 times more than on Parkinson's, which kills more people.\\" FAIR responded that AIDS had killed more people in the United States in 1999, but Stossel was speaking in more broad terms than a single country over a single year.  In a February 2000 Salon.com feature on Stossel entitled \\"Prime-time propagandist\\", David Mastio wrote that Stossel has a conflict of interest in donating profits from his public speaking engagements to, among others, a non-profit called \\"Stossel in the Classroom\\" which includes material for use in schools, some of which uses material made by Stossel.  University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith has alleged that Stossel, in his September 1999 special Is America #1?, used an out-of-context clip of Galbraith to convey the notion that Galbraith advocated the adoption by Europe of the free market economics practiced by the United States, when in fact Galbraith actually advocated that Europe adopt some of the United States' social benefit transfer mechanisms such as Social Security, which is the economically opposite view. Stossel denied any misrepresentation of Galbraith's views and stated that it was not his intention to convey that Galbraith agreed with all of the special's ideas. However, he re-edited that portion of the program for its September 2000 repeat, in which Stossel paraphrased, \\"Even economists who like Europe's policies, like James Galbraith, now acknowledge America's success.\\" Answer this question \\"Who was criticising him?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) and Media Matters for America (MMfA) were criticizing him."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two cousins were fascinated about food chains in nature. Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores.  Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","output":"Fox learned less about predators with no natural predators. In the given paragraph, Liam and Fox explored different aspects of food chains in nature. Liam focused on apex predators, which are described as predators at the top of a food chain with no natural predators. On the other hand, Fox concentrated on grazers and large herbivores - animals which are usually lower in the food chain and often serve as prey for apex predators like wolves. Because Liam specifically studied apex predators, which have no natural predators, he gained more knowledge about these types of animals in comparison to Fox, who focused on grazers and large herbivores.

You can try using vocal commands with your horse, but they work best when a horse has come to associate those words/sounds with a complementary action. However, some words (like \\"woah,\\" \\"easy,\\" and \\"back\\") are easily understood by horses due to frequent exposure.  If you want your horse to respond to a verbal command like \\"faster,\\" you'll need to train your horse by saying \\"faster\\" while you squeeze or gently kick the horse's sides. Be aware of your tone of voice. The tone you speak in is at least as important as the actual words you say to your horse. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, the article explains that your pelvis rocks forward and backward in synch with your horse's movements as it moves, and by adjusting your pelvic movements, you can influence the horse's speed.

He converces schizophrenically with himself via tape recordings of his own voice. He is also being hounded by Randy (Pier Luigi Conti), a shady loan shark whom he owes money to after accruing bad gambling debts.Lester picks up a certain Maggie MacDonald (Sasha Darwin), an obnoxious, hysterical, mustached, sexually frustrated alcoholic, whom he invites over at his house for dinner. His attempt to poison her is thwarted because she is already so drunk when she arrives at his place that she spills her glass of wine onto the floor. On the next attempt, she giddily mixed up his glass of wine with hers. He finally loses patience on the third try when she swallows the poisoned glassful, only to vomit before it can take effect. As Maggie excuses herself to the bathroom to clean up, he attacks her with a wooden stick. Her scalp splits apart and she runs screaming from the bathroom with blood streaming down her face. He chases her down the corridor bashing her head repeatedly, causing skin to rip away from her face, and a single bloodshot eyeball to roll out of her right eye socket onto the floor.Playing dead for a few seconds, Maggie rises when Parson's back is turned and makes another mad dash for the front door, but is rounded up and punched unconscious. Furious and exhausted, the killer shoves her head into a over and switches it on, leaving her slumped with her flesh slowly melting off her face. Dead at last, Parson shoves Maggie's body into the trunk of his Mercedes. But he has to chop off the corpse's feet to get the body to fit right.When Parson ditches the body at a construction site, he is observed by a local tramp (Marco Di Stefano), who proceeds to attempt to blackmail Parson. Not to be deterred, he follows the derelict as he leaves. Catching up with him on a long stretch of country road, Parson puts his foot on the gas...

There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \\"Hook her up,\\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond.

Maira Elizabeth and Andrew Nari An undated photo of Maira Elizabeth Nari and her father, Andrew Nari, the chief stweard aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370.      It was midnight when Maira Elizabeth Nari scrolled through her Twitter feed and saw the news: A piece of an airplane wing had washed ashore on an island in the Indian Ocean. Home with her mother watching television at the time, Nari had “mixed feelings,” she says. For nearly a year and a half, she had held out hope that her father, the chief steward on the Malaysia Airlines flight that vanished last year, could still be alive, perhaps “stranded somewhere,” she says. The rusty bit of wing, covered in barnacles from the sea, meant her dad might not be coming home.      Nari, a 19-year-old college student studying communications in Malaysia, had been sending notes to her father, Andrew Nari, on Twitter and Instagram ever since his disappearance, telling him she was waiting for him. In one early tweet, she wrote, “Daddy. It’s almost 24 hours. When will you be back home? I’ll be waiting, all of us are. Goodnight, daddy.” At Christmas, she wrote on Instagram, “I love you, daddy. Have a blessed Christmas with the rest of the crew and passengers.” A few months later, she wrote, “I miss you, and I’ll wait for you. Even if you’re not gonna come home, that’s okay. Because I know, you’re waiting for us to join you. Wait for me, daddy. Up there, we’ll do things that we never get to do.”      Her love notes to her dad captured the attention of the world—she now has has more than 92,000 followers on Twitter and more than 23,000 on Instagram. “It feels good to know that people actually care for you,” she says, describing Twitter as “like a diary to me.” At the same time, she says, “it is so weird to have the attention. It’s like people are watching whatever you tweet, and you have to be careful.”      One tweet caught the eye of the Liverpool Football Club in England: “Daddy, Liverpool is winning the game. Come home, so you can watch the game! You never miss watching the game.” Last month, the team’s manager, captain, and a former star met with her near Kuala Lumpur, where she attends college. “I was so happy and excited to meet them,” she says. “My dad has been a Liverpool fan for so many years, even before he met my mother.”      Just days later came the news of the wing. “I don’t know what I felt at that time,” she says, adding that part of her hoped the debris was from the plane and part of her hoped it wasn’t. All of her family had maintained hope that her father had survived, she says, ever since Flight MH370 vanished from the radar on March 8, 2014, while traveling from Malaysia to China with 239 people on board. Until the wing fragment washed up, no debris from the Boeing 777 had been found. For family and friends of the passengers, the unsolved mystery left room for hope that their loved ones were still alive, perhaps the victims of a hijacking.      Nari and her mother and brother spent an anxious few days waiting to hear if the debris was indeed from the flight. Nari was asleep when Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak made the predawn announcement last week: Experts had concluded that the debris was from the plane, he said. Nari saw the news on Twitter when she awoke, and began to cry.      Other international investigators did not immediately confirm the findings in Malaysia, calling for more analysis. The mixed messages reportedly caused confusion and frustration among friends and relatives of people on the flight. In China, relatives of Chinese passengers protested outside the Malaysia Airlines offices in Beijing. Family members also went to the Boeing offices in Beijing, demanding a briefing on the wing fragment. On a Facebook page devoted to an American passenger, Philip Wood, a commenter wrote, “This is yet another piece of circumstantial evidence. Still, no proof.”      Nari says her family is also confused and frustrated, and she is unsure if the debris is from the plane or not. She says she doesn’t know if she’ll ever have answers about what happened to the flight. As for the investigators, she says, she is “being very positive that they are trying their best.” She says the relatives of other passengers are like family now.      Two weeks before Nari’s father went missing, he celebrated his birthday with his wife and kids. Nari used her first-ever paycheck from a job as a hostess at a hotel to buy him a birthday cake and a portable power bank to charge his devices. “He always wanted to get himself a power bank,” she says. When he opened the gift box, she says, “he smiled from ear to ear.” She recalls how her father told her to “study hard so that I have a good future.” He said she could have a boyfriend only after she finished her degree. “Oops,” she says, “I broke the rule.”      She said goodbye to her dad on the night of the fateful flight, as he headed out the door to drive to the airport with her mother and brother. Her father had worked with the airline for 25 years, and her mother had worked there for a time too, she says, serving as a flight attendant. Nari, tired that night from a long day of work at the hotel, told her dad she would see him when he returned.      She was at work the next day when a colleague said a plane had gone missing. She called her mother and learned the unthinkable news. “I was out of my mind,” she says of her grief. “I wasn’t thinking straight. All I did was cry for few days. I didn’t eat at all. I fell asleep crying the whole time. It took me a week to actually get back on track to think properly.”      She says she gradually began to heal with the help of her Catholic faith and a belief that she needed to stay strong for her family. “I was thinking about my mother and my brother. I’m the eldest, so I thought, I should take care of them and that they need me. So I had to be strong and positive,” she says. “But I am thankful, we all made it through.”      Expressing her emotions on Twitter also helped, she says. “At that time, I didn’t know who to tell about what I feel and think. On Twitter, you can tweet whatever you want without what others may think.” She adds, “Well, that was last year,” before she attracted followers from around the world. “Now everyone has their eyes on me.” Sometimes people send negative comments, for instance suggesting that the flight crew was to blame. “At first I felt really sad about it, but then I got used to it,” she says. “So I ignore all the negative comments and be positive.”      In the meantime, her father visits her in her dreams. In a poignant note last November, eight months to the day after her dad disappeared, she wrote on Instagram, “Daddy, few days ago you came to see me. It was the funniest dream, but hey! Thank you for stopping by.” She went on to describe her recent dream of a busy morning, taking a shower and checking text messages on her phone. “Suddenly I feel like I had to look up, and I saw you standing at the stairs looking at me and your smile…your ear to ear smile. You said, ‘I’m home.'” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Article: Parents are often amazed at how fast their child grows and develops. New research has determined that the ability to quantify may develop much sooner than most parents realize. Kristy vanMarle, professor of the University of Missouri, has determined that contrary to what previous studies have shown, infants are able to quantify substances --like sand or water--as early as 10 months. As long as the difference between the two substances is large enough, infants will choose the larger amount, especially when it comes to food. With the assistance of her team researchers, vanMarle tested the quantifying skills of babies by presenting them with two cups: one containing a small amount of food, and one containing a larger amount. Consistently, the babies chose the larger amount. \\"Several studies throughout the last 15 years have shown that infants are very good at telling how many objects they see; however, infants don't seem to count things like water or sand,\\" vanMarle said. \\"What we're saying is that they can quantify substances; The infants can see how much food goes into each cup and compare that in their memories. They decide which amount is larger, and they almost always select the larger one.\\" This information further refutes the long-held idea that babies \\"know nothing of the world,\\" vanMarle said. \\"Since psychologists have begun studying infants with sensitive measures, we've discovered a lot of early abilities. I think for parents, it should be exciting to know that there's somebody there that has some fundamental and basic knowledge of the world, and that knowledge is guiding their development,\\" vanMarle said. In the future, vanMarle says this kind of study could be linked to a child's progress in math-related skills, although programs marketed to increase those abilities, such as \\"Baby Einstein,\\" still have mixed reviews when it comes to academic study.

Before you begin tamping or even pouring the concrete, you'll need to have forms in place. Nail together a series of boards to fit the area you'll be concreting, dividing the different sections as needed. Choose your answer from: 1). Trace the lines of the forms together using a landscape ruler or pencil to create the trowel lines. Polyurethane or kevlar is a weak material, but for concrete that's not waterproof, use a moisture-retaining compound like sandstone. 2). You can find formwork templates at a hardware store or online. Break the concrete into blocks and joints. 3). When you run out of boards, lay a tarp down to protect the concrete rather than covering it completely. Use drywall screws to secure your forms in place. 4). Use a level to make sure the surface comes out perfectly flat. Formwork structures serve to mark the perimeter of the concrete surface and contain the wet concrete mix while it's being spread and compacted.","output":"After constructing your formwork, it's crucial to ensure the surface is even and well-prepared for the concrete pouring process - this is where using a level comes into play. By utilizing a level, you can guarantee that the surface comes out perfectly flat, providing a stable and well-aligned base for the concrete. In addition to marking out the perimeter of the intended concrete surface, the formwork structures also play a vital role in containing the wet concrete mix as it is spread and compacted. This ultimately helps in achieving a uniform, properly shaped, and structurally sound final product that meets the project's requirements. Not only does proper leveling and formwork contribute to the stability of the concrete structure, but it also enhances its durability and overall appearance, making for a more polished and professional result.

Write a title for this article: New York City’s public school students showed large gains on state math tests this year, particularly in the middle school grades, and black and Hispanic students continued to edge closer to their white counterparts, the city and state education departments announced on Monday. In New York City, 82 percent of students in Grades 3 through 8 passed the test, compared with 74 percent last year and just 57 percent three years ago. Statewide, 86 percent of students passed the test, compared with 81 percent last year. The results, coupled with similar gains on English tests released last month, were a boon for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is lobbying Albany to keep control of city schools in the mayor’s hands. At a news conference at a school in the Bronx, Mr. Bloomberg trumpeted the results as evidence that mayoral control had produced revolutionary improvements and brought city students within spitting distance of state averages after years of mediocrity. “Our reforms are working,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “Our schools are heading in the right direction.” New York was not, however, the only urban school system to register large gains. Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers and Syracuse showed similar increases. Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the state’s Board of Regents, said there was reason for caution amid the impressive results. She said that the tests had become too predictable, and that the state was considering raising the scores required to pass next year. “Just because scores have gone up dramatically does not mean that our youngsters are ready to go to college,” Dr. Tisch said at a news conference in Albany. She said the results in New York City showed “positive, strong movement in a right direction.” But she pointed out that 74 percent of public school graduates need remedial education in English and math when they enter the City University of New York. “No one should interpret this as an enormous victory,” Dr. Tisch said. Mr. Bloomberg and his schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, disputed that characterization, pointing to what they described as ground-breaking results: for instance, that the achievement gap between city students and their state counterparts had been cut in half over the past three years and is now 7 percentage points. There was also evidence that the gap among students of different races was narrowing in a city whose public school students are more than 70 percent black or Hispanic. Black students, for instance, trailed white students by 17 percentage points this year, on average, compared with 31 points in 2006. And middle school students, whose performance the city has historically struggled to improve, showed large gains. For example, 71 percent of eighth graders passed the test this year, compared with 60 percent last year. The students’ average scores on the tests, often cited by testing experts as a better measure of progress on tests, showed an 8-point increase in the city, to 680, compared with 6 points statewide, to 684. Test scores range from the upper 400s to upper 700s, with 650 considered passing. Mr. Klein said in an interview that the results marked a milestone in his reform efforts and showed that urban districts with large numbers of disadvantaged students could compete with their better-off counterparts. “This is a big victory for the city, and we should really bask in it,” he said, adding that he supported the call to develop national standards. Even Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers’ union, lavished praise on the mayor and his chancellor. “What we’ve seen in the last seven years is a cohesion and a stability and resources that we did not have beforehand,” she said. But several scholars cautioned against viewing the scores as evidence of dramatic change. Michael J. Petrilli, a vice president at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute in Washington, an educational research organization, said the numbers most likely reflected a pattern that has emerged in cities that have implemented high-stakes testing programs. “This is mostly about educators getting used to the exams, rather than some sort of intervention having a big impact,” he said. Mr. Petrilli said claims that the achievement gap was narrowing needed to be weighed against the fact that in many cases, the scores of white students have reached a plateau, making gains by black and Hispanic students appear more significant than they might actually be. Daniel Koretz, a Harvard professor of education and an expert on testing, said it was important to consider the possibility of score inflation. David W. Chen, Robert Gebeloff and Kenny Porpora contributed reporting.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Cimino was born in New York City on February 3, 1939. A third-generation Italian-American, Cimino and his brothers grew up with their parents in Old Westbury, Long Island. He was regarded as a prodigy at the private schools his parents sent him to, but rebelled as an adolescent by consorting with delinquents, getting into fights, and coming home drunk. Of this time, Cimino described himself as \\"always hanging around with kids my parents didn't approve of. Interviews with Cimino were rare; he declined all interviews with American journalists for 10 years following Heaven's Gate and he gave his part in the making of that film little discussion. George Hickenlooper's book Reel Conversations and Peter Biskind's highly critical book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls deal with the film and resulting scandal. Hickenlooper's book includes one of the few candid discussions with Cimino; Biskind focuses on events during and after the production as a later backdrop for the sweeping changes made to Hollywood and the movie brat generation. Steven Bach, a former UA studio executive, wrote Final Cut (1985), which describes in detail how Heaven's Gate brought down United Artists. Cimino called Bach's book a \\"work of fiction\\" by a \\"degenerate who never even came on the set\\". However, Bach's work does discuss times in which he did appear at the shooting location to confront Cimino about the budgetary issues.  While Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Francis Ford Coppola, Gene Hackman, Sidney Lumet and Robert De Niro all gave interviews for the 2009 John Cazale documentary I Knew It Was You, Cimino refused to do so.  However, the European DVD release of The Deer Hunter contains an audio commentary with Cimino as does the American DVD release of Year of the Dragon.  In 2011, the French movie critic Jean-Baptiste Thoret wrote a large profile on Michael Cimino for Les Cahiers du Cinema. Cimino appeared on the cover.  In 2013, Thoret published in France an acclaimed book, Michael Cimino, les voix perdues de l'Amerique (lost voices of America). Flammarion.

Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries.

These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.  - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.  - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication.

Holy wells were frequently pagan sacred sites that later became Christianized. The term \\"holy well\\" is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the folklore of the area where it is located, whether in the form of a particular name, an associated legend, the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the numinous presence of its guardian spirit or Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the hagiography of Celtic saints.  - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties.

Their analysis is summarized in the October print issue of Neuropharmacology.      \\"We want to initiate the conversation now as to how to classify psilocybin to facilitate its path to the clinic and minimize logistical hurdles in the future,\\" says Matthew W. Johnson, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \\"We expect these final clearance trials to take place in the next five years or so.\\"      Medical marijuana A sea change in CBD drug policy? Hopkins experts discuss the DEA's recent decision to schedule a marijuana-derived epilepsy medication as a Schedule V drug, making it the first federally-sanctioned compound derived from the cannabis plant      Following the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, any drug with the potential for abuse is categorized based on criteria that take into account whether the drug has accepted medical use, and its safety and the potential for abuse. Schedule IV drugs are those that have a low potential for abuse or dependence.      Although preliminary research studies suggest that psilocybin may be effective for smoking cessation and for disorders such as cancer-specific depression and anxiety, it must clear phase III clinical trials before the Food and Drug Administration can be petitioned to reclassify it.      Studies in animals and humans both show low potential for abuse, the researchers say. When rats push a lever to receive psilocybin, they don't keep pushing the lever like they do for drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, or heroin. When it comes to human studies, people who have used psilocybin typically report using it a few times across their lifetime.      When rats push a lever to receive psilocybin, they don't keep pushing the lever like they do for drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, or heroin.      As for safety, studies show it frequently falls at the end of the scales with the least harm to users and society, say the researchers. Psilocybin also is lowest in the potential for lethal overdose as there is no known overdose level.      \\"We should be clear that psilocybin is not without risks of harm, which are greater in recreational than medical settings, but relatively speaking, looking at other drugs both legal and illegal, it comes off as being the least harmful in different surveys and across different countries,\\" says Johnson.      Although psilocybin is relatively less harmful than other drugs and not prone to compulsive abuse, the researchers don't recommend releasing psilocybin into patients' hands even with a prescription. \\"We believe that the conditions should be tightly controlled and that when taken for a clinical reason, it should be administered in a health care setting, monitored by a person trained for that situation,\\" says Johnson. The researchers foresee that the process for psilocybin use in the clinic would be similar to how an anesthesiologist prescribes and administers a drug, minimizing the potential for abuse or harm. ||||| Researchers at Johns Hopkins University hope to eventually reclassify psilocybin from a schedule I to schedule IV drug, according to a news release from the research institution.      Psilocybin is the psychedelic drug that puts the “magic” in mushrooms. The hallucinogenic drug has been shown to offer therapeutics benefits such as alleviating symptoms of depression and helping people to quit smoking, for example.      But despite some proven clinical uses, psilocybin is still classified as a schedule I drug, which means it is classified as having no medical use and high potential for abuse and addiction. By contrast, schedule IV drugs, which include such controlled substances as sleep aids, have a low potential for abuse or dependence.      But before the Food and Drug Administration can be petitioned to reclassify it, psilocybin first has to clear phase III clinical trials. The entire process is expected to take about five years.      That isn’t to say that once cleared, psilocybin should be available for prescription use and placed directly into the hands of patients. “We believe that the conditions should be tightly controlled and that when taken for a clinical reason, it should be administered in a health care setting, monitored by a person trained for that situation,” explained Matthew W. Johnson, a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences.      Johnson is the lead author on the study about reclassifying psilocybin, published in the October 2018 issue of the journal Neuropharmacology.      Psilocybin is found in more than 200 varieties of mushrooms and has gained growing acceptance in the medical community in recent years for treating depression.      That increased acceptance has also garnered some interest from venture capital. Investor Peter Thiel has stakes in companies using magic mushrooms to treat depression to the general public and has suggested that psychedelics were the next big bet for investors hoping to cash in on cutting edge new therapies. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Johns Hopkins researchers have suggested that if psilocybin, the psychoactive component in hallucinogenic mushrooms, clears phase III clinical trials, it should be re-categorized from a schedule I drug with no known medical potential to a schedule IV drug, like prescription sleep aids, but with tighter control. Preliminary research has indicated that psilocybin may be effective for smoking cessation, cancer-specific depression, and anxiety. Researchers believe it should be administered in a healthcare setting with strict monitoring to minimize the potential for abuse or harm. The process of reclassification is expected to take around five years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose palace was El Greco obliged to leave? ?  By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that \\"he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint\\". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a \\"foolish foreigner\\", and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and... Answer:","output":"El Greco was obliged to leave the palace of Farnese."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Endogamy is the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group, class, or social group, rejecting others on such a basis as being unsuitable for marriage or for other close personal relationships.  - Caste is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, status in a hierarchy, and customary social interaction and exclusion. Its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today. However, the economic significance of the caste system in India has been declining as a result of urbanization and affirmative action programs. A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Indian caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India. The term is also applied to non-human populations like ants and bees.  - The Pasi are one of the untouchable communities ( or dalits ) who are now classified as a Scheduled Caste under modern India 's system of positive discrimination . As untouchables , they were traditionally considered outside the Hindu ritual ranking system of castes known as varna . They live in the northern Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh .  - Social stratification is a society's categorization of people into socioeconomic strata, based upon their occupation and income, wealth and social status, or derived power (social and political). As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or social unit. In modern Western societies, social stratification typically is distinguished as three social classes: (i) the upper class, (ii) the middle class, and (iii) the lower class; in turn, each class can be subdivided into strata, e.g. the upper-stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum. Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of kinship or caste, or both.  - The caste system in India is the paradigmatic ethnographic example of caste. It has origins in ancient India, and was transformed by various ruling elites in medieval, early-modern, and, modern India, especially the Mughal Empire and the British Raj. It is today the basis of educational and job reservations in India. It consists of two different concepts, \\"varna\\" and \\"jti\\", which may be regarded as different levels of analysis of this system.  - Affirmative action (known as reservation in India and Nepal and positive discrimination in the UK; also known in a narrower context as employment equity in Canada and South Africa) is the policy of favoring members of a disadvantaged group who suffer or have suffered from discrimination within a culture. Often, these people are disadvantaged for historical reasons, such as oppression or slavery. Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances. The nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region. Some countries, such as India, use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group. In some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes.    What is the relationship between 'pasi ' and 'ethnic group'?","output":"The Pasi community is an ethnic group in the Indian subcontinent, mainly residing in the northern Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. As mentioned, they are classified as a Scheduled Caste under India's system of positive discrimination. The relationship between the Pasi community and the concept of an ethnic group can be understood by looking at various aspects of culture, identity, and social organization. An ethnic group, broadly defined, is a category of people who identify with each other based on shared cultural, ancestral, linguistic, social, or national experiences. In the case of the Pasi community, they share a common history, cultural practices, social norms, and rituals that make them a distinct ethnic group within the larger Indian social framework. One key aspect of the Pasi community's ethnic identity is their historical status as one of the \\"untouchable\\" communities or Dalits within the Indian caste system. As untouchables, they were traditionally considered outside the Hindu ritual ranking system of castes known as varna. This social exclusion and marginalization have played a significant role in shaping the collective identity of the Pasi community. The caste system in India is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, meaning individuals are expected to marry within their own caste or social group. This practice further reinforces the group's shared identity and cultural practices. The Pasi community's status as a Scheduled Caste under India's affirmative action policies is an effort to address and alleviate the historical discrimination and social exclusion they have faced due to their caste and untouchable status. In summary, the Pasi community's relationship with the concept of an ethnic group involves their shared history, cultural practices, social norms, and rituals, which have been shaped by their status within the Indian caste system and social stratification. As an ethnic group, the Pasi have a distinct identity that is recognized and addressed through modern policies to foster social inclusion, positive discrimination, and the provision of opportunities for education, employment, and political representation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

Q: Which competition leads to one species going extinct or both becoming more specialized?   A: Answer:","output":"The competition that leads to one species going extinct or both species becoming more specialized is known as interspecific competition. Interspecific competition is a critical component of the ecological interactions between different species sharing the same resources within a community. In this type of competition, two or more species compete for limited resources such as space, food, water, or light, which may significantly impact their survival and reproductive rates. Interspecific competition is an essential force driving the process of evolution and specialization of species. When two species have similar requirements and preferences within an ecosystem, they may begin to compete against each other, which can eventually lead to several potential outcomes: 1. Competitive Exclusion: One species may become better adapted at utilizing the available resources and gaining a competitive advantage over the other, leading to the extinction of the less competitive species. This principle is known as the \\"competitive exclusion principle\\" or Gause's Law, named after the Russian biologist Georgy Gause. In this case, two species that occupy the same niche cannot coexist over time, and one will eventually outcompete and displace the other. 2. Niche Partitioning: If both competing species can adapt and specialize in their resource usage and preferences, they may be able to coexist within the same ecosystem, avoiding direct competition. For instance, species may differ in their feeding habits, habitat preference, reproductive patterns, or temporal activities. Each species will occupy a different or narrower niche, thereby reducing or avoiding competition. In this scenario, both species will evolve and adapt to separate microhabitats reducing their competition and potential negative effects on each other. For instance, two bird species with distinct beak size and shape may feed on different-sized seeds, thus avoiding direct competition and allowing them to coexist without the need to outcompete one another. 3. Character Displacement: Over time, species may undergo evolutionarily changes that result in different physical or behavioral traits that minimize the overlap between their niches, allowing them to coexist within the same environment. This phenomenon is known as \\"character displacement,\\" where species diverge in their morphological or ecological traits when competing for the same resources. For example, two species of lizards living on the same island may develop separate eating habits and exhibit different body sizes, enabling them to utilize different resources and reduce competition. Interspecific competition is an essential process in ecology, as it influences critical aspects of community structure, species diversity, and evolutionary processes. By driving adaptation, specialization, and ultimately species evolution, interspecific competition plays a significant role in shaping the patterns of biodiversity across the world's ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The app allows me to view time, date, and notifications on the lock screen without having to unlock my phone. It works well most of the time, but I've experienced a few glitches in which the screen would not turn off automatically, draining my battery, or when notifications aren't cleared upon dismissing them. One of the major drawbacks is higher battery usage. I noticed a significant decrease in my battery life after installing AcDisplay, which might be a problem for users looking to maximize productivity. Another issue I encountered is the app's compatibility with other lock screen apps and security measures. I had to try disabling my lock screen password for AcDisplay to work without clashing with security. It would be great if the developers could find a way to fix this and make the app more compatible with other security measures set on the device. Overall, com.achep.acdisplay has a lot of potential, but it needs improvements in battery efficiency and compatibility with other lock screen or security features. With those fixes, I believe this app could easily become a 4 or even a 5-star application.

The earliest human remains found on the island of Sri Lanka date to about 35,000 years ago . The proto-historical period begins roughly in the 3rd century, based on chronicles like the Mahavamsa, Dipavamsa, and the Culavamsa. The earliest documents of settlement in the Island are found in these chronicles. These chronicles cover the period since the establishment of the Kingdom of Tambapanni in the 6th century BCE. The first Sri Lankan ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Pandukabhaya, is recorded for the 4th century BCE. Buddhism was introduced in the 3rd century BCE by Arhath Mahinda . The first Tamil ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Ellalan, an invader, is recorded for the 2nd century BCE. The island was divided into numerous kingdoms over the following centuries, intermittently  united under Chola rule. Sri Lanka was ruled by 181 monarchs from the Anuradhapura to Kandy periods.From the 16th century, some coastal areas of the country were also controlled  by the Portuguese, Dutch and British.Between 1597 and 1658, a substantial part  of the island was under Portuguese rule. The Portuguese lost their possessions in Ceylon due to Dutch intervention in the Eighty Years' War. Following the Kandyan Wars, the island was united under British rule in 1815.Armed uprisings against the British took place in the 1818 Uva Rebellion and the 1848 Matale Rebellion. Independence was finally granted in 1948 but the country remained a Dominion of the British Empire until 1972. In 1972 Sri Lanka assumed the status of a Republic. A constitution was introduced in 1978 which made the Executive President the head of state. The Sri Lankan Civil War began in 1983, including an armed youth uprising in 1971 and 1987-1989, with the 25-year-long civil war ending in 2009. Answer this question: How many years were there between the Uva Rebellion and the Matale Rebellion?","output":"To calculate the number of years between the Uva Rebellion and the Matale Rebellion, we need to find the difference between the years in which these events took place. The Uva Rebellion occurred in 1818, and the Matale Rebellion took place in 1848. The difference between these years is: 1848 (year of Matale Rebellion) - 1818 (year of Uva Rebellion) = 30 years. So, there were 30 years between the Uva Rebellion and the Matale Rebellion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Summarize: Tight, structured clothing and shoes may make you uncomfortable when you travel. They may also increase your risk of developing blood clots. Instead, wear something loose that fits you comfortably. Opt for stretchy pants with an elastic waistline and a loose fitting top, or wear a loose-fitting jersey or cotton dress. Pair your outfit with a pair of comfortable walking shoes, such as sneakers or supportive sandals. You may also want to dress in layers to help keep yourself at a comfortable temperature. For example, you could wear a short-sleeved top with a cardigan or pullover. That way if you feel a chill, you can simply throw on your cardigan. Buckle your seatbelt when you are going to be riding in a car, on a bus, or on an airplane. Make sure that the seatbelt is low around your hips and positioned under your belly. The top strap of a car seatbelt should go across your chest and be positioned above your belly. On an airplane, keep your seatbelt buckled even when the “fasten seatbelt” sign is off. Unexpected turbulence may jostle you around and could even cause injury if you’re out of your seat during severe turbulence. If you will be driving, position yourself as far away from the steering wheel as you can while still being able to fully operate your vehicle. Take some extra time to get adjusted and make sure that your position is both comfortable and safe. If you put your seat all the way back and it is hard for you to reach the steering wheel, you need to be closer to it. Don’t put yourself in unsafe positions just to create more distance between you and the wheel. Gas-producing foods can increase your discomfort while traveling, so it is best to avoid them while you’re in transit. To be extra careful, limit your consumptions of these foods up to 24 hours before you leave too. That helps keep any side-effects caused by last night’s dinner from derailing your morning flight plans.   Steer clear of carbonated beverages, beans, prunes, and any other food or drink that you know will make you gassy. For example, if eating raw vegetables gives you gas, then avoid eating raw vegetables until you reach your destination.","output":"When traveling, wear loose, comfortable clothing and shoes to reduce discomfort and the risk of blood clots.

Jehovah's Witnesses children at risk: RC Children are not adequately protected from sexual abuse in the Jehovah's Witnesses, an organisation that wrongly relies on a rule with 2000-year-old biblical origins when handling complaints, the royal commission says. It also says victims may face an impossible choice between staying in an organisation that protects their abuser or being \\"shunned\\" and cut off from family and friends. \\"We do not consider the Jehovah's Witness organisation to be an organisation which responds adequately to child sexual abuse,\\" the sex abuse royal commission said in a report released on Monday. \\"We do not believe that children are adequately protected from the risk of sexual abuse.\\" The commission said the Jehovah's Witness organisation's scripturally-based policies and practices were outdated and, by and large, wholly inappropriate and unsuitable in child sex abuse cases. It applied a two-witness rule for complaints of wrongdoing that had not been revised or improved since the Jehovah's Witnesses was founded in the late 19th century. \\"The Jehovah's Witness organisation relies on, and applies inflexibly even in the context of child sexual abuse, a rule which was devised more than 2000 years ago,\\" the report said. \\"A complainant of child sexual abuse whose allegation has not been corroborated by confession by their abuser or a second 'credible' eyewitness is necessarily disempowered and subjected to ongoing traumatisation.\\" To put a victim of child sex abuse in such a position was unacceptable and wrong, the commission said. The commission found the organisation's internal sanctions are weak and leave perpetrators of child sexual abuse at large in the organisation and the community. The organisation deals with offenders through assessing how repentant they are, with inadequate regard to the risk of reoffending, the commission said. That showed a serious lack of understanding of the nature and impact of child sex abuse and and placed children within the organisation at significant risk of sexual abuse, it said. The commission said the practice of shunning those who leave the Jehovah's Witnesses could put victims in the untenable position of having to choose between constant re-traumatisation through sharing a community with their abuser or losing their entire family and social network. The commission found the Jehovah's Witnesses' general practice was not to report child sex abuse allegations to police or authorities unless required to do so by law, saying there was no evidence they reported a single one of 1006 alleged abusers. However, the Jehovah's Witnesses said they comply with mandatory reporting laws and will report abuse allegations to the authorities if the child is in danger, regardless of reporting requirements. \\"In addition to whatever action is taken by the authorities, Jehovah's Witnesses document and act upon any allegation of child abuse received, and provide pastoral care to a victim and their family,\\" the organisation told AAP. It said the commission's recommendations related to responses from decades ago and the Jehovah's Witnesses continued to refine and improve their responses. \\"Although the commission questioned certain Bible-based beliefs and standards, senior Jehovah's Witnesses testified that the organisation will continue to review its responses.\\" The religion never takes custody of children and does not sponsor any activities or programs that separate children from their parents or guardians at any time, it said. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The Australian Royal Commission accuses the Jehovah's Witnesses organisation of inadequate response and failure to protect children from sexual abuse. The commission claims the religious group's handling of sexual abuse complaints is based on outdated scripturally-based policies, requiring corroboration of the abuse claims either by confession from the abuser or a second 'credible' eyewitness. This practise is not only traumatising but also effectively shields abusers within the organisation. Furthermore, victims face a harsh choice between staying with the organisation that shelters abusers or leaving and being shunned by their community. Although the Jehovah's Witnesses organisation insists they comply with mandatory reporting laws in relation to abuse, the commission found no evidence of them reporting any one of 1006 alleged abusers. The organisation defends its practices and asserts that it has been improving its responses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Two countries had big rivers discharging in the same ocean. Finland was very aware of environmental pollution and acted accordingly, while Russian practiced conventional agriculture and used fertilizers.  Which country caused less human waste to reach into the ocean?  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. A:","output":"To answer the question, we need to compare the waste production and management practices in both Finland and Russia.  Step 1: Consider Environmental Awareness and Practices Finland is known for its environmental awareness and regulations. This means they are likely to have better waste management practices, including the proper treatment of sewage and agricultural waste to minimize pollution. Russia, on the other hand, practices conventional agriculture and uses fertilizers. This suggests that they may not have as strict environmental regulations or waste management practices in place compared to Finland. Step 2: Analyze the Agriculture Practices and Human Waste Management Hypoxia and dead zones are caused by the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals, primarily due to agricultural fertilizers, livestock waste, and human waste.  Finland is more environmentally conscious and may have better agricultural practices, such as using fewer fertilizers, efficient waste management, and sewage treatment facilities. This would result in less human waste and agricultural pollutants entering the ocean. Russia, with its conventional agriculture and fertilizer use, is more likely to contribute to higher levels of marine pollution due to excess nutrients and the lack of strict waste management policies. Step 3: Drawing a Conclusion Based on the information provided and our analysis of environmental practices in both countries, it is likely that Finland causes less human waste to reach the ocean compared to Russia. This conclusion is primarily due to Finland's environmentally conscious approach, better waste management practices, and lower use of agricultural fertilizers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the primary advantages of this platform is its sharing capability, which enables users to collaborate with others by inviting them to view and edit files in shared folders. However, there may be times when users need to leave a shared folder but later decide to rejoin it. This article outlines the steps to rejoin a shared folder in Dropbox, enabling users to regain access to the folder's content. Step 1: Log into Your Dropbox Account Online To begin, users need to access the Dropbox website at https://www.dropbox.com/. Using their preferred internet browser, they can click on the \\"Sign in\\" button located at the top-right corner of the homepage. They must then enter their email address and password associated with their Dropbox account and click the \\"Sign in\\" button again. Step 2: Navigating to the Sharing Page Once logged in, users should see their main Dropbox dashboard that displays their folders and files. To proceed, they must locate the left-hand navigation panel and click on the \\"Sharing\\" tab. This tab contains information about the shared folders a user has been invited to join, along with the ones they have created.  Step 3: Locate the Folder to Rejoin On the Sharing page, users will find two sections: \\"Folders you can edit\\" and \\"Folders you can view.\\" These sections list the shared folders a user is already a part of. However, to rejoin a previously left folder, users need to direct their attention to the \\"Folders you were removed from\\" section. Within this section, users will locate the shared folder they wish to rejoin. If there are several removed folders, they can simply scroll through the list until they find the desired folder.  Step 4: Rejoin the Shared Folder To rejoin a shared folder, users must hover their cursor over the folder in the \\"Folders you were removed from\\" list. A \\"Rejoin\\" button will appear on the right-hand side of that folder. By clicking on this button, they will be automatically added back to the shared folder, granting them access to the files and subfolders within it. Step 5: View the Rejoined Folder After successfully rejoining the shared folder, it will be moved to the \\"Folders you can edit\\" or \\"Folders you can view\\" section, depending on the access permissions granted by the folder owner. To access its contents directly, users can click on the folder within this list. Alternatively, they can return to their Dropbox dashboard and locate the shared folder among their other files and folders. Conclusion Rejoining a shared folder on Dropbox is a simple and straightforward process when the steps provided in this article are followed. By gaining access to a folder's contents, users can once again collaborate with others in real-time, share important documents, or access valuable resources. The ability to rejoin a shared folder is just one of the numerous features that make Dropbox an indispensable tool for both professional and personal use in today’s interconnected world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, the word \\"stylish\\" is key in understanding the intended sentiment. The word \\"stylish\\" can generally be seen as a positive descriptor, as it implies that the film in question possesses a sense of sophistication, fashion, or flair in its presentation. This can refer to various aspects of a movie, such as its cinematography, art direction, costuming, or even the storytelling itself. The phrase \\"this stylish film\\" implies that the speaker regards the movie as visually appealing and well-executed in terms of its creative choices, which indicates a positive sentiment. However, it is important to note that the phrase \\"this stylish film\\" is relatively short and may not provide the entire context of the speaker's opinion. Although the phrase itself leans towards a positive sentiment, additional information from the full review or surrounding sentences may introduce a more critical or even negative perspective on the film, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the sentiment. For example, consider these different scenarios: 1. \\"This stylish film manages to captivate its audience with its exceptional acting and gripping plot.\\" In this case, the sentiment is clearly positive, with the stylishness of the film contributing to its overall appeal and quality. 2. \\"Despite being a stylish film, it ultimately falls flat due to a poorly written script and one-dimensional characters.\\" Here, the sentiment is more mixed or even negative. While the film's style is acknowledged as a positive aspect, it is outweighed by other elements that bring down the overall opinion of the movie. In conclusion, while the phrase \\"this stylish film\\" alone suggests a positive sentiment, it is essential to consider the broader context of the review to fully grasp the speaker's stance on the movie. The more complete the context, the more accurate the interpretation of the sentiment will be."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Once the ride is over, couples might be filled with such joy and happiness from the thrilling sleigh experience. Overwhelmed with positive emotions from the adventure and the beauty of the glittering snow and twinkling lights around them, they would be drawn closer together. In such romantic scenarios, it's quite common for couples to express their affection for each other by having a warm embrace or by sharing a passionate kiss at the end of the ride.  The other options mentioned - decline, going down hill, nausea and death - seem to imply negative outcomes which are not typically associated with a romantic or fun-filled activity such as a sleighing ride. Decline and going down hill signify a reduction or deterioration, nausea implies sickness which is not a normal or desirable outcome of a sleighing ride, and death is certainly too extreme and not in tune with the context of the question.  Therefore, out of all the options given, the act of a couple \\"kissing\\" at the end of the sleighing ride is the most suitable and relevant response. This action symbolizes love, passion and romance, which aligns perfectly with the intimate and joyful nature of a sleighing ride."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She’ll also be the richest person in the world, eclipsing the fortunes of well-known billionaires like Carlos Slim, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg.      Mining tycoon Rinehart is Australia’s richest person, worth 9 billion. Her fortune quadrupled last year thanks to high iron ore prices and rising exports to China. But Australian journalist Tim Treadgold, who recently wrote a Forbes Asia story on Rinehart, believes her net worth could climb as high as 100 billion.      In a story for Australia’s Smart Company, he extrapolates findings from Citigroup Global Markets research on mining projects. The report names Hancock Prospecting, the company Rinehart inherited from her father, as the world’s fifth largest mining outfit. Treadgold’s full story is definitely worth reading, but the thrust of his argument is as follows:      If Rinehart was a company listed on the ASX, and valued using the same 11-times price-to-earnings ratio as her partner, Rio Tinto, she would be worth 30 billion, putting her in the top 10 of the Forbes rich list headed by Mexican telephone magnate, Carlos Slim, at US74 billion, with Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, second at US56 billion. Rinehart, however, has three more mines on the way, and potentially more in the exploration phase. If Rinehart’s three new projects mentioned by Citigroup match the performance of Hope Downs, and if mineral prices stay high (two big assumptions) it is possible to see Rinehart’s portfolio of coal and iron ore production spinning off annual profits approaching 10 billion. If those best guesses prove to be correct, Rinehart is heading for a personal net worth valuation of more than 100 billion, using the Rio Tinto 11-times PE multiple.      Treadgold goes on to say that these numbers are, of course, contingent on “estimates, assumptions, forecasts and predictions.” And yes, 100 billion does sound exceptionally high. Still, he makes a compelling case that Rinehart is one to watch. Even at a 30 billion net worth valuation, based on profit forecasts for her Hope Downs mine, she’d be the world’s richest woman, a title currently held by Walmart heiress Christy Walton. And whereas Walton inherited her wealth, Rinehart is almost entirely self-made. As Treadgold wrote in his Forbes Asia story, Hancock Prospecting was “in shambles” when her father died. She’s spent the last two decades building it up, and it’s paying off.      Follow me on Twitter: @Clare_OC ||||| Gina Rinehart hates the label “Australia’s richest person”. So how will she and the rest of the country react when - not if - she ranks as the “world’s richest\\", as can be forecast using the latest research.      Citigroup Global Markets, a division of the big US banking group Citibank, provided a glimpse into Rinehart’s future in a major report on worldwide resource projects called Generation Next.      The 60-page document looks at 400 mining projects around the world classified as “greenfields”, meaning they are not currently in production, but are moving through the design and approvals process.      As might be expected, the world’s biggest mining companies, including BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Anglo American, are top of the list.      But in fifth spot on the greenfields list, ahead of Brazil’s resources leader Vale, is Hancock Prospecting, the company Rinehart inherited from her father, the late Lang Hancock.      To say this is an amazing ranking is putting it mildly. Putting a single person (because Rinehart owns all of Hancock Prospecting) on a list of global resource giants means that she will, in the future, own projects of a similar size to the biggest miners.      Two factors need to be considered in this, the start of re-rating Rinehart as the world’s richest person. They are:      How did Citigroup apply a common value to different types of mine developments, including coal, gold, iron ore and copper?      Why will Rinehart’s project catapult her up the world’s various rich lists?      The answer to the first question is that all projects were reduced to a common factor, a copper equivalent. In other words, they have been valued as if they were all producing copper, the leading base metal with uses which span a number of industries, from construction to electronics.      The answer to the second question is that Rinehart owns all of hers, whereas the other companies on the list share their wealth with thousands of shareholders.      The strength of Rinehart’s position is shown in the list of the top 10 projects, which is headed by Rio Tinto’s Simandou iron ore mine in the west African country of Guinea. It will start production in 2013, building to an annual output of 70 million tonnes of iron ore, which is calculated by Citigroup to be the equivalent of 875,000 tonnes of copper a year.      Rinehart has three projects in the top 10, the same number as Rio Tinto. BHP Billiton has none.      Roy Hill iron ore in WA, which is scheduled to start production in 2014, building to a rate of 55 million tonnes a year, and valued at 688,888 tonnes of copper equivalent.      Alpha Coal in Queensland, also scheduled to start in 2014 at a rate of 30 million tonnes of coal and year – rated as 563,000 tonnes of copper, and      Kevin’s Corner coal in Queensland, scheduled to start in 2013 also at a rate of 30 million tonnes of coal – and also rated as 563,000 tonnes of copper.      Those three projects are expected to attract joint venture partners in the same way Rinehart brought Rio Tinto in as a partner in her first mine, the Hope Downs iron ore project in WA.      It was the start of production at Hope Downs, plus a perpetual royalty paid by Rio Tinto on most of its WA iron ore production, which pushed Rinehart to the top of the Australia and New Zealand rich list compiled by Forbes magazine, followed later this year by BRW, with both estimating her net worth at between 9-and-10 billion.      Important as the royalty might be, it is Hope Downs which is generating the bulk of Rinehart’s cash flow, as this snapshot illustrates.      At its current annual 30 million tonnes of production, and an iron ore price of around US175 a tonne (A166 a tonne) Hope Downs generates annual revenue of around 5 billion. The cost of producing a tonne of iron ore in the Pilbara is around A40, leaving a profit margin per tonne of around A126, meaning Hope Downs is generating an annual profit of 3.78 billion – with half flowing to Rinehart, or around 1.9 billion.      Hope Downs is expanding to 45 million tonnes a year, which will lift Rinehart’s share to 22.5 million tonnes, taking her annual profit to around 2.8 billion (before the Rio Tinto royalty).      If Rinehart was a company listed on the ASX, and valued using the same 11-times price-to-earnings ratio as her partner, Rio Tinto, she would be worth 30 billion, putting her in the top 10 of the Forbes rich list headed by Mexican telephone magnate, Carlos Slim, at US74 billion, with Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, second at US56 billion.      Rinehart, however, has three more mines on the way, and potentially more in the exploration phase.      If Rinehart’s three new projects mentioned by Citigroup match the performance of Hope Downs, and if mineral prices stay high (two big assumptions) it is possible to see Rinehart’s portfolio of coal and iron ore production spinning off annual profits approaching 10 billion.      If those best guesses prove to be correct, Rinehart is heading for a personal net worth valuation of more than 100 billion, using the Rio Tinto 11-times PE multiple.      It is, at this stage, a game of estimates, assumptions, forecasts and predictions. But the numbers are a guide as to how big Rinehart could become, raising a totally separate set of questions - especially how Australian governments deal with her.      Tim Treadgold is a West Australian journalist.       |||||Summary:","output":"Gina Rinehart is a lady from Australia who has a lot of money because her family owns big land where they dig for iron and other things.

Memo Reveals Tangled Business Ties A 2011 memo made public Wednesday by Wikileaks revealed new details of how former President Bill Clinton made tens of millions of dollars for himself and his wife, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, through an opaque, ethically messy amalgam of philanthropic, business and personal activities. The memo was written by Bill Clinton’s longtime aide, Doug Band, and is among tens of thousands of emails apparently stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chief, John Podesta, in what U.S. officials believe is part of a massive Russian-backed attempt to disrupt the U.S. election. The Band memo came in response to an investigation undertaken by a law firm, Simpson Thatcher, into the activities of the Clinton Foundation at the behest of its board. The board was concerned that some of the activities undertaken by Band and others on behalf of the President could threaten the Foundation’s IRS status as a charity, according to Band’s memo. Chelsea Clinton had also reported concerns to Podesta and other Clinton advisors that Band and his recently-launched consulting firm, Teneo, were using her father’s name without his knowledge to contact British lawmakers for clients, including Dow Chemical. In the 12-page memo, Band describes how he and several colleagues spent much of the years after Bill Clinton’s presidency working to fund the Clinton Foundation, which has raised nearly 2 billion from individuals, corporations and governments for charities focusing on climate change, economic development, health, women and girls issues and other causes. Band claims in the memo that from 2006 to 2011, he and a colleague, Justin Cooper, raised 46 million for the Foundation through the Clinton Global Initiative, an annual networking conference that is one of the Foundation’s big sources of income. But the Foundation work was just a part of what Bill Clinton did during his wife’s time as a Senator and Secretary of State, and it wasn’t always clear where the former president’s non-profit activities ended and his for-profit ones began. Five months before he wrote the memo, Band joined forces with a recently retired State Department envoy, Declan Kelly, to form Teneo, which Band said provided merchant and investment banking services, corporate restructuring, public relations and communications services and strategic advising services to 20 clients, including Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical, UBS, Barclays and BHP Billiton, among others. Over that period, Band says in the memo, Teneo raised 8 million for the Clinton Foundation. And Band was also organizing personal income directly for Clinton. Under the heading, “For-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e. Bill Clinton, Inc.),” Band wrote, “We have dedicated our selves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities—including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements… In support of the President’s for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family—for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities (e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than 50 million in for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the 66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements).” Band mentions four such “arrangements” without naming them. Bill Clinton was paid nearly 18 million to be “honorary chancellor” of a for-profit college, Laureate International Universities, according to reports and the family’s tax returns. A Dubai-based firm, GEMS Education, paid Bill Clinton more than 560,000 in 2015, according to the tax returns. Band also lists a variety of speaking fees, previously disclosed by the Clintons, including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from UBS, Ericsson, BHP and Barclays. In 2011 alone, according to the Clinton’s tax returns, Bill Clinton earned 13,454,000 in speaking fees. No evidence has been found to support allegations of a quid pro quo of official acts by Hillary Clinton as senator or Secretary of State in exchange for the money received by the Clintons or the Clinton Foundation. However the messiness and opacity of the relationship between Clinton’s personal, business and philanthropic undertakings detailed in the memo raises new questions about Bill Clinton’s activity. In the email to which Band’s draft memo was attached, Band tells Podesta he has removed the “lasry section all together.” Marc Lasry is a hedge fund manager and Clinton donor who funded an unsuccessful investment vehicle launched by Chelsea Clinton’s husband Marc Mezvinsky. Other questions arise in the penultimate paragraph of the memo, entitled “Other Matters.” Without providing details, Band writes that since the end of Bill Clinton’s presidency he and Cooper had served as the primary contact and point of management for President Clinton’s activities, including political, business and Foundation matters, speeches, books, and family/personal needs, including “securing in-kind private airplane travel, in-kind vacation stays, and supporting family business and personal needs.” Calls and emails to Band, Teneo and the Clinton Foundation were not immediately returned. The Hillary Clinton campaign declined to confirm that the memo, or other emails released by Wikileaks, are in fact undoctored documents stolen from Podesta’s personal email account. However a campaign spokesperson, Glen Caplin, tweeted on Wednesday that Wikileaks was advancing a “clear political agenda” by “dribbling out” Podesta’s emails. “If Podesta dump was about high-minded transparency @wikileaks would release all at once,” Carlin tweeted. Podesta has said he is cooperating with the FBI in an investigation of the hack. The Clinton Foundation has said it will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton is elected president. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"A Wikileaks memo has shown how former President Bill Clinton made a lot of money for himself and his wife, Hillary Clinton, through a mix of business, charity and personal activities. The memo was written by Bill Clinton's aide, Doug Band, and was part of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton's campaign chief, John Podesta.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If people eat more food from cans, it can be expected that there will be an increase in the number of aluminum cans that need to be recycled. This increased demand for canned food would lead to a higher production and consumption of aluminum cans. As a result, a higher amount of aluminum cans will end up in recycling bins, eventually finding their way to the treatment plants. The perturbation of people consuming more food in cans has both direct and indirect effects on the aluminum recycling process: 1. Direct effect: The increased number of aluminum cans would directly affect the recycling process by requiring treatment plants to handle a larger volume of cans. This could lead to plants needing to expand their facilities, hire more workers, or improve their sorting and cleaning processes to accommodate the higher influx of cans. 2. Indirect effect: With more aluminum cans being recycled, there might be an increased overall demand for recycled aluminum products. This higher demand could lead to a growth in the recycled aluminum industry, potentially creating new jobs and promoting technological advancements in recycling processes. Additionally, the environmental impact of recycling more aluminum could indirectly lead to benefits such as reduced energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions. In conclusion, if people were to eat more food from cans and subsequently recycle more aluminum cans, it would have both direct and indirect effects on the aluminum recycling process.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: About nine million people like rock climbing in America. Millions more take part in the activity around the world. Some do it just for fun. Others compete. Climbing takes strength, control and good balance. Climbers have to pull themselves straight up the face of very high rocks or walls. So they have to be strong enough to carry their own weight. And climbers sometimes have to hold onto rocks by only their fingers or toes. There are several kinds of rock climbing. Traditional rock climbing is done outside. Climbers wear ropes and tie equipment to the rocks as they climb many hundreds of meters up. They also connect their ropes to the equipment. If a climber slips, a rope can stop him from falling. Sport climbing is similar. However, in it the protective equipment is placed in the rock all the time. There is also indoor climbing. Rock walls made of wood have places for the climber's hands and feet. Ice climbing is exactly as it sounds. People climb glaciers or frozen waterfalls instead of rocks. They use special equipment for the ice. And then there is bouldering-climbing rocks   between three and seven meters high. It is quicker and stronger climbing. Many climbers like bouldering because they can use less equipment. Climbers often need only special shoes and chalk  . All climbers use chalk to keep their hands dry. Most rocks have cracks and holes and parts that stick out. Climbers use these for foot-holds and handholds. Climbers use their legs to climb.

Two of the earliest dialectal divisions among Iranian indeed happen to not follow the later division into Western and Eastern blocks. These concern the fate of the Proto-Indo-Iranian first-series palatal consonants, *ć and *dź: Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What elements of Proto-Indo-Iranian did not diverge according to the ensuing split between eastern and western variants?","output":"The question raises an interesting point about the Proto-Indo-Iranian language and its development into the Eastern and Western dialects. But before breaking down specific elements that did not diverge according to the split, it is important to understand the development of the Proto-Indo-Iranian language and its two primary branches. Proto-Indo-Iranian, a sub-branch of the larger Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language family, is the reconstructed common ancestor of two major language groups: Indo-Aryan (also known as Indic) languages and Iranian languages. The division into Eastern (Indo-Aryan) and Western (Iranian) blocks reflects the geographical dispersion and subsequent linguistic divergence of the early Indo-Iranian-speaking peoples. Some key features and elements of Proto-Indo-Iranian that did not significantly diverge with the Eastern and Western split can be discussed as follows: 1. Palatalization: The palatalization of first-series palatal consonants (*ć and *dź) marks one of the early dialectal divisions in the Indo-Iranian languages. This palatalization did not necessarily follow the strict division into Eastern and Western blocks. The loss of these consonants is observed in some eastern languages like Sanskrit, while they were mostly retained in western languages like Avestan. 2. Case system: The Proto-Indo-Iranian language inherited a system of eight grammatical cases (nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, locative, and instrumental) from the Proto-Indo-European language family. This case system remained mostly intact in both eastern and western branches, although some changes occurred in the usage and function of certain cases over time. 3. Gender system: Both Eastern and Western branches retained the Proto-Indo-Iranian gender system, with three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and agreement between nouns and their modifiers, pronouns, and verbs. 4. Verb system: The verb system of Proto-Indo-Iranian was based on a combination of tense, aspect, and voice. Both Eastern and Western branches inherited this system and continued to use it, although the details of conjugation and verbal structure underwent changes in both branches. 5. Shared vocabulary: Despite the division into Eastern and Western blocks, a considerable amount of shared vocabulary was retained in the descendant languages. Many basic words, such as grammatical particles, pronouns, numbers, common verbs, and everyday nouns, originated from the earliest Proto-Indo-Iranian language stage. Overall, while the linguistic differentiation between the Eastern and Western branches of Proto-Indo-Iranian languages did occur, there were several key elements — including palatalization, case and gender systems, the verb system, and shared vocabulary — that did not diverge strictly along the lines of the East-West split. These components serve as reminders that the common ancestry of the Indo-Iranian languages persisted despite the linguistic and geographical diversification that took place over time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower.  Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","output":"Particles would move faster in object A than in object B. This is because object A has a higher temperature, which means it has a higher average kinetic energy. As a result, its particles have more energy and move more quickly.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator.  - Notopteroidei is a suborder of the order Osteoglossiformes that contains the Gymnarchidae (aba), Notopteridae (feather backs and knifefish), mormyrids (the elephantfishes), as well as extinct families.  - Oncorhynchus is a genus of fish in the family Salmonidae; it contains the Pacific salmon and Pacific trout. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek \\"onkos\\" (\\"hook\\") and \\"rynchos\\" (\\"nose\\"), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the \\"kype\\").  - Osteoglossiformes (Greek: \\"bony tongues\\") is a relatively primitive order of ray-finned fish that contains two sub-orders, the Osteoglossoidei and the Notopteroidei. All of at least 245 living species inhabit freshwater. They are found in South America, Africa, Australia and southern Asia, having first evolved in Gondwana before that continent broke up.  - Salmo is a genus of fish in the salmon family Salmonidae that includes the European species of salmon and trout, among them the familiar Atlantic salmon \\"Salmo salar\\" and the brown trout \\"Salmo trutta\\". The natural distribution of \\"Salmo\\" also extends to Northern Africa and to Western Asia around the Black Sea basin. The single \\"Salmo\\" species naturally found in the Atlantic North America is the Atlantic salmon, whereas the salmon and trout of the Pacific basin belong to another genus, \\"Oncorhynchus\\". The generic name \\"Salmo\\" derives from the Latin \\"salm\\" (salmon). The number of distinct species and subspecies in \\"Salmo\\" is a debated issue. Atlantic salmon and brown trout are widespread species, while most of the other taxa are narrowly distributed forms endemic to single watersheds.  - Trout is the common name for a number of species of freshwater fish belonging to the genera \\"Oncorhynchus\\", \\"Salmo\\" and \\"Salvelinus\\", all of the subfamily Salmoninae of the family Salmonidae. The word \\"trout\\" is also used as part of the name of some non-salmonid fish such as \\"Cynoscion nebulosus\\", the spotted seatrout or speckled trout.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Salmonidae is a family of ray-finned fish, the only living family currently placed in the order Salmoniformes. It includes salmon, trout, chars, freshwater whitefishes, and graylings, which collectively are known as the salmonids. The Atlantic salmon and trout of the genus \\"Salmo\\" give the family and order their names.  - Tertiary is the former term for the geologic period from 66 million to 2.58 million years ago, a time span that lies between the superseded Secondary period and the Quaternary. The Tertiary is no longer recognized as a formal unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, but the word is still widely used. The traditional span of the Tertiary has been divided between the Paleogene and Neogene Periods and extends to the first stage of the Pleistocene Epoch, the Gelasian age.  The period began with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs in the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event, at the start of the Cenozoic Era, and extended to the beginning of the Quaternary glaciation at the end of the Pliocene Epoch.  - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.  - The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.  - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\"donor\\" organism(s).  - Osteoglossoidei are a suborder of the order Osteoglossiformes (Latin: \\"bony tongues\\") that contains the butterflyfish, the arowanas and bonytongues, as well as extinct families.  - In paleogeography, Gondwana, also Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510 million years ago (Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it.  - The arapaima, pirarucu, or paiche are any large species of bonytongue in the genus Arapaima native to the Amazon and Essequibo basins of South America. Genus \\"Arapaima\\" is the type genus of the family Arapaimidae. They are among the world's largest freshwater fish, reaching as much as . They are an important food fish. They have declined in the native range due to overfishing and habitat loss. In contrast, arapaima have been introduced to several tropical regions outside the native range (within South America and elsewhere) where they are sometimes considered invasive species. Its local name, \\"pirarucu\\", derives from the indigenous words for \\"pira\\" meaning \\"fish\\" and \\"urucum\\" meaning \\"red\\".  - The Paleocene or Palaeocene, the \\"old recent\\", is a geologic epoch that lasted from about . It is the first epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era. As with many geologic periods, the strata that define the epoch's beginning and end are well identified, but the exact ages remain uncertain.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.  - Salvelinus is a genus of salmonid fish often called char or charr; some species are called \\"trout\\". \\"Salvelinus\\" is a member of the Salmoninae subfamily of the Salmonidae family. The genus has a northern circumpolar distribution, and most of its members are typically cold-water fish that primarily inhabit fresh waters. Many species also migrate to the sea, however.  - The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of most vertebrates that manipulates food for mastication, and is used in the act of swallowing. It is of importance in the digestive system and is the primary organ of taste in the gustatory system. The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered in taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals.  - Omnivore is a consumption classification for animals that have the capability to obtain chemical energy and nutrients from materials originating from plant and animal origin. Often, omnivores also have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet as well.  - Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.  - Opsithrissops ( Ancient Greek : \`\` Aspect Fish Face '' ) is an extinct genus of prehistoric bony fish that lived during the Thanetian stage of the Paleocene epoch . It is a small 100 centimetres ( 3.3 ft ) nektonic opportunistic carnivore in the family Osteoglossiformes which includes other bony - tongues such as the extant species of Arowana and Arapaima . It hunted small invertebrates and fish similarly to today 's trout and became a Paleogene keystone species in many habitats before its disappearance from the fossil record .  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Arowanas are freshwater bony fish of the family Osteoglossidae, also known as bonytongues (the latter name is now often reserved for Arapaimidae). In this family of fish, the head is bony and the elongated body is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name \\"bonytongues\\" is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the \\"tongue\\", equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The arowana is a facultative air breather and can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into its swim bladder, which is lined with capillaries like lung tissue.  - The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phanerós) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - Salmon is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus \\"Salmo\\") and Pacific Ocean (genus \\"Oncorhynchus\\"). Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'opsithrissops' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon'. Find the answer from the choices below.

Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! (Ring out, you songs; sound, you strings!), BWV 172, in Weimar for Pentecost Sunday in 1714. Bach led the first performance on 20 May 1714 in the Schlosskirche, the court chapel in the ducal Schloss. Erschallet, ihr Lieder is an early work in a genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. Bach was appointed Konzertmeister in Weimar in the spring of 1714, a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month. He composed Erschallet, ihr Lieder as the third cantata in the series, to a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck. The text reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit. The librettist included a quotation from the day's prescribed Gospel reading in the only recitative, and for the closing chorale he used a stanza from Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern\\" (1599). The work is in six movements, and scored for four vocal soloists, four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, oboe, bassoon and a string orchestra of two violins, two violas, and basso continuo. The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar. The cantata opens with a chorus, followed by the recitative, in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ). A bass aria with trumpets addresses the Trinity, and a tenor aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the Creation. This is followed by an intimate duet of the Soul (soprano) and the Spirit (alto), to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of Martin Luther's hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\" and a solo cello provides the bass line. The theme of intimacy between God and Man is developed further in the following chorale, after which Bach specified an unusual repeat of the opening chorus.

(June 27) AP      Marchers carry signs in downtown Pittsburgh as they protest the shooting death of Antwon Rose Jr. (Photo: Keith Srakocic, AP)      A Pennsylvania police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed black teen hours after being sworn into the East Pittsburgh Police Department was charged Wednesday with one count of criminal homicide.      Authorities say Officer Michael Rosfeld, who is white, shot Antwon Rose Jr., 17, on June 19 while fleeing from a car that had been stopped on suspicion it was involved in a drive-by shooting. Police were questioning the driver when Rose and another man fled. Rose was shot three times.      \\"This is a small stride toward justice, but we have a very long road ahead,\\" said lawyer S. Lee Merritt, who said he plans to file a federal lawsuit on behalf of the Rose family.      No weapons were found on Rose, but two guns were found in the vehicle, police said. The other man who fled the scene, Zaijuan Hester, was charged this week with attempted homicide and other counts related to the drive-by shooting. The driver was not charged.      The criminal complaint says Rosfeld first told investigators Rose moved his hand toward Rosfeld and appeared to be holding something \\"he perceived as a gun.” Later, Rosfeld told investigators he did not see a gun and he was not sure if the teen’s arm was pointed at him when the fatal shots were fired.

East Pittsburgh police officer Michael Rosfeld was charged with homicide Wednesday in connection with last week's shooting death of Antwon Rose, and court documents say the officer made inconsistent statements to detectives about why he pulled the trigger.      \\"You do not shoot someone in the back if they are not a threat to you,\\" Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr., said in a news conference.      Rosfeld was arraigned just before 8 a.m. by District Judge Regis Charles Welsh, according to court records. He was released on 250,000 unsecured bond. Reached late Wednesday, Rosfeld's attorney, Patrick Tomassey, confirmed that Allegheny County Judge Jeffrey Manning modified Rosfeld's bond to include electronic monitoring.

Fred Rabner, an attorney for Rose's family, said the family viewed the filing of charges with \\"guarded optimism.\\"      \\"There is still a long road ahead to a conviction and proper sentencing, which is the only thing we will accept as justice,\\" Rabner said. \\"In this area of civil rights we know that from protests to policy is a marathon not a sprint and we hope that this case has the endurance to change the landscape of the country on this important issue of police brutality.\\"      The shooting happened at about 8:40 p.m. June 19 after East Pittsburgh police pulled over a car near Grandview Avenue and Howard Street. The car matched the description of one involved in an earlier shooting in North Braddock.      As police ordered the 20-year-old driver to the ground, Rose and another passenger, who has since been identified as 17-year-old Zaijuan Hester, ran from the car. Rosfeld opened fire, hitting Rose, also 17, three times.      In an eight-page criminal complaint, Allegheny County detectives detailed their interviews with at least six witnesses to the East Pittsburgh and North Braddock shootings, including two who said that Rose and Hester clearly had nothing in their hands when they ran from the car after police pulled it over in East Pittsburgh.      A person identified in the complaint as Witness 2 lives several houses away from the East Pittsburgh shooting scene and told police they were on their front porch as the incident unfolded.      That witness watched as Rosfeld ordered the driver out of the car and to the ground. After the driver complied, Rosfeld ordered the car's other two occupants out of the vehicle and they ran toward Route 30, the complaint said.      Witness 2 could \\"clearly see that neither male had anything in his hands,\\" detectives wrote in the complaint.      A person identified in the complaint as Witness 3 also lives nearby and reported seeing the person in the front passenger seat get out of the car and begin to put his hands on the roof of the car but then turned and ran away.      \\"Witness 3 said the officer then fired his weapon three times at the person as he ran away,\\" detectives wrote. \\"Witness 3 stated the person's hands were empty and the officer shot at him as he was running away from the officer.\\"      Rosfeld provided a conflicting account to detectives, according to the complaint.      Rosfeld initially told detectives that when he ordered the driver out of the car and onto the ground, the front-seat passenger got out of the vehicle.      \\"(Rosfeld) said this person turned his hand toward (Rosfeld) and he, (Rosfeld), saw something dark that he perceived as a gun,\\" detectives wrote. \\"This observation caused him to step from behind the cover of his car door to acquire a better view. He then fired his weapon.\\"      Detectives later asked Rosfeld to go over the sequence of events a second time.      \\"During that rendition, Rosfeld told the detectives that he did not see a gun when the passenger emerged and ran,\\" they wrote.      \\"When confronted with this inconsistency, Rosfeld stated he saw something in the passenger's hand but was not sure what it was,\\" detectives wrote, adding he \\"was not certain if the individual who had his arm pointed at him was still pointing at him when he fired the shots.\\"      The complaint said Rose was struck in the right side of his face, in his right elbow and in the middle of his back. The wound to the back was fatal, according to the complaint.      Statements from witnesses to the earlier North Braddock shooting seem to place Rose in the front passenger seat and Hester in the back passenger seat.      A 22-year-old man identified in the complaint as Witness 1 was standing near another man on North Braddock's Jones Avenue when he heard gunfire and realized he'd been struck, the complaint said. He would be treated and released from a hospital for a grazing wound to the abdomen.      Surveillance footage gathered by detectives showed the rear passenger window of the car in which Rose and Hester were riding come down and a passenger holding a gun began shooting, according to the complaint. Detectives noted that the front passenger window remained closed.      The man standing near Witness 1 returned fire.      The same backseat passenger then fired at another man on the street, who returned fire, detectives wrote. The driver of the car in which Rose and Hester were riding said shots fired from inside his car came from the rear passenger seat.      The driver told police he knew Rose and Hester, and they hired him that night to drive them from Rankin's Hawkins Village to Grandview Avenue in East Pittsburgh, according to the complaint.      Police found two guns in the jitney driver's car: a 9mm Glock model 26 pistol under the front portion of the front passenger seat that was loaded with a 17-round magazine that contained 16 rounds; and a .40-caliber Glock 22 pistol under the rear portion of the front passenger seat with a live round in the chamber and an extended magazine with 18 rounds.      Shell casings found on the ground in North Braddock matched the latter gun, police wrote.      An empty handgun magazine found in Rose's pocket fit the 9mm pistol found under the front portion of the front passenger seat, according to the complaint.

He is accused of shooting a 17-year-old boy named Antwon Rose Jr. Officer Rosfeld had become a member of the East Pittsburgh Police Department just hours before the shooting happened.  The police stopped a car because they thought it might have something to do with another crime. Antwon and another man decided to run away from the car when the police started asking questions. Even though Antwon was not carrying a weapon, Officer Rosfeld shot him three times. Officer Rosfeld first told the police that he thought Antwon had a gun, but later he said he wasn't sure if Antwon had a gun or not. Antwon's death has made many people very upset and they have been protesting in the city. The other man who ran from the car, Zaijuan Hester, had a charge made against him for trying to kill someone. This charge has to do with the crime that police were investigating at the time of the traffic stop. Officer Rosfeld isn't working as a police officer right now and he will go to court on July 6. There's a lot of confusion and disagreement about exactly what happened and why, so the court case will be used to try and find out the truth."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Summarize this article: An FBI mole who provided valuable intelligence on al Qaeda and met with Osama bin Laden was lured away from the FBI to work for the CIA, but was killed by al Qaeda operatives in Bosnia who suspected he was an informant, NBC News has learned exclusively.      The informant, a Sudan-born driver and confidante to “Blind Sheikh” Omar Abdel-Rahman, the radical Muslim cleric who allegedly masterminded the first attempt to take down the World Trade Center, had been the sole human asset providing first-person information about al Qaeda in the mid-1990s as the terror group gained strength around the globe.      According to sources familiar with the management of the mole, the FBI recruited him in 1993 because he was a known associate of the Blind Sheikh.      Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the alleged mastermind of the first World Trade Center bombing. Ted Thai / Time Life Pictures via Getty Images      The Egyptian-born Sheikh had been an FBI target since at least Nov. 5, 1990, when one of his followers, El Sayyid Nosair, shot and killed radical Rabbi Meir Kahane in a Manhattan hotel. After the shooting, boxes of information were found in Nosair’s apartment that hinted at a larger conspiracy.      Under pressure, the Sheikh moved some of his operations from the New York area to Los Angeles, where the future mole was living. The mole became the Sheikh’s driver. That’s when the FBI first noticed him, and started the process that would turn him into an informant.      In early 1993, the Immigration and Naturalization Service tipped the FBI to the driver’s identity, and the FBI found that he was on a terrorism watch list. The INS then tried to deport the driver, only to discover that the driver’s status as a possible Islamic militant made it hard to find a country that would accept him.      Jordan agreed to take him, but then threw him in jail for three months. The driver wound up in Yemen, where the FBI began to reel him in.      Though the chronology is unclear, by around this time terrorists had mounted their first attack on New York’s World Trade Center. On Feb. 26, 1993, a truck filled with 1,500 pounds of explosive detonated in an underground garage, killing six people but failing to take down the twin towers.      The FBI increased its focus on the Sheikh and his associates, who were suspected of involvement. In Yemen, the FBI agent who would later become the driver’s handler – Bassem Youssef, the bureau’s highest ranking Arabic speaker – made his first approach. According to sources, he introduced himself to the driver not as an agent, but as a friend who could help reunite the driver with his family in California, via personal connections with an important L.A. judge.      The bureau also obtained warrants to listen to phone calls to and from the driver’s home, including conversations with the Sheikh. And it began to work on the driver’s wife, who became a cooperating source.      The driver, however, still didn’t know he was talking to the FBI. But after subsequent meetings with Youssef and other agents in Rome and Brussels, he learned the truth, and agreed to provide information, said sources. He started talking about a terror group called al Qaeda. In Brussels, he passed a polygraph test, and then produced a dozen authentic U.S. and Canadian passports in which the original pictures had been replaced with the pictures of al Qaeda operatives. The operatives had used the passports to crisscross Europe and spread the message of jihad.      The driver was also able to arrange a trip to his home country of Sudan for a meeting with one of the Sheikh’s associates, a little-known Saudi-born terror leader named Osama bin Laden.      “Bin Laden was not bin Laden then,” said one Justice Department official. “He was not that hard to get to.”      In Sudan, bin Laden told the mole that he had “picked out” a Masonic Lodge in Los Angeles for an “explosion.” The mole also told the FBI that the Sheikh said, “If you need any money, you go to Osama directly and tell him I sent you.” It is not known whether the source tried to solicit funds from bin Laden.      Back in the U.S., the Blind Sheikh was arrested along with nine followers on June 24, 1993. He was later convicted of conspiracy for planned attacks on American landmarks, and sentenced to life in prison.      The informant continued working for the FBI after the Sheikh’s arrest, said sources. But the mole’s success had piqued the interest of another U.S. agency, the CIA. In 1994, a civilian female working for the CIA was able to convince the informant, with the help of a large sum of money, to work for the CIA instead of the FBI.      In 1994 or 1995, the CIA dispatched the informant to Bosnia, where jihadis were aiding Bosnia’s Muslim majority in a war against Serbian forces.      The FBI did not know at the time that its informant had started working for the CIA, or why he had disappeared. His former handler, Bassem Youssef, who by then was working undercover in Los Angeles as a supposed member of al Qaeda, began asking his al Qaeda sources what had become of the driver.      They told Youssef that the driver had gone to Bosnia, and that al Qaeda operatives there had killed him because they believed that he was a mole for the CIA. Later, Youssef was able to confirm that the al Qaeda operatives’ suspicions were justified, and that the driver had been working for the CIA.      The existence of the informant was first revealed during courtroom testimony in 2010, as part of a discrimination suit filed by Bassem Youssef against the FBI. Youssef accused the bureau of passing him over for promotion despite his skills.      Testifying on Youssef’s behalf, former assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s L.A. office Ed Curran revealed that Youssef had developed the Blind Sheikh’s driver as an informant.      “It was the only source I know in the bureau where we had a source right in al Qaeda, directly involved,” Curran told the court, according to excerpts of testimony published by the Washington Times. He also testified that the informant was “tight, close” with al Qaeda leadership.      The Washington Times was the first media outlet to report on Curran’s revelation, and noted that the bureau had declined to tell the 9/11 Commission, which investigated al Qaeda’s 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, about the al Qaeda informant’s existence.      Sources told NBC News, however, that they weren’t sure the informant was relevant to the 9/11 Commission, because by 2001 his short, albeit productive, relationship with the U.S. government – and his life – had been over for six years.      In a statement, the FBI said that the FBI “made all relevant information available to the 9/11 Commission.”      The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      Bassem Youssef is still with the FBI and continues to pursue his discrimination suit. ||||| Guy Taylor is the National Security Team Leader at The Washington Times, overseeing the paper’s State Department, Pentagon and intelligence community coverage.

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Sure, let me explain that in simpler terms for you.  A long time ago, there were some bad men who didn't like the United States. They wanted to do something really harmful. One of those bad men was named Mohamed Atta. He was from Egypt, but he went to Germany to study. In Germany, Atta made friends with three other men who also didn't like the United States. Atta and his friends were good at speaking English and knew a lot about life in Europe. This made them perfect for the bad men's harmful plan. They all went to a faraway place called Afghanistan to join the other bad men and get ready for their plan. This group became very important in the big harmful thing that happened on September 11, 2001, in the United States.

I was really dissapointed in the last tour to the point where I actually had to walk out, the sound was bad the energy was bad it just wasn't the same band I have seen so many times and looked forward to seeing. when this live album came out I got it because I have everything they have recorded, I was skeptical because of my expierence at the concert but thought that maybe it was just a bad night. The album prooves it wasn't a bad night but a bad tour. I highly reccomend any TKK album, but avoid this one at all costs.. hopefully Groovy Mann and Levi can get the wheels back on the band and get back to awsome music. Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is indeed negative. The reviewer expresses their deep disappointment in both the latest tour and the live album, stating that the sound and energy were lacking. They mention being a long-time fan and had enjoyed the band's previous performances, but their experience with the last tour led them to walk out of the concert. The live album, according to the reviewer, confirms that it was not just a bad night but an overall poor quality tour. There is a clear hint of pessimism in the reviewer's tone when they express skepticism before purchasing the live album, and their experience confirms their doubts. They strongly recommend other albums by the artist but emphasize to \\"avoid this one at all costs.\\" The mention of hoping that Groovy Mann and Levi can get the band back on track implies their disappointment with the present direction and quality of the band's music.

Hypothesis: The plan is to deploy 1,700 peacekeeping troops.","output":"After reading the given paragraph, it appears that the hypothesis stating \\"The plan is to deploy 1,700 peacekeeping troops\\" is false. According to Francis Deng's belief expressed in the text, the government will be receptive to the plan that consists of deploying 1,800, not 1,700, peacekeeping troops. This information is critical in understanding the accurate troop count linked to the deployment plan and serves as vital evidence in discrediting the hypothesis. It is equally important to consider the implications of a 100-troop difference. The distinction between 1,700 and 1,800 troops could lead to changes in allocated resources, logistics, and overall plan execution. Acknowledging this disparity is essential, as it will impact the decision-making process if it were to be overlooked. Furthermore, the paragraph reflects Francis Deng's beliefs, but further context is required to better understand the situation. For instance, it would be beneficial to know the context surrounding the peacekeeping mission and the reasons behind the government's potential receptiveness, as well as Francis Deng's credibility and experience in engaging with the government or contributing to the plan.

Process: - Magma moves closer to the Earth&#x27;s crust - The magma starts to cool - The cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense - The condensed magma solidifies - The solidified magma forms minerals.  Question: suppose environment improving makes butterflies more healthy happens, how will it affect the magma condenses less.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"C: No effect The health of butterflies and the process of magma condensation are two unrelated occurrences, and an improvement in the environment that leads to healthier butterflies will not have an effect on the cooling and condensation of magma. Let's break down each part of the relationships at play here to make it clear. 1. Magma condensation: The process of magma condensation or solidification occurs deep below the Earth's crust and is influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the composition of the magma itself. Some other factors that might impact the rate of magma cooling include the rate of heat loss to the surrounding rock, whether water is present in the magma, and the extent of partial crystallization. As the magma cools down, the atoms slow down and begin to arrange themselves into a more ordered, crystalline structure. This leads to the formation of solid minerals that can form rocks like basalt, granite, or gabbro, depending on the chemical composition of the magma. 2. Environment and butterfly health: Butterflies, on the other hand, are influenced by various environmental factors, many of which can affect their overall health and wellbeing. An improvement in the environment could include a reduction in pollution levels and pesticide use, increased availability of nectar sources, and an increase in suitable host plants for their larvae. These factors are crucial to butterflies in terms of reproduction and survival. When the environment is improved, butterflies may see better health due to increased food sources, less exposure to harmful chemicals, and a reduction in habitat destruction. In turn, this could lead to increased populations and greater biodiversity. However, the processes leading to healthier butterflies have no direct impact on the geological processes that occur deep within the Earth, such as magma condensation. The two phenomena are unrelated, and any changes to butterfly health will not influence the rate of magma cooling and solidification.

It was founded in 1965 as part of a government initiative to expand access to higher education. Warwick Business School was established in 1967 and Warwick Medical School was opened in 2000. Warwick merged with Coventry College of Education in 1979 and Horticulture Research International in 2004. Warwick is primarily based on a 290 hectare campus on the outskirts of Coventry with a satellite campus in Wellesbourne and a London base at the Shard in central London. It is organised into four facultiesArts, Medicine, Science and Social Scienceswithin which there are 32 departments. Warwick has around 23,600 full-time students and 1,800 academic and research staff and had a total income of £573.6 million in 2015/16, of which £117.1 million was from research grants and contracts. Warwick Arts Centre, a multi-venue arts complex in the university's main campus, is the largest venue of its kind in the UK outside London. Warwick consistently ranks in the top ten of all major domestic rankings of British universities and is the only multi-faculty institution aside from Oxford and Cambridge to have never been ranked outside the top ten. It was ranked 7th in the UK amongst multi-faculty institutions for the quality (GPA) of its research and 15th for its Research Power in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework. Entrance is competitive, with around 7 applicants per place for undergraduate study. Warwick has been ranked as the world's 20th best university based on employer reputation. Warwick is a member of AACSB, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Association of MBAs, EQUIS, the European University Association, the M5 Group, the Russell Group and Universities UK. It is the only European member of the Center for Urban Science and Progress, a collaboration with New York University. The university has extensive commercial activities, including the University of Warwick Science Park and Warwick Manufacturing Group. History. Twentieth...  - The Shard, also referred to as the Shard of Glass, Shard London Bridge and formerly London Bridge Tower, is a 95-storey skyscraper in Southwark, London, that forms part of the London Bridge Quarter development. Standing high, the Shard is the tallest building in the United Kingdom, the fourth-tallest building in Europe and the 105th-tallest building in the world. It is also the second-tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, after the concrete tower at the Emley Moor transmitting station.  - The Research Excellence Framework is the successor to the Research Assessment Exercise. It is an Impact evaluation; assessing the research of British higher education institutions. It was used in 2014 to assess UK research during the period 20082013.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Warwick Business School (WBS) is an academic department of the University of Warwick, originally established in 1967 as the School of Industrial and Business Studies. It is one of the most prestigious and highly selective business schools in the world. Due to the school's historical international outlook its alumni hold leadership positions in corporate, governmental and academic institutions around the globe.  - The European University Association (EUA) represents and supports more than 850 institutions of higher education in 47 countries, providing them with a forum for cooperation and exchange of information on higher education and research policies. Members of the Association are European universities involved in teaching and research, national associations of rectors and other organisations active in higher education and research.  - A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011.  - Sir Kenneth Robinson ( born 4 March 1950 ) is an English author , speaker and international advisor on education in the arts to government , non-profits , education and arts bodies .

The group is headquartered in London and was established in 1994 to represent its members' interests, principally to government and parliament; nineteen smaller British research universities formed the 1994 Group in response, which has since dissolved. In 2010, Russell Group members received approximately two-thirds of all university research grant and contract income in the United Kingdom. The group is widely perceived as representing the best universities in the country.  - The University of Warwick Science Park (also known as UWSP and Warwick Science Park) was one of the first university based science parks in the United Kingdom when it was opened by the Rt. Hon. Margaret Thatcher in 1984. It was a joint venture between the University of Warwick, Coventry City Council, Warwickshire County Council and Barclays. The latter are no longer shareholders having been replaced by WM Enterprise. The University of Warwick agreed in 2011 to purchase the shareholding of Coventry City Council. The acquisition was completed in 2012 and today the Science Park is wholly owned by the University of Warwick. UWSP currently covers four sites; the main campus abutting the University of Warwick, the Business Innovation Centre in Binley, Warwick Innovation Centre on Warwick Technology Park and Blythe Valley Innovation Centre near Solihull.  - Universities UK is an advocacy organisation for universities in the United Kingdom.

Article: The evidence for harmony may not be obvious in some families. But it seems that four out of five young people now get on well with their parents, which is the opposite of the popularly-held image of unhappy teenagers locked in their room after endless family quarrels. An important new study into teenage attitudes surprisingly shows that their family life is more harmonious than it had ever been in the past. \\"We were surprised by just how positive today's young people seem to be about their families,\\" said one number of the research team. \\"They're expected to be rebellious and selfish but actually they have other things on their minds: they want a car and material goods, and they worry about whether school is serving them well. There's more negotiation and discussion between parents and children, and children expect to take part in the family decision-making process. They don't want to rock the boat.\\" So it seems that this generation of parents is much more likely than parents of 30 years ago to treat their children as friends. \\"My parents are happy to discuss things with me and willing to listen to me,\\" says 17-year-old Daniel Lazall. \\"I always tell them when I'm going out clubbing. As long as they know what I'm doing, they're fine with me.\\" Susan Crome, who is now 21, agrees. \\"Looking back on the last 10 years, there was a lot of what you could call negotiation. For example, as long as I'd done all my homework, I could go out on a Saturday night. But I think my grandparents were a lot stricter with my parents than that.\\" Maybe this positive view of family life should not be unexpected. It is possible that the idea of teenage rebellion is not rooted in real facts. A researcher comments, \\"Our surprise that teenagers say they get along well with their parents comes because of a brief period in our social history when teenagers were regarded as different beings.

Given the question: Given the following context:  Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who was attending school in Knutsford by 1818?

Input: The Illinois Department of Labor reproach focused on emails that Illinois Veterans Home administrators sent to state workers, WBEZ Chicago reported Thursday. State labor officials said the Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs “failed to effectively notify all employees” about the outbreak. Labor officials also said the veterans’ agency didn’t instruct workers about “proper precautions to avoid or eliminate exposure in a timely manner.” The disease has caused the deaths of 13 residents since 2015 and made dozens more residents and staff members seriously ill. State labor officials became involved after two sickened staffers complained to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. AFSCME, the public union representing some Quincy workers, argued the veterans’ home didn’t do enough to warn employees about the disease threat. Illinois Veterans’ Affairs Director Erica Jeffries, who resigns next week, said Quincy employees were kept informed about the outbreak through emails, meetings and informational material posted at nursing stations. “We communicated effectively to our staff and to our residents and certainly to the family members of each resident that was exhibiting signs and symptoms of pneumonia,” she said in a statement. Her spokesman, Dave MacDonna, said the veterans’ affairs department “has been transparent concerning its response to the outbreak in 2015 and has provided thousands of documents to both members of the media and the General Assembly.” State Department of Labor spokesman Ben Noble said former state Labor Director Hugo Chaviano approved issuing the written reprimand but said there was no citation because no workplace safety standards were violated. Noble said the department hasn’t received any follow-up complaints. Rauner’s administration last week recommended starting fresh at the western Illinois home with a state-of-the-art facility on the 130-year-old campus costing between 190 million and 230 million. ___ Information from: WBEZ-FM.

The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event.  - Geir Andersen ( born February 12 , 1964 ) is a Norwegian nordic combined skier who competed from 1983 to 1989 . He won three medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships with one gold ( 1984 : 3 x 10 km team ) and two silvers ( 1985 : 15 km individual , 3 x 10 km team ) . Andersen also finished 10th in the individual event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo . He had six individual victories in his career from 1984 to 1985 .  - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing.  - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen.  - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate.  - The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. Championship events include nordic skiing's three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympics. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years.  - Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing.  - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline.

Bake until done, then cover the top of each cupcake with frosting....I think the answer is","output":"The more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of making cupcakes is: Option: * Put paper cupcake liners into each cell of a muffin tin and then fill each liner with cupcake batter. Bake until done, then cover the top of each cupcake with frosting. This method is more reasonable for a number of reasons: 1. Proper preparation: Placing paper cupcake liners into each cell of a muffin tin is the standard way of preparing the tin for baking cupcakes. This is because it helps the cupcakes hold their shape, allows for easy removal from the tin, and makes them easy to handle and decorate once baked. 2. Sequence of steps: Putting the cupcake batter into the liners first, followed by baking, and then applying the frosting, is the correct sequence of steps when making cupcakes. The batter needs to be baked first to create the structure and foundation of the cupcakes. Baking also ensures the cupcakes rise properly, develop a tender crumb, and achieve the right level of doneness. 3. Frosting application: As cupcakes need to cool down completely before frosting them, it would be impractical to put frosting into the liners before baking. Frosting would melt and mix with the batter, resulting in an unsuccessful final product. The ideal time to apply frosting is after the cupcakes have cooled down. This allows the frosting to stay intact and maintain its consistency, flavor, and visual appeal. 4. Consistency and texture: Frosting plays a vital role in giving cupcakes their characteristic moistness, richness, and sweetness. By placing frosting on top of a baked cupcake, you ensure the desired consistency and texture is retained. If frosting were to be mixed with the batter and baked together, it would lose its intended properties and cause the cupcakes to have an undesirable texture. 5. Final presentation: Cupcakes are known for their visually appealing and appetizing frosted tops. By using the more reasonable method, you can decorate cupcakes with a swirl of frosting, any desired toppings, and other decorative elements, offering an aesthetically pleasing final product. In conclusion, putting cupcake liners into each cell of a muffin tin, filling the liners with cupcake batter, baking until done, and then covering the top of each cupcake with frosting is the most reasonable method for making and decorating cupcakes to achieve the best taste and appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
