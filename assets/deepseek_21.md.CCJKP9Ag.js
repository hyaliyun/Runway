Thus, it offers very little information to the reader. 2. Depth: The review lacks depth as it does not mention anything about the subject being reviewed. There are no details or specific comments that could help the reader understand the reviewer's perspective. 3. Clarity: Although the word \\"Fireman\\" is clear, the lack of context or explanation makes it difficult for the reader to understand the intent of the review or how it relates to the subject.  4.

Article: The term \\"multitasking\\" originally referred to a computer's ability to carry out several tasks at one time. For many people, multitasking has become a way of life and even a key to success. In fact, some excellent mental aerobic exercises involve engaging the brain in two or more challenging activities at a time. Although checking e-mail while talking on a phone and reading the newspaper may be second nature for some people, many times multitasking can make us less productive, rather than more. And studies show that too much multitasking can lead to increased stress, anxiety and memory loss. In order to multitask, the brain uses an area known as the prefrontal cortex  . Brain scans of volunteers performing multiple tasks together show that as they shift from task to task, this front part of the brain actually takes a moment of rest between tasks. You may have experienced a prefrontal cortex \\"moment of rest\\" yourself if you've ever dialed a phone number and suddenly forgotten who you dialed when the line is answered. What probably occurred is that between the dialing and the answering, your mind shifted to anther thought or task, and then took that \\"moment\\" to come back. Research has also shown that for many volunteers, job efficiency declines while multitasking, as compared to when they perform only one task at a time. Multitasking is easiest when at least one of the tasks is habitual, or requires little thought. Most people don't find it difficult to eat and read the newspaper at the same time. However, when two or more attention-requiring tasks are attempted at one time, people sometimes make mistakes. We often don't remember things as well when we're trying to manage several details at the same time. Without mental focus, we may not pay enough attention to new information coming in, so it never makes it into our memory stores. That is one of the main reasons we forget people's names--even sometimes right after they have introduced themselves. Multitasking can also affect our relationships. If someone...

We got what we had expected and more. The answer is:","output":"The given review would most likely increase the chances of you buying the product. There are several reasons for this positive impact on your decision-making process, which can be analyzed further. 1. Review title: The title of the review, \\"Excellent Product,\\" clearly states that the reviewer had a positive experience with the product. This creates an initial positive impression, as potential buyers tend to rely on the experiences of others to determine if a product is worth their investment. 2. Age-appropriateness: The reviewer mentions that their six-year-old son received the product as a Christmas gift and loves it. This statement suggests that the product is suitable for children around the same age, making it a good choice if you’re considering purchasing it for a young child. 3. Durability: The reviewer also found the product to be durable. This is an essential factor for many people, as the lifespan of a product can greatly impact its overall value. By stating that the product seems durable, the reviewer implies that it is likely to be a worthwhile investment and able to withstand wear and tear, especially when considering that it's being used by a young child who may not handle items with the same care as an adult. 4. Meeting and exceeding expectations: The reviewer notes that the product not only met their expectations but also exceeded them. This statement further reinforces the idea that you would be making a good purchase, as the product has delivered more than what was initially anticipated by the reviewer. 5. Overall positive impression: The entire review conveys a positive experience with the product, which can heavily influence your decision-making process. Positive reviews often make potential buyers feel more confident in their choice, leading them to choose that particular product over others. In conclusion, the contents of this review would likely increase the chances of you buying the product. The positive experiences of the reviewer, who emphasizes factors like the product's age-appropriateness, durability, and ability to meet and exceed expectations, contribute to creating a favorable impression of the product, making it more appealing for prospective buyers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was associated with the utopian and Symbolists artistic and literary community Abbaye de Créteil between 1907 and 1908. Marinetti is best known as the author of the first \\"Futurist Manifesto\\", which was written and published in 1909.  - Carlo Carrà (February 11, 1881  April 13, 1966) was an Italian painter and a leading figure of the Futurist movement that flourished in Italy during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition to his many paintings, he wrote a number of books concerning art. He taught for many years in the city of Milan.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Luigi Russolo (30 April 1885  6 February 1947) was an Italian Futurist painter, composer, builder of experimental musical instruments, and the author of the manifesto \\"The Art of Noises\\" (1913). He is often regarded as one of the first noise music experimental composers with his performances of noise music concerts in 191314 and then again after World War I, notably in Paris in 1921. He designed and constructed a number of noise-generating devices called Intonarumori.  - Futurism was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, and violence, and objects such as the car, the aeroplane, and the industrial city. Although it was largely an Italian phenomenon, there were parallel movements in Russia, England, Belgium and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even Futurist meals. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, Antonio Sant'Elia, Bruno Munari, Benedetta Cappa and Luigi Russolo, the Russians Natalia Goncharova, Velimir Khlebnikov, Igor Severyanin, David Burliuk, Aleksei Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Belgian Jules Schmalzigaug and the Portuguese Almada Negreiros. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past. Cubism contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style. Important Futurist works included Marinetti's \\"Manifesto of Futurism\\", Boccioni's sculpture \\"Unique Forms of Continuity in Space\\", and Balla's painting \\"Abstract Speed + Sound\\" (pictured). To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and to a greater degree Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism.  - Unique Forms of Continuity in Space is a bronze Futurist sculpture by Umberto Boccioni. It is seen as an expression of movement and fluidity. The sculpture is depicted on the obverse of the Italian-issue 20 cent euro coin.  - Art Deco, or Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I. It became popular in the 1920s and 1930s, and influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for \\"Arts Décoratifs\\", from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925. It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.  - Antonio Sant'Elia (30 April 1888  10 October 1916) was an Italian architect and a key member of the Futurist movement in architecture. He left behind almost no completed works of architecture and is primarily remembered for his bold sketches and influence on modern architecture.  - Giacomo Balla ( July 18 , 1871 -- March 1 , 1958 ) was an art teacher , painter and poet and participated later in Futurism . In his art he created a pictorial depiction of light , movement and speed .  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - Natalia Sergeevna Goncharova (June 21, 1881  October 17, 1962) was a Russian avant-garde artist, painter, costume designer, writer, illustrator, and set designer.  - Igor Severyanin (pen name, real name Igor Vasilyevich Lotaryov (  ) (May 16, 1887, Petersburg  December 20, 1941, Tallinn) was a Russian poet who presided over the circle of the so-called Ego-Futurists.  - Umberto Boccioni (19 October 1882  17 August 1916) was an influential Italian painter and sculptor. He helped shape the revolutionary aesthetic of the Futurism movement as one of its principal figures. Despite his short life, his approach to the dynamism of form and the deconstruction of solid mass guided artists long after his death. His works are held by many public art museums, and in 1988 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York organized a major retrospective of 100 pieces.  - Viktor Vladimirovich Khlebnikov, better known by the pen name Velimir Khlebnikov ( 28 June 1922), was a poet and playwright, a central part of the Russian Futurist movement, but his work and influence stretch far beyond it.  - Aleksei Eliseevich Kruchenykh or Kruchonykh or Kruchyonykh (21 February 1886  17 June 1968), a well-known poet of the Russian \\"Silver Age\\", was perhaps the most radical poet of Russian Futurism, a movement that included Vladimir Mayakovsky, David Burliuk and others. Together with Velimir Khlebnikov, Kruchenykh is considered the inventor of \\"zaum\\". Kruchenykh wrote the libretto for the Futurist opera \\"Victory Over the Sun\\", with sets provided by Kazimir Malevich. He married Olga Rozanova, an avant-garde artist, in 1912.  - Jules Schmalzigaug (Antwerp, 1882 or 1883 (the sources have different data)  The Hague, 13 May 1917) was a Belgian futurist painter.  - Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes. Violence in many forms is preventable.

For much of his life he divided his time between Paris and Rome. He was associated with neo-classicism and the \\"return to order\\" in the decade after the First World War. During his career he worked in a variety of media, including mosaic and fresco. He showed his work at major exhibitions, including the Rome Quadrennial, and won art prizes from major institutions.  - David Davidovich Burliuk (  ; 21 July 1882  15 January 1967) was a Russian and Ukrainian Futurist, Neo-Primitivist, book illustrator, publicist, and author associated with Russian Futurism. Burliuk is often described as \\"the father of Russian Futurism.\\"  - Giacomo Balla (18 July 1871  1 March 1958) was an Italian painter, art teacher and poet best known as a key proponent of Futurism. In his painting he depicted light, movement and speed.  - DaDa is the fifteenth studio album by Alice Cooper. It was originally released in September 1983, on the label Warner Bros.. \\"DaDa\\" would be Cooper's last album until his sober re-emergence in 1986 with the album \\"Constrictor\\". The album's theme is ambiguous, however, ongoing themes in the songs' lyrics suggest that the main character in question, Sonny, suffers from mental illness, resulting in the creation of many different personalities. The album alludes strongly to the dadaist movement: its cover was based on a painting by Salvador Dalí titled \\"Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire\\". Produced by long-time collaborator Bob Ezrin, at the time his first production with Cooper in six years, \\"DaDa\\" was recorded at ESP Studios in Buttonville, Ontario, Canada.  - Vorticism was a short-lived modernist movement in British art and poetry of the early 20th century, partly inspired by Cubism. The movement was announced in 1914 in the first issue of \\"BLAST\\", which contained its manifesto and the movement's rejection of landscape and nudes in favour of a geometric style tending towards abstraction. Ultimately, it was their witnessing of unfolding human disaster in World War I that \\"drained these artists of their Vorticist zeal\\". Vorticism was based in London but was international in make-up and ambition.    What object entity has the relation of 'date of birth' with the subject 'giacomo balla'?

The sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. It's peak years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatic cult of followers. She was actually able to act, unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks, and her subsequent credits proved it. And her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique.

Ever since those first interactions we have become really close friends. Today Stuart turns 40 and I just wanted to share a few words about how remarkable a human being he is. Many of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views. He is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him. As I have grown as a person in my career, with my family, and particularly when moving to America, he has always supported yet challenged me. He is one of those rare friends that can enthusiastically validate great steps forward yet, with the same enthusiasm, illustrate mistakes too. I love the fact that we have a relationship that can be so open and honest, yet underlined with respect.

Question: Process: - Blood carried into kidney by the renal artery - Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood - The waste that is filtered out mixes with water - Become urine - Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys.  Question: suppose drinking high amounts of water happens, how will it affect low water levels in the body.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"Drinking high amounts of water significantly impacts the body's water levels, specifically in the context of renal functions and the process of urine formation. To better understand this, let's explore in more detail how the kidneys and nephrons function when water intake increases. A) More: When an individual consumes high amounts of water, the body's water levels will inevitably increase. This elevated water consumption directly influences the blood volume and, subsequently, the blood pressure. As the blood pressure escalates, renal blood flow (the blood carried into the kidneys by the renal artery) also increases. As more blood flows into the kidneys, the rate at which blood is filtered by the nephrons escalates as well. In response, the kidneys work to maintain an optimal level of water and electrolytes (such as sodium) within the body. Consequently, there is an increased production of urine. The surplus water ingested mixes with the waste products filtered out of the blood, leading to the formation of a larger volume of diluted urine. This diluted urine has lower concentrations of waste, as the additional water absorbed by the body helps dissolve excess salts and other substances. Therefore, in this situation, there will likely be an increased frequency in urination or larger volumes of urine being produced, effectively decreasing the low water levels in the individual's body. This is an essential process as it helps maintain overall body fluid balance and prevents overhydration, which can lead to hyponatremia – a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by low levels of sodium in the blood. In summary, drinking high amounts of water directly affects the kidney's ability to filter blood and produce urine, leading to increased renal blood flow, greater urine production, and ultimately higher water levels in the body. So option A (more) would be the most accurate answer to how drinking high amounts of water would affect low water levels in the body. However, it's important to note that maintaining an appropriate fluid intake is vital to overall health, and drinking excessive amounts of water can potentially lead to dangerous health implications, such as hyponatremia and water intoxication."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The portraits were stored among black bags, suitcases and historical documents dating back up to 300 years. One such painting is thought to be that of William McMurty, a former resident, who died in 1963. His great nephew, Allen Sinton, spotted the portrait  on the BBC News NI website and described the \\"weird sensation\\" when he saw the familiar face of the man he knew as \\"uncle Willy\\". Mr Sinton remembered being told his great uncle lived in a residential home on the Antrim Road, but only realised the connection with Clifton House after seeing the appeal. \\"I was only about 10 or 11 whenever he passed away. But I remember him visiting the house for Sunday dinners, Christmas Day, that sort of thing. \\"I looked at the pictures and one of them jumped out at me - uncle Willy as we knew him, my father's uncle.\\" Mr McMurty, a former linen trader from Islandmagee who had family in east Belfast, resided at Clifton House from April 1953. The only picture Mr Sinton had of his great uncle was a photograph from 1930. The paintings were created by Belfast artist Tobias Everard Spence, the former president of the Belfast Charitable Society that owned Clifton House, in the 1940s and 1950s. The majority of the portraits are still without a permanent home. Most of the portraits only have small scribbled names on the back alluding to the subjects' identities. Others are completely nameless, with the society hoping keen-eyed relatives spot a family resemblance. Clifton House opened as a poor house in the 18th Century, but after World War Two, it became a home for the elderly. The secret gallery of oil paintings was found by heritage and archive manager Louise Canavan. They had been stored away when the property was renovated in 2003. The property once housed up to 100 elderly residents at a time, before the residential home relocated to more modern facilities in the 1990s. Ms Canavan said: \\"We will continue the process, it will not just finish today. \\"We plan to create a small gallery and exhibit them.\\" Those who had relatives at Clifton House between 1940 and 1980 have been urged to look at the gallery of remaining portraits and get in touch if they think they could know the subjects. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The Clifton House in Belfast found 27 old paintings of people who used to live there a long time ago. These paintings were hidden among bags and old papers for many years. The people who run Clifton House now want to give the paintings back to the families of the people in the paintings.

Answer the question...where does the umbilical vein enter the circulation of the fetus??","output":"The umbilical vein is an essential component of the fetal circulation, providing a critical pathway for oxygen and nutrient-rich blood from the placenta to reach the fetus. The entry of the umbilical vein into the fetal circulation is a crucial developmental step, ensuring that the fetus can effectively exchange gases, nutrients, and waste products with the maternal blood supply. In the developing fetus, the umbilical vein enters the circulation through a unique anatomic structure called the ductus venosus. The ductus venosus is a small, short vessel that shunts blood from the umbilical vein directly into the inferior vena cava (IVC). The IVC is a major vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body back to the heart's right atrium. By diverting the oxygen and nutrient-rich blood from the umbilical vein into the IVC, the fetal circulation ensures that this highly-oxygenated blood is mixed with the deoxygenated blood returning from the lower body. This mixture of blood (oxygenated and deoxygenated) flows into the heart, specifically to the right atrium. From the right atrium, this mixed blood enters the heart's right ventricle, where it is pumped via the pulmonary artery towards the lungs. However, because the lungs do not undergo gas exchange until after birth, the fetus relies on a unique anatomical structure called the ductus arteriosus that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta. The ductus arteriosus shunts blood directly from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the non-functioning lungs and ensuring that the richly oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein is distributed to the vital organs and tissues throughout the fetus. Ultimately, the umbilical vein plays an indispensable role in the fetal circulation, providing a crucial connection between the oxygen and nutrient-rich blood of the placenta to the developing fetus's organs and tissues. By entering the circulation through the ductus venosus and merging with the blood in the IVC, the umbilical vein ensures that the fetus remains well-nourished throughout the prenatal development period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town.

Summarize this article: Isis has enough weapons to carry on fighting for two years, UN warns      A new report prepared for the United Nations Security Council warns that the militant group known as the Islamic State (Isis) possesses sufficient reserves of small arms, ammunition and vehicles to wage its war for Syria and Iraq for up to two years.      The size and breadth of the Isis arsenal provides the group with durable mobility, range and a limited defense against low-flying aircraft. Even if the US-led bombing campaign continues to destroy the group’s vehicles and heavier weapons, the UN report states, it “cannot mitigate the effect of the significant volume of light weapons” Isis possesses.      Those weapons “are sufficient to allow [Isis] to continue fighting at current levels for six months to two years”, the UN report finds, making Isis not only the world’s best-funded terrorist group but among its best armed.      Isis, along with its former rival turned occasional tactical ally the Nusra Front, are sufficiently armed to threaten the region “even without territory”, the report concludes.      The report, months in the making, recommends the UN implement new steps to cut off Isis’s access to money and guns.      The Isis arsenal, according to the UN assessment, includes T-55 and T-72 tanks; US-manufactured Humvees; machine guns; short-range anti-aircraft artillery, including shoulder-mounted rockets captured from Iraqi and Syrian military stocks; and “extensive supplies of ammunition”. One member state, not named in the report, contends that Isis maintains a motor pool of 250 captured vehicles.      Much of the Isis weapons stocks, particularly “state of the art” weaponry stolen from the US-backed Iraqi military, was “unused” before Isis seized it, the report finds. But some of the relatively complex weapons “may be too much of a challenge” for Isis to effectively wield or maintain.      Earlier this year, speculation focussed on Isis’s potential ability to produce chemical weapons after it seized Iraqi facilities that had contributed to Saddam Hussein’s illicit weapons programs, but the UN report casts doubt on the likelihood that Isis possesses the “capability to fully exploit material it might have seized”. Nor does the UN report believe that Isis can manufacture its own chemical or other weapons of mass destruction.      But at least one anonymous member state has provided information about “chemicals and poison-coated metal balls” placed inside Isis’s homemade bombs to maximize damage. In October, Kurdish forces defending the Syrian town of Kobani from Isis reported cases of skin blistering, burning eyes and difficulty breathing after the detonation of an Isis bomb.      The UN Security Council is expected to take up consideration of the report on Wednesday.      The report recommends the UN adopt new waves of sanctions designed to disrupt the well-financed Isis’s economic health. Significant among them is a call for states bordering Isis-controlled territory to “promptly seize all oil tanker trucks and their loads” coming in or going out.      While the report warns that Isis has alternate revenue sources, and does not predict that truck seizures can eliminate Isis’s oil smuggling money, it holds out hope that raising the costs to smuggling networks and trucking companies will deter them from bringing Isis oil to market.      To combat Isis’s ability to resupply its weapons stocks and launder money, the report recommends the UN mandate that no aircraft originating from Isis-held territory can land on airstrips in member states, and to prohibit flights into Isis-held territory. Exemptions would be made for humanitarian relief planes.      The report comes on the heels of an October report to the Security Council assessing that 15,000 fighters from 80 countries have flooded into Syria and Iraq to fight alongside Isis and other militant groups.      While still months off, the US has indicated it will intensify its fight against Isis, primarily in Iraq. After doubling the US troop commitment there, defense officials have said the US will bolster 12 Iraqi and Kurdish brigades, and may even join in the Iraqi fighting for key terrain, such as the borderlands between Syria and Iraq or the city of Mosul. ||||| UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations’ top human rights official called on the Muslim world to denounce the “monstrous” crimes of the extremist group that seeks to establish an Islamic state in Iraq and Syria, calling its actions both a violation of international law and Islamic tenets.      Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, a member of the Jordanian royal family and the first Muslim to be named high commissioner for human rights, on Tuesday urged the Security Council to back efforts to overturn the Islamic State’s “ideology of violence.”      His speech was equally a message to the Muslim world.      “It is also disturbing how few to nonexistent have been the public demonstrations of anger in the Arab and Muslims worlds over the crimes being perpetrated in Iraq — notwithstanding the clear condemnation by many Arab and Islamic governments,” Mr. Al Hussein said.      Citing the opinion of Muslim clerics, he said the group had violated Shariah in many instances, through conversions, the reintroduction of slavery and the killing of civilians. He said Islam also prohibited the killing of diplomats and emissaries, which could be extended to journalists and aid workers.      His comments come as an American-led coalition expands military action against Islamic State strongholds in Iraq and Syria, but has so far been unable to stop its killing rampage. On Sunday, the Islamic State announced the beheading of an American, Peter Kassig.      On Wednesday, the Security Council is scheduled to discuss how to increase international cooperation against the Islamic State. It has already passed a measure calling on countries around the world to stop the flow of money and fighters to banned terrorist groups. A United Nations panel of experts recommended that the council crack down on the ability of the Islamic State to collect oil revenues by requiring countries to seize oil coming from Islamic State territory.      Separately, the United Nations envoy to Iraq, Nickolay E. Mladenov, said the efforts of the new Iraqi government and the American-led airstrikes were yielding some results. The bombings had destroyed some of the insurgents’ infrastructure and kept them from gaining new territory.      Mr. Mladenov said there were reports that their funds were dwindling and they were being forced to cut rations and salaries to their fighters.      Most important, he said, he was no more worried about the prospect of Iraq’s disintegration, as he had been just some months ago. “We are not looking at a collapse of Iraqi state. We’ve turned the tide,” he said.      Iraq, however, has paid a heavy price already. Since the beginning of the year, he said, 10,000 civilians have been killed and 20,000 injured.      Mr. Al Hussein, the high commissioner for human rights, said his office was also investigating the actions of the Iraqi authorities and pro-government Shia militias.      He went on to say that his office had concluded that the Islamic State had most likely violated three of five offenses that are listed under crime of genocide. He urged Iraq to consider acceding to the treaty that created the International Criminal Court and at least accept the court’s jurisdiction over possible international crimes committed in “the current situation.”      Asked about the prospects of Iraq joining the International Criminal Court, Mr. Mladenov said he, too, had encouraged the government to consider it. “This has not been overruled by the Iraqis,” he said, “but it needs to be discussed at greater length.” |||||","output":"A report from the United Nations says that the group called Islamic State (Isis) has many weapons, which will allow them to continue fighting for up to two years. The United Nations thinks that the best way to stop Isis is by not letting them get more money and guns. They suggest making new rules for countries that are near Isis to take their trucks filled with oil, and not let planes from Isis areas land in their countries. This might make it harder for Isis to sell oil and buy more weapons. The United Nations believes it is important for people in the Muslim world to speak up against the terrible things Isis does because they go against the rules of Islam.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a news article: The Republic | azcentral.com Fri Dec 27, 2013 12:05 PM      The federal government deported 368,644 people last fiscal year, a 10 percent decrease from the previous year and the first time deportations dropped since President Barack Obama took office in 2008.      The latest number includes 34,868 people deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations in Arizona, a nearly 12 percent drop from the year before.      The decrease comes as Obama has been under growing pressure from immigration advocates and some members of Congress to ease up on record deportations.      At the same time, the president has been trying to avoid appearing lax on enforcement in order to persuade Congress to pass reforms that include a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally.      Immigrant advocates say, however, that the decrease isn’t enough and vow to continue fighting deportations, while enforcement proponents say Obama’s administration should be deporting more people, not fewer.      One of the reasons Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported fewer people in 2013 is that the agency is focusing more attention on catching and removing serious criminals, whose cases take more time, ICE officials said.      An increase in the percentage of Central Americans being apprehended at the border after crossing illegally also has reduced overall deportation numbers because they take more time to deport than Mexicans, ICE officials said.      But ICE officials emphasized that 98 percent of the 368,644 people deported last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, fit into the agency’s priorities of removing criminals, recent border crossers and repeat immigration violators.      “These results clearly demonstrate that ICE is enforcing our nation’s laws in a smart and effective way,” acting ICE Director John Sandweg said in a recent conference call with reporters.      For the first time, ICE released a statistical breakdown, showing that ICE deported 133,551 people who had been apprehended from the interior of the country. Of those, Sandweg said, 82 percent had been previously convicted of a criminal offense.      The remaining 235,093 people deported last year were apprehended while attempting to enter the country illegally. Overall, nearly 60 percent of all the people deported by ICE last year were convicted of a criminal offense, he said.      “We will continue our efforts to focus on the removal of criminals and recent border crossers, promoting public safety, border security and the integrity of the immigration system,’ Sandweg said.      Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank that favors less immigration and more enforcement, challenged Sandweg’s claim that deportations are down because it takes longer to deport criminals.      She said the main reason deportations decreased last year is because, under the Obama administration, ICE has chosen to deport fewer overall people.      “Criminals don’t necessarily take longer,” Vaughan said. “In many cases, they are quicker” because, in many cases, they are already detained and so don’t have to be tracked down.      What’s more, immigrants convicted of crimes are generally less likely to contest their deportation, because they do not usually qualify for legal status, she said.      She noted that ICE has instituted policies in recent years that direct agents not to go after undocumented immigrants with children and other ties to the U.S.      The Obama administration also has put in place policies that allow undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as “dreamers,” to apply for protection from deportation, further reducing the number of people who can be deported.      “They have, by policy, exempted so many cases from their priority hierarchy that they are just looking the other way at the majority of the illegal aliens that their agents are encountering,” Vaughan said.      Deportations have represented a political tightrope for Obama, who has made passing immigration reform a top domestic priority. But to do it needs the support of Republicans, many of whom remain unconvinced the president is committed to immigration enforcement despite record levels of deportations, which climbed to 409,849 in fiscal 2012 up from 369,221 in 2008.      Earlier this month, at least 28 Democratic House members, including U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, signed a letter asking Obama to stop deporting people who might qualify for legal status and citizenship should an immigration-reform bill pass.      A bipartisan bill that included a 13-year pathway to citizenship passed the Democratic-controlled Senate in June, but it remains stalled in the Republican-controlled House.      In recent months, immigrant-advocacy groups also have blocked detention buses and staged sit-ins at immigration-enforcement facilities in more than a dozen cities, including Phoenix and Tucson.      The protests are part of a national “Not One More Deportation” campaign to pressure Obama to halt deportations until Congress passes immigration reforms that provide a path to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.      A survey by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center released this month indicated that 55 percent of Hispanics and 49 percent of Asian-Americans believe being able to live and work in the U.S. without the threat of deportation is more important than a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.      Despite the decrease in deportations, the latest numbers “are still astronomical,” said B. Loewe, a spokesman for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, one of the groups organizing the protests.      Loewe said the decrease shows that Obama’s administration has the power to stop deporting people but has instead chosen to deport record numbers of people in hopes of gaining support for immigration reform.      “The theory is that deportation was a down payment for immigration reform to bolster his enforcement credentials, but that policy has absolutely failed,” Loewe said.      Meanwhile, Loewe said, families continue to be separated.      Loewe said his group plans to continue staging protests in the coming year to pressure Obama to ease up on deportations.      “A 10 percent drop in already record-number deportations is little salve for the deep wound that his deportation policy has already caused,” Loewe said. ||||| In New Orleans, street sweeps by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents this year also led to a protest. On Nov. 14, nearly two dozen demonstrators, including 14 immigrants without legal status, tied up midday traffic at one of the city’s busiest intersections for nearly three hours until the local police arrested them.      “Our people feel they can’t go to the store to buy food or walk their children to school,” said Santos Alvarado, 51, a Honduran construction worker who joined the protest here even though he has legal papers. “We couldn’t be quiet any longer.”      Many immigrants here have been stunned by the arrests, in which some people seemed to be stopped based solely on their Latino appearance, because they had been living here uneventfully since they came in the chaotic days after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to work on reconstruction.      One of those workers, Jimmy Barraza, was unloading a carful of groceries on Aug. 16 when agents pulled up with pistols drawn, handcuffing him as well as his teenage son, a United States citizen. A mobile fingerprint check of Mr. Barraza, who is also Honduran, revealed an old court order for his deportation.      Mr. Barraza, 28, won release from detention but is still fighting to remain. His wife is a longtime legal immigrant, and he has two other younger children who are American citizens.      “If they deport me,” he said, “who will keep my son in line? Who will support my family?”      Another Honduran, Irma Lemus, was packing fishing rods for a day on the bayou when cruising immigration agents spotted her family and stopped. A fingerprint check revealed that Ms. Lemus, too, had a deportation order.      “They handcuffed me in front of my children,” she recalled, speaking of a son who is 2 and a daughter who is 4. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In fiscal year 2013, the federal government in the United States deported 368,644 individuals, representing a 10% decrease from the previous year and marking the first instance of reduced deportations under President Barack Obama's administration. Deportations conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) operations in Arizona decreased by almost 12% during this period. This decrease occurs amidst growing pressure on President Obama from immigration advocates and Congress members to minimize deportations. While the President has been attempting to strike a balance between enforcement and the passage of reforms, both proponents and opponents of stricter immigration enforcement disagree on the direction these numbers should take. ICE has been focusing on apprehending and removing severe criminals, whose cases typically require more time. However, 98% of deportations in 2013 fit the agency's priorities, which include criminals, recent border crossers, and repeat immigration violators. Acting ICE Director John Sandweg claims the agency is effectively enforcing the nation's laws, despite skepticism from critics. Additionally, the Obama administration has implemented policies allowing \\"dreamers,\\" or undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, to apply for protection from deportation, lowering the number of deportable individuals. The issue of deportations remains politically delicate, as Obama has prioritized passing immigration reform with bipartisan support.

Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \\"Munshi\\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \\"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice. Abdul Karim remained in her service until he returned to India with a pension on her death. What was Abdul Karim teaching Queen Victoria after his promotion?","output":"After his promotion, Abdul Karim became Queen Victoria's \\"Munshi,\\" a term that means teacher or instructor in the context of this relationship. In this role, Abdul Karim was primarily teaching Queen Victoria the Hindustani language, which is also known as Hindi-Urdu and served as a lingua franca in India during that time.  Queen Victoria took great interest in learning Hindustani and deepening her understanding of Indian culture, partially due to her role as the Empress of India. This interest was fueled by her close relationship with Abdul Karim, which led him to become an influential figure in the royal court.  Apart from teaching her Hindustani, Abdul Karim also acted as a clerk for Queen Victoria, assisting with official correspondence and other administrative duties. His close relationship with the Queen, however, sparked resentment and accusations of espionage among her family members and court officials, as they disapproved of his rapid rise in influence and rank. Despite the controversies surrounding Abdul Karim's place in the royal household, Queen Victoria valued his services highly and defended him against any criticism. This demonstrates her personal commitment to fostering a deeper understanding between the British Empire and India, as well as her inclination to nurture and maintain close relationships with her servants. Abdul Karim remained in Queen Victoria's service until her death, after which he returned to India with a pension."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPT: [1]. unacceptable; [2]. acceptable;","output":"[2]. Acceptable. The sentence \\"I'm going out, wherever that hurricane might be\\" is grammatically acceptable by a linguist according to the English language. Although it somewhat relies on the context for precise interpretation, it meets all the general linguistic criteria for English.  Let's break it down: 1. Sentences Structure: The given sentence comprises two clauses. The first clause is \\"I'm going out\\", which is a complete sentence itself. It includes a subject \\"I\\" and a predicate \\"am going out\\", which makes it an independent clause. The other clause is \\"wherever that hurricane might be\\", which in this case acts as an adverbial clause, specifying the condition of the action. Although it doesn't state a specific condition, it correctly uses the conjunction \\"wherever\\" to link it to the main clause providing a condition under which the main action will occur.  2. Subject-Verb Agreement: In both clauses, the subject and verb agreement is properly maintained. In the first clause, the subject is \\"I\\" and the verb is \\"am going out\\". In the second clause, \\"that hurricane\\" is the subject and \\"might be\\" is the verb. The verb \\"might\\" is a modal verb here, used to indicate possibility. 3. Coherence: The given sentence has coherence in it. The presence of the comma correctly breaks the sentence into two parts and maintains its coherence. The usage of the pronoun \\"that\\" before \\"hurricane\\" might imply that the speaker and the listener both know about some specific hurricane, making the sentence contextually coherent. While the sentence might not be seen as a common or typical way to express intention or a plan, it is still grammatically correct. What it seems to convey is that the speaker is determined to go out regardless of the location of the hurricane, which while presenting a somewhat peculiar context, does not make the sentence unacceptable from a linguistic point of view.  Therefore, the strictest standards of a linguist would consider this sentence acceptable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: If the temperature was really high, what is a likely reason for awaking in the middle of the night and being unable to fall back asleep?  Choices:  - having to pee - discomfort - depression - irritability - shock  The rationale to choose \\"discomfort\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given choices - having to pee - discomfort - depression - irritability - shock Step 2: Consider the relationship between high temperature and each choice A. Having to pee - Although needing to use the bathroom can cause one to wake up, there is no direct correlation between high temperatures and needing to pee. B. Discomfort - High temperatures can cause physical discomfort due to excessive sweating, stuffiness, and an overall sense of being too warm, which can affect sleep quality. C. Depression - While depression can result in sleep disturbances, there's no direct relationship between high temperatures and depression. D. Irritability - High temperatures may cause irritability, but it is less likely to be the reason for waking up in the middle of the night and being unable to fall back asleep. E. Shock - Shock is an extreme reaction that typically results from a traumatic experience or severe injury, and is not directly related to high temperatures. Step 3: Assess the most probable reason for awaking in the middle of the night due to high temperature Out of all the options discussed in Step 2, \\"discomfort\\" appears to be the most likely reason for awaking in the middle of the night and being unable to fall back asleep when the temperature is really high.

When he put this amazing creation in front of me, I thought he must have ESP or I had the words \\"love strawberries\\" written on my forehead cause this was a strawberry margarita.  Turns out he talked to my husband and found out about my strawberry obsession.  I asked him what he called it and he asked what my name was and the name of the drink was Leanne's Surprise.  Don't ask me what was in it cause I can't remember but it was wonderful.  Thanks again Jason.

Next time I go I will try for sunset.  I ordered their off menu special the NY Strip. I'm normally a filet kind of gal but I wanted the potatoes and shrimp as well. So our server did the bacon wrapped filet with the sides of the special. So happy he did that for me. It was amazing. I posted a picture of it.

Here is a question about this article: According to John Everett-Heath, the author of Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names, Hyderabad means \\"Haydar's city\\" or \\"lion city\\", from haydar (lion) and ābād (city). It was named to honour the Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, who was also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battles.

One popular theory suggests that Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of the city, named it \\"Bhagyanagar\\" or \\"Bhāgnagar\\" after Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing) girl with whom he had fallen in love. She converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder Mahal. The city was renamed Hyderabad in her honour. According to another source, the city was named after Haidar, the son of Quli Qutb Shah.

Aodh Mac Cathmhaoil, O.F.M., (Latin: Hugo Cavellus; anglicised: Hugh MacCaghwell) (1571 – 22 September 1626), was an Irish Franciscan theologian and Archbishop of Armagh. He was known by Irish speakers at Louvain by the honorary name \\"Aodh Mac Aingil\\" (\\"Mac Aingil\\" is Irish for \\"Son of an Angel\\"), and it was under this title that he published the Irish work \\"Scáthán Shacramuinte na hAthridhe\\". Can we infer the following? Aodh Mac Cathmhaoil died in September 22","output":"Yes, we can infer that Aodh Mac Cathmhaoil, also known as Hugh MacCaghwell, died on September 22, 1626. He was an Irish Franciscan theologian and Archbishop of Armagh, and he was well-known by various names and titles due to his work and linguistic abilities. Aodh Mac Cathmhaoil was born in 1571, during a time when Ireland was facing significant political, religious, and social upheaval. As a member of the Franciscan Order, he was part of a long tradition of Irish Catholic scholars and theologians who sought to preserve the Irish language and culture while also engaging with the broader European intellectual community. This was particularly important during the 16th and 17th centuries, as the English Crown sought to impose its Protestant faith on Ireland, and Irish Catholics were increasingly marginalized and persecuted. While studying at the University of Salamanca, Mac Cathmhaoil joined the Franciscan Order and later went on to the Irish Franciscan College at Leuven (Louvain) in present-day Belgium. The College was a center of Irish Catholic scholarship in exile, offering a refuge for Irish clergy, theologians, and scholars who faced persecution from the English Crown and its allies. Throughout his career, Mac Cathmhaoil became renowned for his knowledge of theology and his skills in languages, including Latin, Irish, Greek, Hebrew, and Spanish. As a result of his exemplary learning and devotion to his faith, he was made a professor of theology at Leuven, where he served as an inspiring mentor to many aspiring Irish theologians. One of his most notable achievements was the publication of the Irish-language work \\"Scáthán Shacramuinte na hAthridhe\\" (The Mirror of theSacrament of Penance), which was given the honorary title \\"Aodh Mac Aingil\\" (\\"Son of an Angel\\") by Irish speakers at Louvain. This work, written in 1618, was an important achievement in Irish biblical scholarship, as it translated a Latin theological text into the Irish language for the first time.  As a distinguished scholar and leader of the Irish Catholic community in Europe, Mac Cathmhaoil was eventually appointed Archbishop of Armagh in 1626. The appointment came at a critical moment in Irish history, as the \\"Catholic Revival\\" sought to renew the faith, defend the Catholic Church in Ireland, and ultimately resist the efforts of the English Crown to suppress Irish culture and religion. Unfortunately, Mac Cathmhaoil did not live to see the long-term effects of his efforts, as he passed away on September 22, 1626. His legacy, however, remains an important part of the history of the Irish Catholic Church, as well as a testament to the resilience and determination of Irish scholars and theologians during a challenging era in Irish history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This honorable follow-up to LaBute's stunning debut, In the Company of Men, which also dissects sexual politics, is well acted by the entire ensemble. 6.

But it seems that four out of five young people now get on well with their parents, which is the opposite of the popularly-held image of unhappy teenagers locked in their room after endless family quarrels. An important new study into teenage attitudes surprisingly shows that their family life is more harmonious than it had ever been in the past. \\"We were surprised by just how positive today's young people seem to be about their families,\\" said one number of the research team. \\"They're expected to be rebellious and selfish but actually they have other things on their minds: they want a car and material goods, and they worry about whether school is serving them well. There's more negotiation and discussion between parents and children, and children expect to take part in the family decision-making process. They don't want to rock the boat.\\" So it seems that this generation of parents is much more likely than parents of 30 years ago to treat their children as friends. \\"My parents are happy to discuss things with me and willing to listen to me,\\" says 17-year-old Daniel Lazall. \\"I always tell them when I'm going out clubbing. As long as they know what I'm doing, they're fine with me.\\" Susan Crome, who is now 21, agrees. \\"Looking back on the last 10 years, there was a lot of what you could call negotiation. For example, as long as I'd done all my homework, I could go out on a Saturday night. But I think my grandparents were a lot stricter with my parents than that.\\" Maybe this positive view of family life should not be unexpected. It is possible that the idea of teenage rebellion is not rooted in real facts. A researcher comments, \\"Our surprise that teenagers say they get along well with their parents comes because of a brief period in our social history when teenagers were regarded as different beings. But that idea of rebelling and breaking away from their parents really happened during that one time in the 1960s when everyone rebelled. The normal...

He acknowledged that climate change was a serious problem and said the company would support a tax on the carbon content of fuels, but he said that only oil and gas could meet the world’s needs as the population grows and living standards rise.      “We have to have some technology breakthroughs, but in the meantime, just saying �?turn the taps off’ is not acceptable to humanity,” he said.      The biggest U.S. oil and gas company has been in the crosshairs of environmental groups probing whether ExxonMobil knew as early as four decades ago the scope of climate change and whether it should be held accountable for harm caused by the burning of fossil fuels.      New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and at least four other attorneys general are investigating the company’s climate policies.      The most successful of the climate-related shareholder resolutions garnered 38.2 percent of the voting shares. Sponsored by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, holding nearly 11 million Exxon shares, the measure would have forced ExxonMobil to report annually on how climate change could affect the company’s ability to operate.      Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, had argued that the company should have a scenario with “stress tests” as global warming approaches 2 degrees Celsius. He noted that BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total have agreed to issue such reports.      Many critics of ExxonMobil note that while the company says it cares about climate change, it provides funding to trade and lobbying groups that deny or play down its effects. So the United Steelworkers proposed full disclosure of the company’s direct and indirect lobbying expenditures. The measure won support from 25.8 percent of the voting shares.      Tillerson said that the company would continue to fund groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group that works mostly at the state and local levels. Tillerson said that Exxon “found our engagement with them to be very productive,” and said “whether we agree or not, we find it very useful.”      ALEC is working to roll back renewable-energy requirements that have been adopted by the majority of state governments.      In 2013, ALEC offered model legislation, as it is known, to state legislators asserting that the science was uncertain about the role of human activity in changing the atmosphere.      A motion to install a board member with expertise on climate change won 20.9 percent of shares cast.      Other shareholders said that if the international community were to stick to its target of limiting climate change to 2 degrees Celsius, much of ExxonMobil’s 25 billion barrels of proved oil reserves and natural gas equivalents would be stranded and useless.      Tillerson said that there was “no scientific basis” for establishing an international target of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius and that it was a societal choice. Such choices, he added, must be “grounded in reality. No energy source available on the planet” would be able to sustain “our economies, our way of life or, I would say, our very survival.”      He said energy-efficiency measures would keep down greenhouse-gas emissions, but he said that by 2040 oil and gas would still account for 60 percent of global energy needs, about the same percentage as today.      Not everyone who attended the meeting cared about climate issues. One man, choking up, said, “You personify all that is best in America” and added that “the lives of all of us shareholders are more secure and, in return, happier because of you.”      But most speakers dealt with the resolutions in the proxy.      Sister Patricia A. Daly, a Dominican nun who is executive director of the New Jersey-based Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment, advocated a measure that would request the Exxon board to commit to supporting the goal of limiting warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius.      Daly said, “as the world moves forward, ExxonMobil stands still.” ||||| Rex Tillerson, the boss of oil giant ExxonMobil, said cutting oil production was “not acceptable for humanity” as he fought off shareholders’ and activists’ attempts to force the company to fully acknowledge the impact of climate change on the environment and Exxon’s future profits.      During a long and fractious annual meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, Tillerson, who serves as Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, beat back several proposals to force the company to take more action on climate change.      However, dissident shareholders won a vote that could make it easier for them to propose board candidates concerned about climate change and remove incumbent directors.      Tillerson said Exxon had invested 7bn in green technology, but the science and technology had not yet achieved the breakthroughs needed to compete with fossil fuels. “Until we have those, just saying ‘turn the taps off’ is not acceptable to humanity,” he said. “The world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not.”      ExxonMobil tried to censor climate scientists to Congress during Bush era Read more      Tillerson’s presentation at the meeting showed that Exxon believes oil and gas will still provide about 60% of the world’s energy demands by 2040, even if countries adopt climate change proposals agreed in Paris last year.      His comments came after investors urged Exxon, the world’s largest oil company, with a market value of 374bn (£254bn), to reduce carbon extraction or at least warn investors about how global governmental action against climate change could affect the viability of its fossil fuel assets.      More than 38% of Exxon’s investors rebelled against the company by voting for a proposal that would have required the company to publish an annual study of how its profits may be affected by public climate change policies, following the Paris climate agreement, to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2C (3.6F).      A similar vote at Chevron’s annual shareholder meeting, also held on Wednesday, showed 41% support from Chevron investors that cast ballots.      Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church of England, who proposed the resolution, said he was delighted at the “very significant shareholder revolt on climate change”.      “Considering the scale of this vote, we urge Exxon to sit down urgently with its investors to agree the reporting it will provide on the risk that climate change policy poses to its business. Following the Paris agreement, the time for climate risk reporting has well and truly arrived and the investor call for it is clear. It will not go away.”      Mason, who helps manage £6.7bn of assets for the Church Commissioners for England, said it wasn’t just the environment that was at risk, but also the billions of dollars invested in Exxon, if it does not adapt quickly to a changing world. “The financial risks of not acting are very real,” he said.      Exxon had tried to block the resolution from being heard at its meeting, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulator ruled that it must include the resolution among Wednesday’s votes.      “Given the significant resources Exxon spent fighting this proposal, such a strong vote is a real rebuke to company management,” said Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas for Ceres, a coalition of sustainable investment groups. “Investors have sent a clear message that meaningful 2 degree stress testing is the new normal, and companies like Exxon and Chevron can no longer act as if nothing has changed.”      Tillerson, who was paid 23.4m last year, also suffered an investor backlash over his current position as both chairman and CEO. Some 38.8% of investors voted for a resolution asking that the company appoint an independent chairman when Tillerson stands down. He is due to retire before his 65th birthday, in March 2017.      Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement for Arjuna Capital, who proposed one of the motions, said: “While the business plan of extracting as much carbon as possible was a winner last century, it will destroy value this century, and already has.”      The Guardian was banned from reporting from inside the meeting, and instead listened to proceedings via webcast. “We are denying your request because of the Guardian’s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting, demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers,” a spokesman said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"ExxonMobil recently faced challenges from shareholders with regard to its actions on climate change.

The key in destroying the drain fly's breeding ground is removing all hair, grime, and debris that the flies might lay their eggs in. Pour 1 to 2 gallons (4 to 8 liters) of warm water into the drain to moisten it slightly. Note that this is only needed if the drain is not used on a regular basis. Drains used on a daily basis are moist enough without taking additional measurements. Work a metal pipe brush into the drain, extending it as far down into the drain as possible. Twist the brush while slowly moving it up and down to remove grime from the sides of the pipe. Insert a plumbing snake into the drain and twist it through the pipes to pull out clumps of grime that lie further down. Apply roughly 4 oz (125 ml) of the cleaner around the edge of the drain.  Applying the cleaner to the edge of the drain allows it to coat the sides of the drain and pipe as it glides down. Gel cleaners are formulated to remove organic matter. You could also use enzyme or bacterial drain cleaners to remove organic material.  Vinegar, boiling water, and bleach are traditional remedies for getting rid of drain flies, but many experts insist that these methods are not effective.  Baking soda and vinegar poured down the drain may kill the flies; it will clean the drain at least. You may need to repeat the same dosage of drain cleaner once a day for five to seven days total. After the drain cleaner has sat in the sink for several hours, flush it through with plenty of water. Use a plunger to remove any remaining organic matter trapped in the sink.

Conan’s team says that they were unaware of Alex Kaseberg's jokes until after they’d written their own. USA TODAY      Conan O'Brien at City Hall in Oslo, Norway, Dec. 10, 2016. (Photo: VEGARD WIVESTAD, EPA)      It could be the next big celebrity trial: Conan O'Brien defending himself and his writers in federal civil court against accusations of \\"joke-stealing\\" — the worst thing you could say about a comedian, according to O'Brien.      But don't go signing up for courtroom tickets just yet. Experts in copyright law say the 2-year-old copyright infringement lawsuit filed against O'Brien, his writers for his late-night show, Conan, and Time Warner over a handful of topical jokes may never get before a jury, despite a ruling by a judge that the case can proceed.      The stakes are high, not just in time and litigation costs but in \\"reputational\\" costs: No comedian wants to be known as a joke thief. \\"Accusing a comedian of stealing a joke is the worst thing you can accuse them of, in my opinion, short of murder,\\" O'Brien said in a deposition in the case. \\"I think it's absolutely terrible.\\"      Thus, O'Brien and the plaintiff in the case, a freelance joke writer in San Diego named Robert \\"Alex\\" Kaseberg, have to weigh the risks and benefits of going to trial and possibly losing, or negotiating a settlement that could leave a whiff of suspected thievery in the Conan writers' room.      \\"Comics rarely sue one another, and to some degree this case illustrates why,\\" says New York University law professor Christopher Sprigman , a leading expert in intellectual property law involving comedy. \\"The judge (in the O'Brien case) ruled the case could go forward but the ruling makes it difficult\\" for the plaintiff to prevail.      New York intellectual property lawyer and mediator Arnie Herz says the ruling showed the judge \\"did not say that anyone did anything wrong, she was saying there was enough to go to a jury.\\"      But will it? It's impossible to predict, Sprigman says, but settling could be tricky for O'Brien.      \\"Among comics, joke stealing is really, really bad behavior — no one wants to go down as a joke thief, so the settlement has to make absolutely clear that no one is admitting any wrongdoing,\\" Sprigman says. \\"(O'Brien) has got to worry about how his fellow comedians would react to that.\\"      \\"It's no joking matter,\\" cracks Herz, who says most IP cases are settled before trial. If a \\"reasonable settlement\\" can be achieved, it behooves all involved to resolve the case, he says.      \\"There are strong economic reasons to resolve this (before trial) because these are not easy cases to prevail, there are high standards plaintiffs have to prove,\\" says Herz. \\"At a trial, it depends on how a jury views the plaintiff and Conan O'Brien. The plaintiff and his lawyers could end up with nothing, so they don't want to put in a ton of time and money and end up losing.\\"      O'Brien's legal woes were on display Monday after U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino ruled Friday that a jury can decide whether O'Brien and his writers stole three jokes dealing with Tom Brady, Caitlyn Jenner and the Washington Monument from Kaseberg's social media feed and blog between December 2014 and June 2015. (Two other jokes were dropped from the case.)      The Brady joke had Brady giving his MVP truck \\"to the man who won the game for Patriots\\" — Pete Carroll. The Jenner joke involved Caitlyn's gender transition and towns with streets named after Bruce Jenner. And the Washington Monument jibe was a penis joke based on news that the obelisk is actually 10 inches shorter than previously thought and maybe it was due to cold weather.      But the judge warned that jokes based on current events and news are entitled only to \\"thin\\" copyright protection — meaning the jokes in question have to be virtually identical in order to find a defendant guilty of copyright infringement, says Sprigman. Also, a jury would have to conclude that the defendant had access to the jokes and willfully copied them, Herz adds.      Conan O'Brien during the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, Dec. 11, 2016. (Photo: JON OLAV, EPA)      Unlike patents, creators can't get ownership of ideas or facts or events on which jokes are based, only the manner in which they are expressed, Herz says. Plus, the allegedly stolen joke has to be \\"fixed\\" in a tangible means of expression, either recorded or published.      \\"If it turns out the jokes copied from a Twitter feed were virtually identical to the jokes as told (by O'Brien), then maybe he wants to take the reputational hit and settle,\\" Sprigman says.\\"If there's doubt about whether they were copied or are identical, he could go to trial and roll the dice. It’s a pickle no matter what.\\"      Intellectual property lawsuits involving comedy are exceedingly rare; it's been \\"decades and decades\\" since the last one, says Sprigman, co-author of a 2008 paper, There's No Free Laugh (Anymore): The Emergence of Intellectual Property Norms and the Transformation of Stand-Up Comedy, that explored how comedians protect their jokes against thieves by enforcing their own comedy-community norms, and not through intellectual property law.      He and his co-author, Dotan Oliar, interviewed comedians, their lawyers and their agents, and found that comics have long employed out-of-court means of addressing accusations of theft.      \\"They typically handle it through community policing, they have a set of norms on joke thievery and they enforce them through various means,\\" Sprigman says. \\"Copyright lawsuits typically don’t work that well (in these cases) — they're expensive and often they don't have good results for plaintiffs.\\"      Neither O'Brien nor his lawyers returned messages from USA TODAY. Same for Kaseberg and his lawyer.      But on Wednesday, O'Brien's publicists at 42 West in New York issued a statement on his behalf in an email to USA TODAY from Amanda Nesbitt: \\"We are very pleased that the court has granted summary judgment and dismissed two of the jokes at issue. We can't comment further on pending litigation, but we are extremely confident that once the facts are presented to a jury, we will be fully vindicated.\\"      Kaseberg said on his blog he's a comedy writer who's contributed hundreds of jokes to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno for 20 years. In a February 2015 post, he describes his version of how his jokes allegedly were stolen by O'Brien's writers.      \\"The only consolation I can take from this horrifying violation is I wrote three jokes that were good enough to be on the monologue on Conan. And they all got good laughs,\\" he said. \\"Since I cannot watch the show again – it is too painful – and I have lost respect for one of my comedy idols, that consolation will have to be enough.\\"      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rjBrAh |||||       Conan O’Brien makes an appearance at Harvard University on Feb. 12, 2016. (Charles Krupa/AP)      U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino recently refused to toss out an unusual lawsuit accusing late-night host Conan O’Brien and his writing staff of stealing jokes from a professional joke writer’s blog and Twitter feed, claiming some were entitled to “thin copyright protection.”      Robert “Alex” Kaseberg, a writer who has penned more than 1,000 jokes for Jay Leno, accused O’Brien of telling five of his jokes in his monologue on “Conan.” Kaseberg said he wrote and posted the jokes online between Dec. 2, 2014, and June 9, 2015.      Kaseberg wrote on his blog he was convinced O’Brien’s team was stealing his material after the third time he heard the comedian tell a joke he had recently posted.      “Two times there is an impossibly slight possibility of a joke-writing coincidence, three times there is no possibility of a coincidence,” he wrote. “And always used on the monologue one day or, in the case of the third time, six hours after it appeared on my blog and or Twitter.”      Kaseberg said he reached out to O’Brien’s writing team but was rebuked. He then filed suit against O’Brien, his writing staff, Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner in July 2015. O’Brien and the other parties denied any joke theft and requested that the case be dismissed.      In her opinion issued Friday, the judge allowed the suit to proceed to trial but threw out two jokes. The suit will proceed on the other three.      The judge noted the difficulty of proving that a joke was stolen.      “Facts, of course, are not protected by copyright,” she wrote. “And although the punchlines of the jokes are creative, they are nonetheless constrained by the limited number of variations that would (1) be humorous (2) as applied to the specific facts articulated in each joke’s previous sentence and (3) provide mass appeal. This merits only thin protection.”      Because of such “thin protection,” there has not been an intellectual property lawsuit concerning comedy in “decades and decades,” New York University law professor Christopher Sprigman told USA Today.      “Comics rarely sue one another, and to some degree this case illustrates why,” he added. “The judge ruled the case could go forward but the ruling makes it difficult” for Kaseberg to win.      Even so, Kaseberg’s lawyer, Jayson Lorenzo, called the ruling “a victory for comedy writers, especially lesser known writers,” in a statement to the New York Times.      The three jokes in question, according to court documents:      The Tom Brady joke      Kaseberg: “Tom Brady said he wants to give his MVP truck to the man who won the game for the Patriots. So enjoy that truck, Pete Carroll.”      O’Brien: “Tom Brady said he wants to give the truck that he was given as Super Bowl MVP … to the guy who won the Super Bowl for the Patriots. Which is very nice. I think that’s nice. I do. Yes. So Brady’s giving his truck to Seahawks coach Pete Carroll.”      The Caitlyn Jenner joke      Kaseberg: “Three towns, two in Texas, one in Tennessee, have streets named after Bruce Jenner and now they have to consider changing them to Caitlyn. And one will have to change from a Cul-De-Sac to a Cul-De-Sackless.”      O’Brien: “Some cities that have streets named after Bruce Jenner are trying to change the streets’ names to Caitlyn Jenner. If you live on Bruce Jenner Cul-de-sac it will now be Cul-de-no-sack.”      The Washington Monument joke      Kaseberg: “The Washington Monument is ten inches shorter than previously thought. You know the winter has been cold when a monument suffers from shrinkage.”      O’Brien: “Yesterday surveyors announced that the Washington Monument is ten inches shorter than what’s been previously recorded. Yeah. Of course, the monument is blaming the shrinkage on the cold weather.”      “The only consolation I can take from this horrifying violation is I wrote three jokes that were good enough to be on the monologue on ‘Conan.’ And they all got good laughs,” Kaseberg wrote on his blog in 2015. “Since I cannot watch the show again — it is too painful — and I have lost respect for one of my comedy idols, that consolation will have to be enough.”      O’Brien also appeared to be emotionally affected by the situation.      “Accusing a comedian of stealing a joke is the worst thing you can accuse them of, in my opinion, short of murder,” O’Brien said during a deposition in the case, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “I think it’s absolutely terrible.”      The trial is on pace to take place in August, CBS reported.

From the fog emerge two pedestrians: King Arthur (Graham Chapman), dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown; and Patsy (Terry Gilliam), who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussively.They approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop. Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconuts. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics.

Information:  - The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the East and West from China to the Mediterranean Sea.  - The Norwegian School of Economics or NHH is a business school situated in Bergen, Norway. Opened in 1936 by King Haakon VII, it is Norway's oldest business school and has since its foundation been a leading Norwegian teaching and research institution in the fields of economics and business administration. The school celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2011.  - International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories. It is the exchange of goods and services among nations of the world. In most countries, such trade represents a significant share of gross domestic product (GDP). While international trade has existed throughout history (for example Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, salt roads), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries.  - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.  - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank.  - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Jan Ingvald Meidell Haaland ( born February 18 , 1956 ) is the rector of the Norwegian School of Economics ( NHH ) . He succeeded Per Ivar Gjærum in August 2005 . Haaland is also professor of economics . His research has mainly focused on questions related to international trade . After growing up in Stavanger , Haaland was an educated siv.øk . from NHH in 1979 and continued on to receive a Doctor of Philosophy from the same institution in 1984 . In addition to working at NHH he has worked at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , the University of Cambridge and the University of Southampton .

It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.  - The Amber Road was an ancient trade route for the transfer of amber from coastal areas of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Prehistoric trade routes between Northern and Southern Europe were defined by the amber trade. As an important raw material, sometimes dubbed \\"the gold of the north\\", amber was transported from the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts overland by way of the Vistula and Dnieper rivers to Italy, Greece, the Black Sea, Syria and Egypt thousands of years ago, and long after.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.    What is the relationship between 'jan haaland' and 'norway'?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article that answers the following question: Which does Oats remove at a faster rate of pound per bushel, P2O5 or K2O?","output":"Title: Oats and Their Amazing Ability to Remove Nutrients Hey kids! Today, we're going to talk about something super interesting: oats! You know, those little things that you often eat for breakfast as oatmeal or maybe in a yummy granola bar. Well, oats are not just delicious, but they also help the soil become better for growing plants. They do this by removing certain nutrients, and today we're going to find out which nutrient oats remove more quickly between P2O5 and K2O. First, let's learn what these nutrients are. P2O5 is called \\"Phosphorus\\" and K2O is called \\"Potassium\\". They both sound like superheroes, don't they? Phosphorus and Potassium are very important for plants and they help them grow strong and healthy. Now, back to oats. When oat plants grow in the soil, they are like superheroes that remove or \\"eat up\\" those nutrients, Phosphorus (P2O5) and Potassium (K2O). Just like you need fruits, vegetables, and other foods to grow and be strong, plants need nutrients to grow too! So, which nutrient does Oats remove faster? Drumroll, please! The answer is: Oats remove Potassium (K2O) at a faster rate than Phosphorus (P2O5). That means they are better at cleaning up Potassium from the soil. This is great because it can help make the soil healthier and better for other plants to grow! Isn't it amazing that something so yummy and small like oats can help the environment and make our gardens a better place? So next time you eat your oatmeal or munch on a granola bar, remember the awesome power of oats and their ability to remove nutrients from the soil! In conclusion, oats are amazing little superheroes that help make the soil better by removing Potassium (K2O) at a faster rate than Phosphorus (P2O5). Next time you see oats, remember their special powers and how they help our gardens and farms. Happy eating, and don't forget to thank oats for their hard work!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

It is to enjoy that he watches a show, unless he/she is a critic or a person who analyzes story. But most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office/school. It makes you laugh and it is not just humor. Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If any such family existed in real world, it would be a role model for us to follow. But this is a TV show, and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television. The very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, whatever be the comments later on. Another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it, but would take back a message however childish that message be. Those Jesse's talks with Michelle are extremely touching, if one doesn't think of it as childish.

That was the first thing I wondered when I realized that he was n't joking . \\" He gazed at Goku again . \\" I suppose I 'll level with you ; we all know that Sanzo has not been himself lately . \\" Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why is the narrator wary of Sanzo 's recent behavior ?","output":"The narrator expresses wariness towards Sanzo's recent behavior due to multiple reasons. Based on the passage provided, one can infer that Sanzo's demeanor or conduct has changed significantly in recent days, revealing a side of him that is uncharacteristic or unfamiliar to his peers. This sudden shift in behavior is most likely a cause for concern, prompting the narrator to crave for a better understanding of the situation. Firstly, the phrase \\"we all know that Sanzo has not been himself lately\\" suggests that the narrator and those acquainted with Sanzo can recognize the discrepancy in his behavior. They are aware of the difference between his usual self and how he has been acting of late. This understanding of Sanzo's odd behavior fuels their interest and drives their suspicion, making them wary of Sanzo's actions. Another reason for the narrator's wariness is the mention of Goku, which indicates a level of concern for him. It is possible that Sanzo's current behavior may have an impact on Goku or their mutual relationship. This added layer of concern makes it crucial for the narrator to stay vigilant and monitor the situation closely. Furthermore, the narrator seems to be contemplating sharing their thoughts and opinions on the matter. The statement \\"I suppose I'll level with you\\" indicates that they might be willing to open up and discuss their concerns, seeking external input or agreement. Engaging in such a conversation reflects their inherent worry and the need to validate their observations. This accentuates the fact that they feel uneasy and uncertain about Sanzo's recent demeanor. Lastly, the narrator's acknowledgement of Sanzo's peculiar behavior creates a sense of doubt and insecurity that is shared among their peers. This collective worry exacerbates their doubts and prompts them to investigate the situation further to find the root cause of this unexpected change in Sanzo. In conclusion, the narrator is wary of Sanzo's recent behavior primarily because of the noticeable and uncharacteristic shift in his demeanor. This change has been acknowledged by those acquainted with Sanzo, causing doubt and suspicion. The potential impact on Goku and the related relationships adds to the narrator's concern, further highlighting the need to understand and address Sanzo's unusual conduct."},{"instruction":"Kendall wanted Jan to answer earlier.

Article: Jordan Linn Graham, the Montana newlywed who pushed her husband of eight days to his death from a cliff, is appealing her own guilty plea and 30-year prison sentence.      In documents filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Missoula, attorneys for Graham indicated that they believe prosecutors and U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy reneged on a plea deal in which Graham, 22, agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder in December.      Graham's prosecution and trial were front-page news around the world last year, even landing on the cover of People magazine.      Jordan Linn Graham leaves U.S. District Court in Missoula, Mont., after a hearing in March. Arthur Mouratidis / REUTERS file      Graham unsuccessfully sought to withdraw her guilty plea after Molloy sentenced her last month to the maximum 30 years in prison even though her attorneys asked for a 10-year sentence in return for the change of plea, which came after the start of her trial.      The filing alleges that in calculating Graham's sentence, Molloy improperly added irrelevant obstruction of justice adjustments and failed to consider that her acceptance of the plea implied that she hadn't premeditated the death of Cody Johnson on July 7.      All of that adds up to \\"breach of the plea agreement,\\" they charged.      Graham admitted killing Johnson — whom she'd married just eight days before — by pushing him off a 300-foot cliff in Glacier National Park.      For days afterward, she insisted that she shoved Johnson in self-defense during an argument. But prosecutors introduced evidence showing that she'd confided to a friend that she was unhappy in the brand-new marriage, had made up a false story to account for Johnson's disappearance and concocted the scenario in which she eventually led investigators to his body.      Specifics of the calculations that went into Graham's sentence weren't immediately available Thursday night, as her court presentencing report remains under seal. ||||| The Kalispell bride who pleaded guilty to pushing her husband off a cliff in Glacier National Park eight days after their marriage filed a last-minute appeal of her 30-year, no-parole federal prison sentence.      Thursday marked Jordan Linn Graham’s deadline to file the appeal in U.S. District Court.      Graham’s attorneys, Michael Donahoe and Andrew Nelson, argued in the appeal that District Judge Donald Molloy failed to resolve the issue of premeditation that prosecutors brought forth in their sentencing arguments.      Graham was originally charged with both first- and second-degree murder, but accepted a plea agreement near the end of her December trial. Prosecutors agreed to drop the first-degree murder charge, and she pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.      In order to gain a first-degree murder conviction, prosecutors must prove the act was premeditated. Second-degree murder charge doesn’t include premeditation.      In their appeal, Graham’s attorneys argue that Molloy didn’t actually dismiss the first-degree murder charge when he sentenced Graham and that prosecutors breached the plea agreement when they suggested premeditation in their sentencing recommendations.      Prior to the March 27 sentencing, federal prosecutors Kris McLean and Zeno Baucus sought 50 years to life in prison for the 22-year-old woman. Her attorneys argued for a significantly lesser sentence of 10 years followed by supervised release.      Graham killed her husband, Cody Johnson, on July 7 during a heated argument about their young marriage. She said he grabbed her arm and she withdrew his hand, but then pushed him to his death off a 300-foot cliff in Glacier National Park.      Graham then drove home to Kalispell in her husband’s car. She eventually led a group of friends and family to his body on July 11, but concocted a story, alleging Johnson had driven off with friends from Washington on July 7 and didn’t return home that night.      After intentionally misleading law enforcement for nine days, she confessed to Johnson’s murder on July 16. |||||Summary:","output":"Jordan Linn Graham, a Montana woman who pushed her husband of eight days off a cliff, is appealing her guilty plea and 30-year prison sentence.

Here's a detailed explanation of why each option may or may not be the best choice: A. Book - While a book can be a good source of entertainment and information, it may not be the most fitting choice for waiting at a doctor's office. Books usually require a longer time commitment to fully enjoy the content. If your wait time is uncertain or you don't want to carry a book around, it might not be the most convenient option. B. Magazine Article - A magazine article is an excellent choice when waiting at the doctor's office. Magazine articles are typically shorter in length compared to books, making it easier to complete one or more articles during your waiting time. Furthermore, magazines often cover a wide range of topics, including health-related issues, which are relevant and interesting when spending time at a doctor's office. The articles are usually engaging, informative, and sometimes entertaining, providing you with a pleasant way to pass the time. C. Safe Deposit Box - A safe deposit box is not relevant to the context of the question, as it is a personal secure storage unit for valuables and important documents, not a type of literature to read for enjoyment or information. D. Hotel Menu Book - A hotel menu book is meant for browsing through food options when staying at a hotel, and thus, is not appropriate or informative reading material while waiting at a doctor's office. It likely won't hold your attention for an extended period of time and does not provide any valuable content related to your situation. E. Library - A library is not a type of literature; instead, it is a place where you can find various reading materials, including books, magazines, and newspapers. The question is seeking a type of story to read, so the answer should be a specific form of literature rather than a location that offers reading materials. In conclusion, a magazine article (Option B) is the most practical and relevant choice for a good title to read while waiting at a doctor's office. The articles are informative and concise, allowing you to engage in the content without feeling rushed or committing to a lengthy reading session."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: No grades (ever), no sitting down at desks, and harnessing student boredom as a motivator to create and explore might seem an odd recipe for academic success and entry to university, but that is exactly what one of Scotland's newest schools is attempting to do. Drumdruan Upper School was created a few years ago by Scottish actress Tilda Swinton, star of many a Hollywood blockbuster and forever in my mind the terrifying Witch in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The school extends a Steiner education beyond the age of 14, and takes students through to their University years. The Observer has published a fascinating and detailed account of some of the recipe that makes this a special place and, above all, has bowled over the traditionally conservative schools inspectorate: That is not what happened: the inspectors sat in the classes and watched the students. And if you watch the students at Drumduan, you soon notice they are confident, articulate, highly motivated and respectful. These are, in fact, the words used by the inspectors in their subsequent report. You might even believe the students at Drumduan wanted to be there. The inspectors clearly felt so, but it was when they had retired to an office to confer that Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, delivered the coup de grace. He sang to them. Music is something of a hallmark at Drumduan, where children participate in regular workshops – often on instruments like a wheelie bin – and start each day singing in four-part harmonies. “We were rehearsing in another room, and I said: ‘This song is terrific, we have to show these inspectors,’” Krzysztof recalls. “So we burst into their office – they were a bit alarmed – and I said: ‘I’m sorry, we’ve just got to sing this song to you.’” The song was “Media Vita”, a medieval score of haunting beauty that reduced the inspectors to tears, according to Krzysztof.

The song they performed was impromptu but carefully chosen due to its significance; it was a medieval score \\"Media Vita\\", known for its haunting beauty. Music is an integral part of the learning experience at Drumduan Upper School, seeping into their regular activities. Students participate in regular music workshops and start each day singing in four-part harmonies. These activities stretch their creativity and foster a sense of unity within them. Sometimes, they use unconventional instruments like a wheelie bin, teaching them innovation and resourcefulness.  Krzysztof, whom the text reveals to be a master of spontaneous gestures, saw the presence of the inspectors as an opportunity to showcase the unique aspects of the school's curriculum, including the special emphasis on music. When he had been rehearsing, he thought the song \\"Media Vita\\" was terrific and felt the need to show the inspectors, so they stormed the office the inspectors were conferring in to sing to them. The song choice was deliberate as it was a medieval score of haunting beauty, and it had a profound impact on the inspectors, reducing them to tears, according to Krzysztof's subsequent recall. The singing was also a testament to student discipline and skill, demonstrating that despite the unconventional methods of the school, the students could perform a complex four-part harmony spontaneously. The outdoor activity also demonstrated the confidence of the students, which was a result of the teaching approach at the school. After seeing the impact of the song on the inspectors, Krzysztof, moved by their praise, asked if he could give them a hug.  Therefore, they sang to the inspectors not only to showcase their musical talent but also to give the inspectors a taste of the school's unusual teaching method, to display the unique atmosphere of the school, emphasising how it creates an environment conducive to nurturing artistic talent while fostering respect and motivation within the students."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  What is an answer for this question: Which team lead a less safer experiment? A:","output":"Based on the given information and background, Team A led a less safer experiment.  When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, it explains how an increase in temperature leads to an increase in kinetic energy of the molecules within a closed system, like a sealed can of soup. In Team A's experiment, they heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first. As a result, the air molecules inside the can absorbed the heat, causing them to move faster and collide with the container walls, with more force and frequent impacts. This escalating pressure inside the can may eventually surpass its structural limits, leading to an explosion. In addition, the soup heating up could start boiling, generating even more gas and pressure within the can, making it more hazardous. On the contrary, Team B heated the can of soup over the fire but vented it first. This action allowed the pressure within the can to be safely released as the air molecules and steam from boiling expanded, significantly reducing the chances of an explosion. Therefore, Team A's unvented approach to heating the can of soup not only demonstrated a limited understanding of the kinetic-molecular theory but also created a potentially hazardous situation during the experiment. In contrast, Team B's vented approach demonstrated a safer practice and understanding of the principles involved in the kinetic-molecular theory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: lake, ocean, tetrahedron, mirror, object  Why is \\"lake\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Lake\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it adheres to the basic understanding of the real world and the relevant context in which boats are commonly found.  To delve deeper into why \\"lake\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense, let's consider each of the given possible answers: 1. Lake: A lake is a large body of water surrounded by land, and is a natural environment where boats are frequently used by humans for transportation, leisure, or fishing. Since the statement specifies \\"boats that aren't on the ocean,\\" it could be inferred that the question is referring to smaller bodies of water. Hence, a lake is a perfect answer, as it falls in line with human understanding of the geography and habitats where boats are commonly employed. 2. Ocean: The question explicitly mentions \\"boats that aren't on the ocean,\\" which eliminates \\"ocean\\" as an appropriate answer to the question as it goes against the stated condition. 3. Tetrahedron: A tetrahedron is a 3-dimensional geometric shape consisting of 4 triangular faces. It has no direct relation to the natural environment in which boats are found or used in human activity. Therefore, answering the question with \\"tetrahedron\\" is not aligned with human common sense, because it does not match the context of the question, and originates from an entirely different domain (geometry). 4. Mirror: A mirror is an object made of glass or another smooth, reflective surface that allows people to see reflections of themselves and other objects. It is not a natural environment where boats travel across, and therefore, answering \\"mirror\\" does not align with human common sense, since it does not fit within the context where boats may be found traveling. 5. Object: The term \\"object\\" is a very general term and could refer to any entity or thing, both physical and abstract. As a result, it is an ambiguous answer since \\"object\\" can encompass nearly anything. Human common sense favors specificity and context, making \\"lake\\" a better answer. In conclusion, the answer \\"lake\\" is aligned with human common sense as it appropriately fits within the context of natural environments where boats are commonly engaged in travel. Out of the given options, \\"lake\\" is the most relevant and relatable answer, making it the best choice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Ophthalmic Pearls      Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma      Download PDF      Primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL) has many names, including primary intraocular lymphoma or intraocular reticulum cell sarcoma, and it is a manifestation of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PVRL is a masquerade syndrome mimicking, for example, chronic uveitis; and its rarity, as well as the need for invasive diagnostic techniques, may delay diagnosis for up to 21 months after presentation.1 The poor systemic prognosis for this condition makes it essential to keep PVRL in the differential for chronic inflammatory conditions.      Epidemiology      PVRL is a rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The true incidence of intraocular lymphoma is unknown, but based on its co-occurrence in approximately 20% of patients with PCNSL, the estimated incidence is between 0.02 and 0.1/100,000 in the United States.2 While it has no race predilection, PVRL typically affects women in their fifth to sixth decade.      Association With CNS Lymphoma      PVRL often occurs concurrently with central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL); in fact, up to 90% of patients presenting with PVRL will develop CNSL within 29 months.3 Conversely, as many as 28% of patients with PCNSL have concurrent intraocular involvement.4 The most common form of PVRL is a diffuse large B-cell type that expresses specific ligands, leading to preferential homing to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from choroidal vasculature.      Clinical Presentation      The disease’s insidious onset coupled with vague complaints from patients with PVRL are among the factors that make early diagnosis difficult. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes other ocular lymphomas, non-lymphomatous neoplastic conditions, and non-neoplastic conditions of the retina (Table 1).      Symptoms. Nonetheless, a variety of clinical observations aid in diagnosis of PVRL. Typically, the disease mimics a steroid-resistant chronic uveitis with associated vitritis. The most common ocular complaints reported by patients include blurred vision, painless loss of vision, floaters, red eye, and photophobia. If PVRL presents concurrently with CNSL, there may be behavioral changes and neurological findings such as hemiparesis and ataxia.      Signs. On exam, clinical signs may overlap with those of chronic posterior uveitis. Anterior chamber signs may include mild cells and flare, but more typically, these signs are absent.      Vitritis is common in PVRL and may manifest as an “aurora borealis” effect as cells gather along vitreal fibers, especially in the superior peripheral vitreous.2 In addition, the vitreous cells in PVRL tend to be larger and less abundant than those found in typical vitritis. Although it is not common, the classic “leopard spot” collection of subretinal pigmented lesions that coalesce over time may appear on funduscopic examination.2 Retinal whitening, as seen in viral retinitis, is not a hallmark of this disease. Rarely, PVRL may be associated with exudative retinal detachment, a fundus mass, or concurrent optic nerve swelling.      Diagnosis      A patient who is 50 years or older with steroid-resistant uveitis or persistent vitritis, minimal fundus changes, and generally preserved visual acuity should raise suspicion for PVRL.      Imaging. Ophthalmic imaging studies, though not specific or diagnostic, may help validate clinical suspicion of the disease. Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography may exhibit localized hypofluorescent spots from subretinal infiltrate or hyperfluorescent window defects. Features present in other posterior uveitic conditions are not commonly seen, including perivascular staining, vessel leakage, cystoid macular edema, or optic nerve swelling.      Fundus autofluorescence patterns are typically normal but may highlight clinically observed areas of brown “leopard spots” as bright hyperautofluorescence. Chronic changes to the RPE may instead produce focal areas of dark hypoautofluoresence.      New findings that have been identified on optical coherence tomography include cellular infiltrates in the vitreous, focal pockets of subretinal hyper-reflective material between the RPE and Bruch’s membrane, and small pockets of RPE detachments.      Ophthalmic ultrasound is helpful to demonstrate choroidal thickening and rule out intraocular or orbital mass lesions as seen in choroidal lymphoma.      Laboratory testing. Once PVRL is considered in the differential diagnosis, more common causes of ocular inflammation should be eliminated, and directed systemic laboratory testing is usually needed. Definitive diagnosis requires identification of malignant lymphoid cells in the eye.      When vitritis is the predominant clinical sign, diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy to obtain both undiluted and partially diluted vitreous specimens is preferable to aqueous fluid collection or bedside vitreous tap. If multifocal white subretinal deposits are seen with minimal vitreous cells, a diagnostic vitrectomy may be combined with full-thickness chorioretinal biopsy or needle aspiration of subretinal material. Repeat biopsies may be required.      In all cases, specimens must be processed immediately and preferably hand-delivered by the operating surgeon to the laboratory for prompt analysis. After careful discussion with the pathologist, the surgeon should be certain that testing facilities are available for cytopathology.      Although cytopathology is most sensitive for detecting abnormal lymphoid cells, biomolecular analyses are available to bolster the diagnosis of B-cell PVRL, including detectable CD20, CD79, and PAX5. In rare cases, T-celldominated lymphoma may reveal CD3 and CD8 markers. Flow cytometric analysis may identify clonal B-cell populations on the basis of cell surface markers. Further tests include immunohistochemistry and elevated IL-10 to IL-6 ratio greater than 1, but clinicians should be aware of the low sensitivity of this method of testing.      If the diagnosis is confirmed, a team approach with a medical oncologist trained in treatment of CNS lymphoma is recommended to help coordinate systemic testing, including neuroimaging and lumbar puncture.      Treatment and Prognosis      Management of PVRL remains controversial, but it generally employs a multimodal approach including systemic therapy, radiotherapy, and intravitreal chemotherapy monitored by an oncologist. Systemic high-dose methotrexate (MTX)-based chemotherapy is used to treat both ocular and CNS disease. Many clinicians favor systemic therapy even for apparently isolated ocular disease, out of concern that subclinical CNS disease may be present concurrently.      Local ocular therapy may be used as monotherapy or as part of a combination that includes external beam radiotherapy to both globes and intravitreal MTX and rituximab.5 The involvement of both eyes does not preclude the use of local therapy, but systemic therapy should be considered.      Prognosis. Relapse rates for PVRL are variable depending on treatment and follow-up. Despite advances in treatment and diagnosis, prognosis for those with PVRL/PCNSL remains dismal, with progression-free survival around 1 year and overall survival under 3 years. Although ocular therapy alone can achieve local control, it has little effect on overall survival.      Key Points      PVRL remains an elusive diagnosis, with vague signs and symptoms and difficult diagnostic confirmation. Appropriate suspicion of chronic, treatment-resistant uveitis can aid in earlier detection. Definitive diagnosis still requires the identification of lymphoma cells within the vitreous or retina. Although the prognosis is poor, newer treatment modalities have increased survival while helping limit visual and neurologic side effects.      ___________________________      1 Whitcup SM et al.

The cancer, called vitreoretinal lymphoma, had been diagnosed in the U.S. only a handful of times over the previous 20 years.      The doctors tried to figure out what might have caused this rare cancer in these 10 patients, all of whom were diagnosed between 2010 and 2013, and they discovered that six of the patients had an interesting connection: They all had lived near the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.      The Chernobyl disaster is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history: On April 26, 1986, an explosion occurred at the plant in Ukraine, leaking massive amounts of cancer-causing radiation into the atmosphere. [Cancer-Fighting Diet: 6 Tips to Reduce Your Risk]      Vitreoretinal lymphoma is a type of eye cancer that affects white blood cells in the retina, the optic nerve or the vitreous humor (the gel-like substance found inside the eye), said Roxana Moslehi, a genetic epidemiologist at the University at Albany, State University of New York, and the senior author of the study on the New York cases. The doctors who diagnosed the cancers had reached out to Moslehi when they realized they were seeing something strange happening with the rates of this cancer, she said.      Moslehi set out to determine if the cases of vitreoretinal cancer represented a \\"cluster\\" — in other words, a group of cases that are close together in time and location and occur at higher rates than expected. She presented her findings here today (April 2) at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting. The findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.      Based on data from the New York State Cancer Registry, Moslehi found that statistically, there should be only one case of vitreoretinal lymphoma in New York state in a four-year period. So to find 10 cases in New York City alone in that same time period was certainly \\"unanticipated,\\" and represented a cluster, she said. Moslehi also looked at national rates of the disease, and also found incredibly low rates.      To figure out what could be causing this cluster, the researchers looked for commonalities among the patients, Moslehi said. They noted that eight of the 10 were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, she said.      But even more interesting to the researchers was that six of the 10 patients had lived near Chernobyl at the time of the disaster, Moslehi said. Four of the patients had lived in Ukraine, one patient had lived in Poland and one patient had lived in Moldova, according to the case report.      \\"It was very surprising to discover this,\\" Moslehi told Live Science. The cause of vitreoretinal lymphoma is unknown, \\"so any clues that you get as to possible causes make you very excited,\\" she said. [10 Do's and Don'ts to Reduce Your Risk of Cancer]      Indeed, in looking through the literature, the researchers found several studies linking other types of lymphoma to exposure to radiation, Moslehi said. For example, clean-up workers at Chernobyl have been shown to have higher rates of a type of cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukemia, she said. In addition, rates of leukemia in children and adults are increased in people who were exposed to either Chernobyl or the atomic bombs that the U.S. dropped on Japan during World War II, she said. (Both leukemia and lymphoma affect white blood cells.)      The New York City patients who had lived near Chernobyl ranged in age from 62 to 85 at the time of their diagnosis, according to the case report. The diagnoses took place between 24 and 27 years after the nuclear disaster, meaning that a number of the patients were in their late 30s when the disaster took place. Moslehi is still looking at the cases in the other four patients, who did not live near Chernobyl, for clues in those cases, she said.      There was also another cluster of cases that involved related conditions, called myeloproliferative disorders, that was found in Israel, Moslehi said. Myeloproliferative disorders cause blood cells proliferative abnormally. Similar to the group in New York City, the patients in Israel were of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity and lived near Chernobyl at the time of the disaster.      Moslehi noted that they \\"still cannot link this disease or lymphoma to radiation per se\\" — more studies are needed to fully understand the cause. For example, it may be that Ashkenazi Jews are more susceptible to the effects of radiation, she said.      Editor's note: This story was corrected from the original version. The Israeli cluster had myeloproliferative disorders, not vitreoretinal lymphoma.      Originally published on Live Science. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma (PVRL) is a rare eye disease that affects white blood cells in the retina, the optic nerve, or the gel-like substance in the eye called the vitreous humor. It's a type of cancer that can be difficult to detect because it has vague signs and symptoms. PVRL is important to watch out for when somebody has chronic, treatment-resistant uveitis. Detecting this disease early can lead to better treatment and a higher chance of survival, but finding it often requires looking closely at the cells in the eye.  Some studies suggest that PVRL can be linked to exposure to radiation, like the kind from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster. This connection was found when doctors discovered ten people in New York City with the rare disease, and six of them had lived close to Chernobyl during the time of the explosion. More research is needed to fully understand this connection and other factors that may influence PVRL."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: The population of what had increased by 40% in 1901? , can you please find it?   The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared.

From the end of Prohibition through the 1960s, New York's Stork Club was the epicenter of celebrity society. The night club in Midtown was founded by ex-bootlegger Sherman Billingsley, who kept his famous customers happy with good service - communicating to his wait staff through a secret language of hand signals that ranged from 'No need to pay attention to these folks' to 'Bring a bottle of champagne'. Billingsley revealed his secret code in 1944, and LIFE recently republished the set of the pictures. Perhaps the most surprising hand signal is a simple thumbs up, which meant 'Get them out and don't let them in again'. Secret language: LIFE recently republished Stork Club owner Sherman Billingsley's secret hand signal codes that he used in the legendary New York club. A thumbs up was not a good signal for a customer receive. It meant 'Get them out and don't let them in again' That's a hand signal Milton Berle, Elliott Roosevelt, Humphrey Bogart and Jackie Gleason probably all saw when they visited the legendary club, as all four were eventually banned. But most of the secret signals were good signs, and usually meant a treat for whatever customer Billingsley was chatting up that night. If he adjusted his tie, it meant the table wouldn't be seeing a check - Billingsley was footing the bill. When he grabbed his pocket square, a server somewhere was sent to fetch a 200 bottle of perfume as a gift. 'The music in the main dining room is too loud': Some of Billingsley's hand signals were purely for the servers and not comments about the people he was talking to. Spoiler: Billingsgley often showered his customers with gifts from free rounds of drinks (hand signal left) to 200 bottles of perfume (hand signal right) And more gifts: When he adjusted his tie, it meant he was paying the tables check. And a laid out hand on the table it meant to bring a complimentary bottle of champagne. Billingsley was notorious for his generosity, and customers often left with anything from a gold compact to cigar clippers. Other than getting the boot, the only bad hand signals were the ones labeling customers as bores. When he scratched his nose it meant the table he was talking to had no important people at it. And if he made a cuffing hand over his ear, he wanted a server to pretend he had a call so he could leave. Bores: Scratching his nose meant the table he was talking to wasn't important (left) and cuffing his hand to his ear meant someone needed to pretend he had a call so he could politely excuse himself from the table (right) But with clientele like Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, and Ernest Hemingway, it's hard to imagine Billingsley used those hand signals very often. The Stork Club was torn down in 1965, and today a park sits in its place. But Billingsley's secret language of hand signals lived on even after his club's death and continues to be used in fine-dining restaurants across the nation. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about a club in New York called the Stork Club that was very famous a long time ago. The man who started the club, Sherman Billingsley, used secret hand signals to talk to his workers without other people knowing. Some signals meant to give gifts to customers or take care of their bills, while others meant a customer was not important or needed to be asked to leave. Many famous people went to this club and sometimes received special treatment. The club was eventually torn down, but the special hand signals are still used in fancy restaurants today."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: Booking Ms. Keys and Mr. Legend appeared almost perverse from a distance — the comedian Hannibal Burress, in an interlude, suggested the festival was arranged by a shuffle feature. The two edgeless singers were about a decade older than most of the rappers on the schedule. And yet it worked as a balm. Ms. Keys was intermittently strong, her voice excellent on older hits and too good for her dimmer newer material. Mr. Legend, typically unctuous, was immaculate here, exuding confident calm behind his piano in front of a crowd that had just been shrieking for Mr. West. The last song Mr. West performed, after a quick medley of old and new hits, was “Ultralight Beam,” his collaboration with Chance from his most recent album, “The Life of Pablo.” It was an affecting moment — elder and younger coming together in praise — and the highlight of the whole day. Chance seemed unburdened, able to marvel at what he’d pulled off. At night, Chance performed his headlining set, which initially appeared to be weighing more heavily upon him. After a couple of exuberant songs — “I got my city doing front flips,” he rapped on “Angels” — he said to the crowd, “It doesn’t feel real yet.” He played a muted song from his first mixtape, then walked offstage. When he returned a couple of minutes later — perhaps he was rearranging the set list? — he appeared to be torn between the urge to uplift the whole stadium, or to noodle along to his own instincts. Complicating matters, he introduced a life-size Muppet-like puppet, Carlos the Lion, who served as a sort of elder antagonist figure, constantly prodding Chance to remain on message. The exchange was, at times, mystifying, structurally loose and distracting — an id and superego having a conversation over a fuzzy phone connection. When he was joined by a second puppet for a duet of the sweetly melancholic “Same Drugs,” it cohered slightly more, but still approximated puppet theater. After around 15 minutes of this, Chance switched modes, shifting to reliably high-energy songs from “Coloring Book,” his recent album, including “No Problems” “Mixtape” and “All We Got.” His unbridled joy here was a rejoinder to his earlier bewilderment — the internal tug-of-war was tactile. What settled the debate was faith. No rapper more effectively renders praise music than Chance. “I speak to God in public/He keep my rhymes in couplets,” he raps on “Blessings (Reprise).” When midway through his set, silence between songs was cut through by a choir — yes, a puppet choir — singing “How Great,” the mood changed from plain old celebration to worship. The songs that followed — “Finish Line/Drown,” “Blessings (Reprise)” (backed by the Chicago Children’s Choir) — were trembling with energy. Whatever back and forth Chance had been experiencing earlier in the night had evaporated. Maybe because he realized that what happened in this stadium, while important, wasn’t the goal. “Did you know that your blessing is not at this show?” he told the crowd, then assured them, “But it’s coming. Did you know that your blessing is not made of flesh? But it’s coming.” WHAT IT IS A taut cross-genre festival that was Chance the Rapper’s love letter to Chicago’s South Side, and also a display of his influence in this city. ATTENDANCE Nearly 48,000 people, a number that Chance said broke the record for White Sox stadium events. NUMBER OF PERFORMERS A heavy-hitting lineup with just nine acts. LANDSCAPE A baseball stadium in the Armour Square section, south of Chicago’s downtown. TYPICAL FESTIVALGOER Young, ecstatic and diverse. At least a couple of dozen were sporting the overalls favored by Chance, and thousands more wore commemorative T-shirts, sweatshirts and caps bought that day. Not long after Tyler, the Creator finished his set, the lazy opening figure of Kanye West’s “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” began booming through the stadium speakers. Fans were streaming off the field to go grab food, buy merchandise, use the bathroom. “He’s not coming,” one said to his friend, who looked crestfallen. Then, a roar from the field — there was Mr. West, clad in all black, rapping in the early fall sun. Cue mayhem — thousands of fans surged toward the field, overwhelming ushers and guards meant to keep them in their section. On the left side of the stage, a row of porta-potties became a makeshift staircase supporting scores of young people who hopped the guard rail, landed atop the stalls, then slid their way down to the field. At first, security guards stood by, helpless. Then they began helping, offering outstretched hands to steady fans as they fell to the ground. In addition to the stadium’s usual food options of polish sausages, chicken tenders and churros, there were tables for Harold’s Chicken Shack and Haire’s Gulf Shrimp, two staples of Chicago’s South Side. An earlier version of this article misidentified the point in the concert when people could first see Chance the Rapper. It was when he came on stage during an opening act’s set, not when he appeared on a video screen later watching Kanye West perform.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the real name of the person who is being sent to an all-girl sleepaway camp?  Set in the 1950s, the film begins in medias res near the end of the story, with a confrontation between two men: one of them, Clare Quilty, drunk and incoherent, plays Chopin's Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1 on the piano before being shot from behind a portrait painting of a young woman. The shooter is Humbert Humbert, a 40-something British professor of French literature. The film then flashes back to events four years earlier. Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \\"Lolita\\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated. To be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. But Charlotte wants all of \\"Hum's\\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte. Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and brassy Charlotte more whiny. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing her as \\"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless baba\\".

To further elaborate on this: 1. \\"Fold the tip in triangle\\" refers to folding the tip of the garment or cloth into a triangular shape. To do this, ensure you are holding the tip and carefully make a fold so the tip aligns with the edge of the garment, forming a triangle. 2. \\"Towards front of pants\\" suggests that the triangular fold should be done such that it faces the front part of the pants. Make sure that the triangle's base is aligned with the waistband of the pants and the tip of the triangle is pointing downward towards the front side. 3. \\"And fasten neatly mid front\\" indicates that the folded triangle should be securely fastened in the middle front part of the pants. To achieve this neatly, you might need to use a safety pin, button, or another type of fastener, depending on the garment's design.

To what plant did botanist Leonard Fuchs give his name","output":"Botanist Leonard Fuchs gave his name to the plant genus Fuchsia, a group of flowering plants belonging to the family Onagraceae. Leonard Fuchs (1501-1566) was a German physician and prominent botanist of the 16th century, and is best known for his contributions to the classification, identification, and description of plants. Born in Bavaria, Leonard Fuchs studied at Ingolstadt and earned his medical doctorate from the University of Tübingen in 1524. Fuchs was a prolific author, publishing several influential books on medicine, pharmacology, and botany. His most widely-known work, \\"De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes\\" (Notable Commentaries on the History of Plants), was published in 1542. This seminal work presented detailed descriptions and images of many new and previously known plants, providing valuable knowledge to botanists, herbalists, and physicians during the Renaissance. Fuchs sought to standardize plant names and descriptions and is considered one of the founding fathers of modern botany. In 1753, the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus identified a new genus of flowering plants and named it Fuchsia in honor of Leonard Fuchs. Linnaeus recognized the valuable contributions of Fuchs to the field of botany and decided to pay homage to him in this manner. Fuchsia comprises over 100 species, predominantly native to Central and South America. They consist of shrubs, small trees, and herbaceous plants known for their striking, pendulous flowers. Often displayed as a beautiful splash of color, Fuchsia flowers consist of vivid hues such as pink, red, purple, and white. The distinctive downward-facing blooms make Fuchsia plants attractive to pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Beyond their ornamental value, some Fuchsia species have been used for their medicinal properties by indigenous peoples of Central and South America. They have been employed to treat ailments such as infections, inflammation, and digestive issues. In conclusion, Leonard Fuchs, an influential German botanist, lent his name to the Fuchsia plant genus due to his remarkable work in botany during the 16th century. Fuchsia plants are admired for their vibrant and unique flowers and hold a special place in the field of botanical history as a tribute to Fuchs and his impact on the development of modern botany."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Which gender typically experiences growth spurts first?   A: The answer is:","output":"Females typically experience growth spurts first. Growth spurts refer to the rapid increase in height and weight that occurs during puberty. For both genders, this process is triggered by the release of hormones, including growth hormone, estrogen, and testosterone. In general, females tend to enter puberty earlier than males, with growth spurts occurring around age 9-13 for girls, while boys experience growth spurts later, around age 11-16. Girls usually experience a rapid increase in height first, followed by a growth spurt in weight. Boys, on the other hand, often experience an increase in weight before their height shoots up. It's essential to note that these are average age ranges, and the actual onset of puberty and growth spurts can vary significantly from person to person, depending on genetics, nutrition, and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be?","output":"A geoscientist is a scientist who studies the Earth, its various processes, and its components. Geoscientists use their knowledge about geological phenomena to analyze, predict, and uncover information about the Earth's structure, composition, and history, as well as to find and manage natural resources such as minerals, water, and energy sources. The field of geoscience encompasses a broad range of disciplines, including geology, geophysics, geochemistry, geomorphology, and more. Many geoscientists also work in interdisciplinary fields, combining their research with other sciences like biology, chemistry, and physics. Geoscientists conduct research, gather and analyze data, and interpret the findings to better understand the Earth and its systems. They utilize various tools and techniques, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing, to map, visualize, and study geological structures and features. Geoscientists often work in outdoor settings, examining rocks, minerals, and fossils in their natural environment. They are responsible for determining the hazards and environmental impacts of natural processes and human activities on the Earth and providing recommendations to policymakers and industry leaders. There are several subspecialties within geoscience, including: 1. Geology: Geologists study the physical aspects and history of the Earth, such as rock formations, mineral composition, and fossil records. They are often involved in natural resource exploration and development, hazard assessment (e.g., earthquakes, landslides), and environmental projects. 2. Geophysics: Geophysicists explore the Earth's interior through indirect methods, such as analyzing the effects of seismic waves, gravity, and magnetism. They work in areas such as mineral and oil exploration, environmental assessments, and earthquake prediction. 3. Geochemistry: Geochemists investigate the chemical composition of rocks, minerals, and other Earth materials to understand geological processes, age determination, and environmental impacts. They often work in resource assessment, pollution monitoring, and climate change research. 4. Geomorphology: Geomorphologists study the Earth's surface features and the processes that produce and modify them. Their work addresses issues such as erosion, sedimentation, and landscape evolution, often in the context of environmental management and hazard mitigation. 5. Hydrogeology: Hydrogeologists study the distribution, movement, and quality of groundwater resources. They are involved in projects concerning water supply, contamination, and remediation, as well as groundwater management and protection. 6. Paleontology: Paleontologists study the fossil record to understand the evolution of life on Earth and the processes that have shaped our planet's ecosystems. Their work has applications in resource exploration, education, and environmental management. 7. Seismology: Seismologists study earthquakes, their causes, and their effects on the Earth's structure. They are involved in predicting and analyzing seismic events to minimize the potential impacts on human populations and infrastructure. 8. Remote Sensing and GIS: These geoscientists use satellite and aerial imagery, as well as other geospatial data, to map and study the Earth and its features. They are involved in land-use planning, resource management, and environmental monitoring. Geoscientists play a critical role in understanding the Earth's processes, resources, and hazards, and their work has significant implications for a wide range of industries and sectors. They contribute valuable insights to our knowledge of the planet we live on, and their expertise is increasingly essential in the face of growing global challenges such as resource scarcity, climate change, and natural disasters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first... contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the school Sir Alexander Mackenzie was principal of?, what is it ?

What is the answer??","output":"In order to solve the equation 12613 = -1427*v + 69693 for v, we should start by isolating the variable on one side of the equation. Here are the steps: 1. First, let's move 69693 from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, we should subtract 69693 from both sides of the equation. It gives us:         12613 - 69693 = -1427*v  (This is done in accordance with the mathematical property that states what you do to one side of an equation, you must do the same thing to the other side of the equation.)    Simplifying this, we get: -57080 = -1427*v 2. Now, let's isolate v by dividing both sides of the equation by -1427. This is done because on the right side -1427 multiplies v, and the inverse operation of multiplication is division.     So, (-57080 / -1427) = v  (This is done according to the same mathematical property used in Step 1.) 3. Applying the operation, we find: v ≈ 40.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There are some very good inventions which, for one reason or another, don't become popular. These inventions should be better known, even though I think that some of them are crazy. Let's have a look at some of these inventions and see if you agree that they should be more successful. The Australians had a great idea to stop people from drinking and driving. The idea was that if a driver wanted to start the car, she or he would have to blow into a bag first. If there was too much alcohol   in their breath, the car wouldn't start. It sounded like a great idea to me, but people said that they might need to drive the car in an emergency   even if they had drunk too much alcohol. Another idea I liked was an invention by a scientist who thought his children watched too much TV. He connected the TV to an exercise bike so that the electricity to power the TV was produced by the bike. If the children wanted to watch a lot of TV, they had to pedal   very hard. I found another invention on the Internet which encouraged good habits. Believe it or not, this invention was an ashtray   which spoke to you when you lit a cigarette! The \\"voice\\" of the ashtray was started by the heat from the cigarette and reminded you how dangerous it is to smoke. One of the strangest inventions I have come across is a bicycle which can cross rivers! The idea was that when you came to a river, you could _ a huge plastic ball all around the bike. You would then get into the ball which would float on the river while you pedaled the bike inside the ball! Why not use a bridge instead? A friend of mine at school once bought a strange pair of football shoes. On the bottom of the shoes there was a rotating pad of studs  . The idea was that you would change direction more quickly if the studs rotated with you. The problem was that every time you stopped you changed direction whether you wanted to or not! I think he wore those shoes twice! One thing I would like is a baseball cap with a built-in radio so you can listen to sport all day with your hands...

Kara (Hangul: kara, Japanese: kara, often stylized as KARA) was a South Korean pop girl group formed by DSP Media in 2007. The group's final lineup was composed of Park Gyuri, Han Seungyeon, Goo Hara and Heo Youngji. Members Nicole Jung and Kang Ji-young officially departed from the group in 2014, while Kim Sung-hee left in 2008. The group's name comes from the Greek word \\"chara\\" (khara, lit. \\"joy\\"), which they interpreted to mean \\"sweet melody\\". The group was scheduled to have their comeback in March 2008 with their second album, however, member Kim Sung-hee suddenly announced that she would be leaving the group due to parental pressure because her participation in the group was contingent on the maintenance of her grades. In response, DSP stated that the second album that was recorded would be shelved and replaced by a mini-album to come in May; in addition, two members would join the group. Auditions were held, and the two new members were eventually revealed to be Goo Ha-ra and Kang Jiyoung. The group made their return in the music industry as a quintet on July 24, 2008 with \\"Rock U\\" on M! Countdown. They made their comeback with the \\"cute\\" and \\"playful\\" image which was the complete opposite of the group's original image from their debut. In the same month, their first mini-album titled Rock U was also released. The second season of Kara Self Camera was premiered on August 18, 2008, which chronicled how the group was adapting to their two new members.  On November 29, 2008, DSP released a teaser video for their upcoming single, \\"Pretty Girl\\", which received over 40,000 hits within 12 hours. The full video was released on December 2, 2008 online and was positively received by the public. The EP, Pretty Girl, was released on December 4, embodying a \\"fun-party\\" concept. The group began its comeback on all major music shows on December 4, 2008, starting with M! Countdown. During their first national performance on KBS's Music Bank, member Goo Hara accidentally gasped \\"ah!\\" live on air due to slipping on falling confetti, and reportedly cried profusely afterwards. The incident became a hot issue to many viewers, but Goo Hara received comfort instead of criticism from the general public.  Park Gyuri attributed their popularity increase to their \\"pretty but natural\\" appeal, while media reports gave credit to the band for finally finding its own identity in the music industry since the group's debut and to older male fans, most notably singer Shin Hae Chul. Due to their increasingly hectic schedule as their popularity rose, a few of the group's members were taken to the hospital on December 19 after a Music Bank rehearsal for cold symptoms and exhaustion.","output":"This text is about a South Korean pop girl group called Kara.

It will be part of a project to create a major visitor attraction in the city using virtual reality to tell the story of James I and the Stewart monarchs. James I was assassinated in Perth in 1437 and later buried at the Charterhouse monastery. But the priory was destroyed in the reformation 100 years later and no-one is sure of the grave's exact location. The monastery where he was buried was built on his orders and was part of his great plans for Perth. Historians believe he wanted to create a complex on the scale of Westminster and move St Andrews University to the city to compete with Oxford. Dr Lucy Dean, from the University of the Highlands and Islands, told BBC Scotland: \\"Thirteen out of 18 of James' parliaments take place in Perth. He is centralising his government here. \\"I'm not sure whether Perth would have been the capital but it was definitely in the running for being the capital. [His] murder halted that idea in its tracks.\\" James I was assassinated on 4 February 1437 while he was in the royal apartments at the Blackfriars monastery in Perth. After a group of 30 conspirators were let into the building he tried to hide in a sewer, but he was trapped and killed by Sir Robert Graham. A pub and sheltered housing accommodation now stands on the site of his death. The area where he died is marked with a stone monument. Archaeologist David Bowler, who explored the site in the 1980s, said he was \\"very excited\\" by the plans to find the king's tomb. \\"It's something we've all been thinking about in Perth for many, many years,\\" he said. \\"We've all known about the Carthusian friary and we want to know a bit more about where it is.\\" Leaders of this project, which also includes a \\"virtual museum\\" depicting Medieval Perth, hope the city could benefit from the discovery of the tomb in the same way Leicester did when Richard III's remains were found. Richard Oram, professor of Medieval history at the University of Stirling, said: \\"If we were to actually locate where the royal tomb was within this complex - we saw what that did to Leicester with the rediscovery of Richard III. \\"A lot more people know Richard III than James I but we're looking to try and change that.

The birthplace of pizza is largely credited to Naples, a city in Southern Italy, during the late 18th to early 19th century. The humble beginnings of this universally loved food can be traced back to a time when Neapolitan flatbread was sold as street food to the poor Neapolitans. The dish was intended to be a quick and affordable snack that can be consumed on the go, and the early versions of the cuisine were often basic and didn't even include cheese or tomatoes, ingredients we now commonly associate with pizza. The specific style of pizza that we're most familiar with, that combines tomatoes, cheese, and other toppings on a thick or thin crust, also originates from Naples. The story goes that in 1889, to honor the visit of Queen Margherita of Italy, Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito created a pizza resembling the colors of the Italian flag, with red tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese, and green basil. This pizza, named ‘Pizza Margherita’ after the Queen, gained immense popularity and set the standard for what we now know as pizza. However, the pizza that is popular in New York and much of the United States has its own unique development and character. When waves of Italian immigrants, many from Naples, began arriving in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century, they brought their culinary traditions with them, including pizza.  The first pizzeria in the U.S., Gennaro Lombardi’s, opened in Manhattan in 1905. It was here that the New York style pizza was born. The advent of coal-fired brick ovens changed the way pizza was made, giving it a unique flavor and crust that differentiated it from its Neapolitan ancestor. The New York style pizza is characterized by its large, hand-tossed thin crust, heavy on the sauce and cheese, which is often sold in wide slices to go. So, in conclusion, while the invention of pizza in its earliest form belongs to Naples, Italy, New York has played a significant role in popularizing and further developing the dish into the beloved pizza we know of today. Both regions deserve recognition for their unique contributions to the evolution of pizza."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1971, publishing executives at McGraw-Hill express an interest in Clifford Irving's novel, Rudnick's Problem. Fake!, his previous book about art forger Elmyr de Hory, had sold poorly. Irving believes he has a breakout work, but the publisher decides against releasing the book after a Life editor deems it unsatisfactory. Vacationing with his friend and researcher Richard Suskind, Irving is ejected from his hotel at 1 a.m, after eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes arrives and demands the entire building be vacated. Returning to New York City to meet with his publishers, Irving finds he has been reduced to meeting with an assistant. Irving storms into the board room, says his new project will be the \\"book of the century\\", and threatens to take it elsewhere. He struggles to come up with a topic fit for his grandiose claim. Seeing a cover story on Hughes, he decides to make him the subject. Irving tells McGraw-Hill that Hughes has recruited him to help write his autobiography, and shows forged handwritten notes from Hughes as proof. Handwriting experts confirm the notes as genuine, and the publishers strike a 500,000 deal for the book. Irving believes that the reclusive Hughes is unlikely to sue him, and that his eccentricities can be used to deflect any denials of authenticity for the book. At the time Irving is having marital problems with his artist wife Edith; he has had an affair. Irving assures Edith he'll be faithful as he leaves to begin research with Suskind. To fool experts, the two men devote days to studying documents pertaining to Hughes. They illicitly obtain a copy of a draft biography of Noah Dietrich, a retired Hughes aide, which provides details that add to the apparent authenticity of their work. Irving recites passages into a tape recorder while in character as Hughes, dressing like the millionaire and adding a mustache during these sessions. As work on the book progresses, Irving receives a box containing scandalous material about questionable dealings between Hughes and President Richard...

Answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who is accidentally killed trying to escape authorities?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Carl Schaffner is a crooked British (previously German) businessman who flees to Mexico after stealing company funds. While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police.  The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog. The local police chief and Scotland Yard inspector Hadden conspire to keep him trapped in the Mexican border town of Katrina in an effort to get him to cross the bridge back into the U.S. and face justice. The misanthropic Schaffner has grown attached to Scarff's pet spaniel and is tricked into going across the dividing line of the bridge to get the dog.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Circular eyes seem to make the most sense being placed evenly apart from each other, as opposed to side-by-side.  How high or low the eyes sit on the face could help convey an emotion, so take that into consideration as you begin to draw. You will also need to decide how big you want the eyes to be. How much space of the face they take up determines what other features you can add to it. Circles are a great shape for cartoon eyes because humans do not have circular eyes.  Use your compass to make these circles. Be sure to adjust the angle of your compass in order to make smaller circles. Make the circles large enough to leave room for pupils inside. Remember that you may need to hold both legs of the compass to avoid your angle widening as you draw the circles. Circular eyes are great for conveying a few different emotions, and the placement and size of the pupils lend showing to these emotions.  Surprise Fear Shock Worry Delight Keep in mind the emotion that you are trying to convey with your cartoon character's eyes.  The thickness of the iris helps your audience better understand how your cartoon character feels. The color that you choose for the iris can also help to convey an emotion. Or, the color can simply demonstrate your unique creativity and the embodiment of what you envision your cartoon to look like. It is up to you how you shade in these characteristics, as it will depend on whether your character is male or female.  You might want to simply thicken the top line of the eye, with tapers at either end, to indicate eyelashes without drawing wispy lashes. Alternatively, you might want to add a number of eyelashes. Fewer numbers of eyelashes, or even no eyelashes, are common with circular cartoon eyes.  Remember to draw your eyebrows in a shape that helps convey your character's emotion, as well as to indicate male or female. High arching eyebrows indicate surprise or fright, while lower, less arched eyebrows might indicate boredom or sadness.","output":"The article provides guidance on how to draw circular cartoon eyes, discussing their placement and size, the importance of conveying emotions through eye position and characteristics, the usage of a compass for drawing circles, the role of the iris and color choices, incorporating eyelashes, and drawing eyebrows that convey emotions and gender for a cartoon character."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise clearly states that \\"DiClemente noted that some trials have found patients with more severe problems being helped.\\" This directly contradicts the hypothesis by presenting evidence where patients with more severe problems did receive help in some trials, according to DiClemente.  The premise suggests that, according to DiClemente, there are clinical trials or studies that have demonstrated positive outcomes or benefits for patients with more severe problems. This could mean that the interventions or treatments employed in these trials were effective in addressing or improving the issues faced by these patients, or at least providing them with some form of assistance, even if the results may not be across-the-board improvements. In contrast, the hypothesis posits that DiClemente pointed out that there were no trials where patients with more severe problems were helped. If this were true, it would imply that there is a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of specific interventions or treatments for this patient population, which could be a matter of concern for clinicians, researchers, and policy-makers alike. It could also signify that there may be challenges or barriers to providing effective care or support to this group, necessitating further investigation and improvement in research and practice.

The CA1 neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate. This high level of extracellular glutamate allow calcium to enter NMDA receptors which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind. This directly relates to traumatic events in one's past such as kidnappings, being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child. What protons are damaged during stressful events? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Okay, imagine your brain is like a big playground where lots of little friends called \\"neurons\\" live. These little friends help you remember things. Sometimes, when you feel worried or scared, your body makes something called \\"glucocorticoids.\\" These can be bad for your little friends in a place called the \\"hippocampus\\" in your brain. When there's just too much of these glucocorticoids, it can make it hard for your little friends to get the things they need, like food (glucose) and to clean up the playground (remove glutamate). This causes some of your little friends, called \\"CA1 neurons,\\" to get hurt. When they get hurt, it can make it harder for you to remember things as you get older. Sometimes, when something really bad or scary happens, your brain might hide that memory away in a secret place so you don't have to think about it. But the question about protons being damaged during stressful events is not something we can answer. Protons are really tiny parts of atoms, and they don't usually get damaged during stressful events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned suggests a situation where an increasing number of vineyards surrounds the pancake making process. To evaluate the possible effects of this scenario on the process of making pancakes, let us first consider the components and steps involved in making pancakes and then analyze the potential influence of vineyards. Making pancakes involves several major steps and ingredients. The key ingredients are flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, milk, eggs, and melted butter. The primary steps in the process include mixing the dry ingredients, incorporating the wet ingredients, and cooking the batter on a heated griddle or frying pan.  When examining the influence of vineyards on the pancake making process, it is important to consider the role of vineyards and their associated activities. Vineyards are primarily dedicated to the cultivation of grapes for winemaking purposes. The production process for wine predominantly involves growing and harvesting grapes, followed by fermentation, aging, and bottling.  Given this understanding of vineyards and the pancake making process, it seems unlikely that there would be a direct impact from the presence of more vineyards on the process of making pancakes. The core ingredients and steps involved in preparing pancakes are not significantly influenced by grape cultivation or the activities carried out in a vineyard. However, it is possible that certain indirect influences may be identified. For instance: 1. Economic factors: The growth of the local economy due to the presence of more vineyards might lead to an increase in the demand for food items, such as pancakes, at local eateries or related businesses. In turn, this could lead to a higher volume of pancake production in the region. 2. Tourism: With more vineyards in the area, there might be an increase in tourism, which could drive demand for local foods, including pancakes. Additionally, vineyards might decide to diversify their offerings by including a breakfast service that features pancakes. 3. Agricultural impact: Though the ingredients for pancakes are not directly derived from vineyards, it is possible that the increasing presence of vineyards could influence the local availability or costs of specific ingredients used for pancakes such as milk or eggs, if vineyards were to replace dairy farms or poultry farms in the area. 4. Environmental factors: The addition of more vineyards could lead to changes in the local climate or ecosystems, which might indirectly affect the quality or availability of the ingredients for pancakes. For example, the water used for irrigating vineyards might impact the quality of the grains that are used to make flour for pancakes. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of an increased number of vineyards would not directly affect the process of making pancakes. However, there could be indirect effects on the demand and availability of pancakes within the surrounding region, influenced by factors such as economic growth, tourism, local agriculture, and environmental changes. These potential influences should be considered in a broader context when evaluating the impact of vineyards on the pancake-making process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The War on Kids Movie plot: Blame for problems with schooling in America is often assigned to insufficient funding or the inherent failings of today's kids. In rare cases, parents, teachers, and administrators are also implicated. However, all efforts to improve the quality of education are doomed to fail if the system itself is not examined and understood to be the most significant impediment. After over six years in the making, THE WAR ON KIDS reveals that the problems with public education ultimately stem from the institution itself. Astonishingly all efforts at reform consistently avoid even considering this to be a possibility and the future for children and American democracy are at stake.In 95 minutes, THE WAR ON KIDS exposes the many ways the public school system has failed children and our future by robbing students of all freedoms due largely to irrational fears. Children are subjected to endure prison-like security, arbitrary punishments, and pharmacological abuse through the forced prescription of dangerous drugs. Even with these measures, schools not only fail to educate students, but the drive to teach has become secondary to the need to control children.THE WAR ON KIDS begins with the history of Zero Tolerance policy. In the 1990s, almost all schools began instituting guidelines that were originally designed to keep weapons and drugs off campus. Very quickly, school officials began to arbitrarily decide what should be considered a weapon and what should be considered a drug. Hundreds of situations followed where children were (and continue to be) suspended or expelled for possessing food knives, nail clippers, key chains, chicken strips, aspirin, and candy. Kindergarteners were even suspended for playing cops and robbers and using their fingers as guns. Under the guise of Zero Tolerance, administrators have been able to wield tremendous power without the burden of responsibility and this authority continues to be increasingly abused.

Comet strikes may have jump-started life on Earth An image of Halley's Comet taken in 1986. Life's building blocks can form in the harsh environment of deep space, a new study suggests, bolstering the odds that a comet or meteorite strike may have jump-started biological evolution on Earth. Linked pairs of amino acids called dipeptides can take shape in spacelike conditions, a team of chemists found. Dipeptides brought to Earth aboard a comet or meteorite billions of years ago may have then catalyzed the formation of even more complex molecules necessary for life as we know it, such as proteins and sugars, researchers said. \\"It is fascinating to consider that the most basic biochemical building blocks that led to life on Earth may well have had an extraterrestrial origin,\\" study co-author Richard Mathies, of the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement. The chemists created a mock mini-comet in the lab, chilling a mixture of carbon dioxide, ammonia and various hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane down to 10 degrees above absolute zero (minus 442 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 263 degrees Celsius) in a vacuum chamber. They then zapped the mixture with high-energy electrons, simulating the effect of impacts by cosmic rays — fast-moving charged particles that pervade our Milky Way galaxy. The electrons sparked some interesting reactions. The team detected many complex, carbon-containing organic molecules, including nine different amino acids and at least two dipeptides. The new study, which was published online last week in The Astrophysical Journal, breaks ground by showing that molecules as complex as dipeptides can probably form far from Earth. But it also adds to a growing body of evidence indicating that organics may be common throughout the solar system. Amino acids have been found in comets and meteorites, and organics swirl about in the thick, nitrogen-based atmosphere of Saturn's huge moon Titan. Many researchers think organics are also common on the dwarf planet Pluto and other objects in the Kuiper Belt, the ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit.

Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates.  But I can use this background: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year.  What is an answer for this question: Which student knew more about tectonic plate pull? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Bobby, who learned more about divergent tectonic plates, knew more about tectonic plate pull. This is because the motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges, which are associated with divergent tectonic plates, is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure. In divergent plate boundaries, the plates are pulled apart, resulting in seafloor spreading, the formation of new seabed, and the presence of hydrothermal vents. Since Nate was more confident in explaining everything about convergent plates, his knowledge primarily focused on different processes than tectonic plate pull."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Gently place this on your face and let it sit for one to two minutes. This will open your pores and prepare the skin on your face for exfoliation. Exfoliation is one of the most effective means to get rid of dead skin. Be careful that you use a warm and not scalding hot towel. After using the warm towel, the next step is to wash your face using a mild cleanser (such as Cetaphil) — the same as the one you likely already use on a daily basis as part of good skin care. Cleaning your skin can further help to open the pores and better prepare the skin on your face for effective exfoliation.  After washing, gently pat your skin with a dry towel. Be gentle and do not rub too vigorously, to avoid causing any damage to your skin. You may try standing in front of a fan to dry your body, especially hard to reach areas. There are two types of exfoliation: physical, and chemical. Physical exfoliation is when you physically use a product that scrapes away dead skin cells by the pressure exerted upon them. Examples of tools for physical exfoliation include exfoliating pads and microdermabrasion kits.  Skin-care professionals do not recommend microdermabrasion without the consultation of a doctor or dermatologist first, as you could damage or irritate your skin. Skin-care companies such as L'Oreal, Ponds, Clinique, and Neutrogena are now producing at-home microdermabrasion kits. These generally consist of an abrasive cream or scrub with a special tool for application.  Sometimes they come with a microdermabrasion cloth with fibres that are rougher than normal and meant to remove dead skin cells.  An example is Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion and Peel System. There is a variety of chemical exfoliating products available. Your best bet is to consult a professional in aesthetics or a dermatologist for advice in choosing the right product for you. If you are unable to afford a professional consultation, carefully read the labels of the products and choose one that is suited to your skin type.  After washing your face and gently drying it, carefully apply the chemical exfoliating product. Spread it all over your face, being sure to cover the full surface area. Gently massage the chemical exfoliating agent into your skin. Try delicate circular motions with your fingers. Do not rub too hard, as you do not want to damage your skin inadvertently. Many people exfoliate their neck as well. Some examples of chemical exfoliating agents include a glycolic acid peel or a lactic acid peel. The acidic nature of these peels is part of what makes them so effective. Chemical exfoliation tends to work better than physical exfoliation (in particular for long-term results) because it is able to access deeper layers of the skin. Chemical exfoliation works by breaking chemical bonds, which in turn releases dead skin cells and allows them to shed much more easily. Then gently pat it dry. Leave it for about five minutes to air dry and then finish by applying a moisturizing lotion. Moisturizing lotions are recommended as part of general skin care. They help to prevent early signs of aging and give your skin an overall healthy glow. Basically, all areas of your body are okay to follow this same process of exfoliation (other than sensitive areas and mucous membranes); however, the most common area people use it for is the face and/or the neck. This is because these areas are most visible to the public, and often the highest cosmetic concern for people. Look for exfoliating body scrubs that are made to work on the rest of your body and not your face. Not all exfoliating solutions are products bought in a store. In fact, it's easy to make your own exfoliating creams, peels, and rubs at home, if you prefer a more natural approach. Below are two easy-to-use recipes:  Sugar and Oil Scrub: Combine equal parts brown sugar and any cooking oil (like olive oil, grapeseed oil, etc.) for a highly economical, highly effective skin scrub. Rub into the skin to exfoliate, then rinse with soap and water. Add a tablespoon of honey and a few drops of lemon for extra nutrients. Greek Yogurt and Papaya Enzyme Face Conditioning Mask: Mix 1/2 cup of Greek Yogurt and three tablespoons of mashed up papaya. Apply to face or body, and leave for 15 to 30 minutes. Peel off and rinse face when done.","output":"This article advises on exfoliation techniques for the face and body, emphasizing the importance of preparing skin, using the appropriate exfoliating products and tools, moisturizing, and considering DIY exfoliating recipes for a healthy, glowing complexion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether or not the ship crashes or lands on Earth is unknown.In Antarctica, the winter months of 1982, a helicopter flies hurriedly after a husky. The man riding next to the pilot shoots a rifle and drops grenades hoping to kill the dog. The runs toward an American research base, Outpost 31, where a 12-man research crew is getting ready for the upcoming winter. The helicopter, which they see is from a Norwegian research base, flies in and lands. The Americans watch puzzled as two men that emerge from the helicopter speak frantically in their native language. One of them pulls the pin on a grenade but clumsily throws it behind him. As he frantically tries to find it in the snow, it explodes, killing him and taking the helicopter with it. The pilot (named Matias in the prequel) is shooting his rifle hysterically and talking frantically; no one can understand what he is saying and the man shoots Bennings (Peter Maloney) in his left leg. The camp leader Garry (Donald Moffat) shoots and kills the gibbering man in defense.Puzzled about why the Norwegians were trying to kill the dog, MacReady (Kurt Russell) the team's helicopter pilot, their doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart) and Norris (Charles Hallahan), go to investigate the Norwegian base. Everyone is dead; one of them had barricaded himself in the radio room and is still sitting frozen in his chair, his wrists and throat slit in an apparent suicide. Mac and Copper explore further, finding a large and empty block of ice. Outside in the snow, along with one or two burned human bodies, Mac and Copper find the burnt and frozen corpse of a twisted creature, not man but not beast, either. They bring it back to their own base for an autopsy, but that muddies up the mystery.That night, the new stray husky is locked in with the sled dogs.

Tie back long hair and cover it with a bandanna or towel to prevent the smoke from getting to your hair. If you have a plastic shower cap, then this is ideal because the plastic will protect your hair and it will not pick up any of the smoke’s smell either. The more clothing that you have on, the more likely you will be to collect smoke smell on your clothes. Consider taking off your shirt when you smoke or at least roll up your sleeves. You might also consider wearing a designated smoking jacket (or sweatshirt) when you smoke. You can keep it hidden in your room somewhere and wear it when you need to smoke. Make sure that you wash it at least once per week to keep it from smelling too much. You will need to have something to cover up the smell of the smoke, so try lighting a couple of sticks of incense or a scented candle. If you don’t have any of these things, then you can also spray some air freshener around your room before and after you start smoking. To prevent smoke from escaping to other parts of your house, place a damp towel along the crack beneath your bedroom door. The damp towel will not only block the smoke from getting out of your room and absorb some of the odor as well. You want to try to direct as much smoke as possible out of your room. If smoke can't exit through an open window or duct, the smoke will leave its odor on walls, carpets, furniture and linens. If you happen to have a fireplace duct in your room, then that is even better. Fireplaces are specifically designed to allow smoke to escape a building, so it will be easier to direct smoke out of your room if your room has a fireplace duct. The better the ventilation of your smoking room, the less likely you are to be caught smoking indoors. Turn on a fan to push the smoke toward the window and to help disperse it after it forms. A tabletop fan pointed toward an open window or air duct is ideal. If you are smoking in a bathroom with a ventilator or exhaust fan, turn it on and aim the smoke toward it to quickly eliminate visible smoke and odors. The special ventilators work by sucking up excess moisture and air particles. Even though you may have kept the smoke from filling your room, you will most likely have some lingering smoke smell on you. Do what you can to cover up the smell of the smoke. For example, you can apply some aftershave on your fingertips, peel and eat an orange, or use a strong scented body spray on yourself.

Which entity is this text about? , Malcolm Denzil Marshall (18 April 1958 - 4 November 1999) was a West Indian cricketer. Primarily a fast bowler, Marshall is regarded as one of the finest and fastest pacemen ever to have played Test cricket. His Test bowling average of 20.94 is the best of anyone who has taken 200 or more wickets. He achieved his bowling success despite being, by the standards of other fast bowlers, a short man - he stood at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), while most of the great quicks have been well above 6 feet (1.8 m) and many great West Indian fast bowlers, such as Joel Garner, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, were 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) or above. Marshall made his Test debut in the Second Test at Bangalore on 15 December 1978. He immediately developed a career-long antipathy to Dilip Vengsarkar due to his aggressive appealing. Despite doing little of note in the three Tests he played on that tour, he did take 37 wickets in all first-class games, and Hampshire saw enough in him to take him on as their overseas player for 1979, remaining with the county until 1993. He was in West Indies' World Cup squad, but did not play a match in the tournament. Hampshire were not doing well at the time, but nevertheless he took 47 first-class wickets, as well as picking up 5-13 against Glamorgan in the John Player League.  Marshall came to prominence in 1980, when in the third Test at Old Trafford he accounted for Mike Gatting, Brian Rose and Peter Willey in short order to spark an England collapse, although the match was eventually drawn despite Marshall taking 7-24. After 1980/81 he was out of the Test side for two years, but an excellent 1982 season when he took 134 wickets at under 16 apiece, including a career-best 8-71 against Worcestershire, saw him recalled and thereafter he remained a fixture until the end of his international career.  In seven successive Test series from 1982/83 to 1985/86 he took 21 or more wickets each time, in the last five of them averaging under 20. His most productive series in this period was the 1983/84 rubber against India, when he claimed 33 wickets as well as averaging 34 with the bat and making his highest Test score of 92 at Kanpur. A few months later he took five in an innings twice at home against Australia. At the peak of his career, he turned down an offer of US1 million to join a rebel West Indies team on a tour to South Africa, still suffering international sporting isolation due to apartheid.

Cover must now be obtained for ‘any motor vehicle intended for travel on land and propelled by mechanical power’. Dangerous: Graham Davies, 46, council gardener mows the grass on a ride-on lawnmower, which is just one of the kinds of vehicles that may now have to be covered by motor insurance under a new EU directive.

There is also concern that insurance costs could rise for all drivers. The ruling comes following a European legal case involving a Slovenian, Damijan Vnuk.

Because it involved a vehicle being used as an ‘agricultural machine’ and took place on private property, motor insurers refused to cover the claim.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Suspect in Northridge shootings arrested in Las Vegas, police say Los Angeles Police Department detectives have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting deaths of four people in Northridge outside an unlicensed boarding home, department officials confirmed. Few details were released about the circumstances of the arrest, which took place without incident overnight in Las Vegas, according to several sources familiar with the case. A news conference is planned for later Tuesday. Police would not immediately identify the suspect, citing the ongoing investigation, but said he was involved in the shooting early Sunday in the 17400 block of Devonshire Street. PHOTOS: Four killed in shooting at Northridge home Sources said the shooting may have been prompted by a personal dispute, but did not elaborate. Officers responded to a home about 4:25 a.m. Sunday after a 911 caller reported yelling and shots fired, police said. Authorities found four people — two men and two women — shot dead outside. No weapon was recovered at the home, prompting police to rule out a murder-suicide. Three of the victims — a man and two women — were shot on the walkway on the left side of the home, a source familiar with the case told The Times on Monday. They were all wearing hooded sweat shirts and were about two feet apart from one another. All three had at least one bullet wound to the head. One victim was crumpled on her knees, the source said, her face buried in the palms of her hands, \\"almost like she was praying.\\" The other two victims on the walkway were face down. The fourth victim — a man — was farther away and appeared as if he was trying to run to the backyard when he was shot. He had at least one gunshot wound, according to the source. \\"It looked like a quick kill,\\" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is ongoing. The names of the victims have not been released. Police said the women were in their mid-20s; one man was in his mid-30s and the other man in his late 40s. Authorities said the home was an illegal boardinghouse, with up to 17 people living in conditions that Los Angeles City Councilman Mitchell Englander described as \\"deplorable.\\" The home had so much debris and so many partitions that one room could be accessed only through a window, he said. A trail of extension cords led investigators to the backyard, where several makeshift living quarters had been assembled. The owner of the home, Yag Kapil, said he rented out rooms but denied he was running a boardinghouse. Kapil, 78, who lives at the home, said he is bedridden and was sleeping at the time of the shootings. He said he didn't hear anything and didn't know the victims. The slayings stunned the quiet Northridge street, which residents said was the kind where neighbors knew each other and walked to the grocery store or synagogue nearby. \\"It's usually sleepy-time America,\\" said Richard Rutherford, 58, who was awakened by the gunfire. The violent crime rate for Northridge falls in the middle of all Los Angeles neighborhoods, but homicide is rare in the community, according to LAPD data analyzed in The Times' Crime L.A. database. In the previous six months, Northridge had one homicide out of the 89 violent crimes reported. Since 2007, and before Sunday's quadruple homicide, Northridge had 11 homicides, 10 of them south of Nordhoff Street. The location of Sunday's slayings is on the border with Granada Hills, which typically has a much lower violent-crime rate than Northridge.

News article: Milan Fashion Week Spring 2015 ends after a flurry of cool and casual runway looks MILAN — Reflecting on a Milan Fashion Week that marked the re-emergence of denim and the pre-eminence of the flat Birkenstock-inspired sandal, the question was bound to surface: Wherein lies luxury? Milan designers, who crammed the usual six days of womenswear previews for next summer into 4 ½ ending Sunday, are clear on their response: in Italy's artisanal traditions. Whether reviving the dying art of brocade in the factories north of Milan, perfecting sartorial crafts to create new shapes, or honoring the centuries-old Murano glass-blowing traditions with textiles mimicking its melting striations, Milan designers touted Made in Italy, the calling card that distinguishes Italian brands and, more often than one might expect, raises ready-to-wear to an art form. Giorgio Armani, who rolled out the summer collection that will herald his company's 40th anniversary, is all about mastery — but avoids the term luxury altogether. \\"Luxury is surrounded by other things, super-decorated stores,\\" Armani told reporters last week after showing his main Giorgio Armani line. \\"Rich can be of substance, refer to content, to the workmanship. Sometimes luxury has zero workmanship.\\" One can quibble about the definition of luxury, but glamour certainly had its place at this round of fashion previews. Heidi Klum supported her pals at Versace and Roberto Cavalli; Oscar-winner Paolo Sorrentino made a film for and an appearance at Armani; Kate Moss chatted up Anna Wintour at Gucci; and Amy Adams took the front row at Max Mara. Star models also took their turn: Naomi Campbell strode for Pucci, while Georgia May Jagger showed for Fendi. And amFAR tap-Yped the fashion crowd's deep pockets to raise 1.4 million to fund research toward its goal of finding a cure for AIDS by 2020. Perhaps the biggest trend out of Milan were light looks, effortless without being ethereal, from billowing floor-length Georgette dresses that trail on the ground to paper-thin trench coats, super-fine knitwear to translucent layering, over and under. These looks were understated, suggesting more than they reveal, and inviting motion. Dresses were all covering, but still clung momentarily to the body with every step. At Armani, the lightness was reinforced by the tailoring, soft-peplums and wide-legged trousers that tapered elegantly at the calf, and complemented by prints mimicking gentle waves left in the sand by the wind. Max Mara focused on lightweight long trenches in florals that dissolved into animal prints, Roberto Cavalli kept pace with long sexy gowns, and Missoni created diaphanous, maxi-dresses from knitwear as light as air and as delicate as lace. Designers took us on a psychedelic trip back to the fashion-rich 1970s. The hippie looks were crafted out of suede — a must for next season — denim (will get to that later), and leather, with heavy helpings of fringe, beading, laser cut detailing, macrame and even granny squares. Get out the crochet needles! Looks from Armani, left, and Marni, right. Up-and-comer Marco de Vincenzo, with LVMH's backing, deployed his fringe in an orderly fashion on coats and dresses, while Etro was more true to the chilled-out looks of San Francisco's hippy heyday with poncho dresses and laser cut vests. Prada gave us an updated clog with brocade-covered heels. While modesty was the rule in Milan, Costume National bared some skin with a macrame mini-dress and a halter top with harem pants. Some critics fretted that the 1970s is an old fashion saw trotted out in moments of creative ennui. But the infectious freedom infused alone by tassels is undeniable, especially once a Doors soundtrack starts playing in your head. Who can forget the 1980s era of designer jeans, with the focus on tight and all eyes on the shapely tush. The Milan Denim Revival of 2015 is nothing if not a relief from that stomach-sucking era. Italy's designers have volleyed back with relaxed denim looks, turning their nose up at spandex and jeggings that have made tight jeans any (wo)man's game. Denim trousers are easy-to-wear, wide-legged and cropped — a look that renews emphasis on the shoe. Jeans are also dressed up, with lace panels, floral appliques, brocade beneath distressed tears and of course, rhinestones. At Emporio Armani, they fit Giorgio Armani's passion for blue and included wide-legged denim with a shiny, cropped cuff, dressed up with short tailored jackets. Karl Lagerfeld says women are increasingly asking for denim and he obliged with jodhpur-styled jeans for Fendi. Gucci came out with mariner-front styles cropped at the calf. Ermanno Scervino dressed up faded denim wrap skirts — the skirt silhouette of choice for next summer — hooded overcoats and shorts with contrasting denim appliques. If there was a battle cry this season, it was ready-to-wear made easy-to-wear. With this, came an emphasis on active wear. Some was dance-inspired, others took light-hearted cues from Magna figures, decorated with sequined icons of ice cream and lips, and yet others derived from minimalist tendencies. Dancer's wraps have long come out of the studio, and here they are again on the street. Leggings and shape-hugging T's gain new respectability under long trench coats. And big-fitting sweatshirts worn with wide-legged shorts form a distance can seem a well-coordinated dress. Ten-inch heels will be rotating to the back of the closet next summer. To the fore: more forgiving wedge and platform sandals, and a fair bit of flats, including sneakers. Much of the footwear may tip an evolutionary nod to Birkenstocks, but designers raised the game, by incorporating geometric elements into the platforms, and, of course, luxury materials. Sneakers also got a dressing up, with versions that go all the way up the knee with multi-colored straps for a gladiator-esque effect and sprinkled with Swarowski crystals for eveningwear. There was a tendency to mix informal with the formal: casual shoes with dressy looks, and vice versa. And what's good for the shoes, is good for the bags, say Milan designers.

The house and property were designed by Calvert Vaux in 1862. Hypothesis: Ashcroft House has a thatched roof","output":"Given the context provided, it appears that we cannot draw the hypothesis that Ashcroft House has a thatched roof. The text explicitly states that Ashcroft is a 2 1/2-story brick home with a high pitched slate roof with projecting eaves. The materials and composition of the roof are clearly mentioned, and a slate roof is not the same as a thatched roof. A thatched roof is made from plant materials, such as straw, water reed, or long-stemmed grasses, which are layered together to create the roof covering. Thatching is an ancient method of constructing roofs that has been used in various parts of the world for thousands of years. These roofs provide good insulation, are lightweight, and environmentally friendly. However, thatched roofs require regular maintenance, can be prone to damage from harsh weather, and have a higher risk of catching fire as they are made of dry plant material. On the other hand, a slate roof is made from slate tiles, which are naturally occurring stone materials. Slate is a durable roofing material, known for its longevity and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions. A well-maintained slate roof can last over a century, making it a popular choice for historic and architecturally significant buildings like the Ashcroft House mentioned in the context. Therefore, based on the information provided in the context, we cannot support the hypothesis that Ashcroft House has a thatched roof, as it clearly states that the house has a slate roof, a different roofing material entirely."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Steven Paul Smith was born at the Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, the only child of Gary Smith, a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Bunny Kay Berryman, an elementary school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: \\"I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there.\\" His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of \\"the most recent eight songs that [he'd] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar\\" to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was expecting only a deal for a seven-inch record.  Regarding the record, Smith said: \\"I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular ... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed [Heatmiser], unfortunately.\\" Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: \\"The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest--Mudhoney and Nirvana--and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.\\"  The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled \\"Kiwi Maddog 20/20\\" (a reference to the low-end fortified wine), had full band instrumentation.  One of Smith's first solo performances was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set being B-sides, Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, Smith was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. She later recorded one of his songs, \\"I Figured You Out\\", which he had discarded for sounding \\"too much like the Eagles\\".  The same year, Smith released a split 7\\" single with Pete Krebs, contributing the track \\"No Confidence Man\\" as the single's B-side.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Three in four British women would choose a man with love handles over one sporting a six-pack. That's 23 million of us who find muscular men a turn off; 96% predict a date with an abs-obsessed bloke to be positively dreary. These stats are the result of a study commissioned to mark the DVD release of Bad Neighbours, a film featuring numerous shirtless scenes of actors Seth Rogen (in the flab corner) and Zac Effron (in the abs). Scroll down for video. A recent study revealed that when it comes to body types, women prefer their man to have a little more to love. Let's be clear here: these results don't mean women won't be eyeing off Zac's 'V' line: the muscular line running from the hip bone to the groin. Did they audition chubby men for the highly anticipated film of Fifty Shades of Grey? I don't think so. We will ogle, we will fantasise. But when it comes to real life, we don't want chiselled perfection in our bed. The question is: why on earth not? Why don't women want some hot, buff, perfect-bodied man lying beside us? The sad answer is this: we're worried we won't shape up. Seventy-four percent of women in the survey said they'd feel self-conscious taking their clothes off in front of a perfectly toned man. A he-man's discipline highlights our lack of it, making us feel even more acutely self-conscious of our own body flaws than usual. Tracey says we avoid relationships with fitter men because we don't believe we can live up to their standards. We feel far more comfortable with flab because it's less threatening. Women are already under extreme pressure to look a certain way and be a certain weight. Anyone who ever doubted that women are judged by their physical appearance far more than men, need only have witnessed the media coverage of the unveiling of Cameron's female MP's: nearly all of it focused on what they wore and what they look like. It takes robust self-esteem and an unshakeable body image to stay objective about our weight in a society where the body ideal is so unachievable, even models struggle to maintain it. Is it any wonder women figure - usually quite rightly - that a man who is less critical of his own appearance and less looks-obsessed will be less critical of ours? Mr Non-Perfect is a relief to any woman who steps on the scales, every day of her life, and finds her mood is affected, every day of her life, by what they say. Especially when it comes to sex. I'd love to meet a female whose sex life isn't affected by a 'fat day'. I've yet to meet one man who has let feeling fat stop them having sex. Tracey says that when it comes to sex, women are far more concerned about weight than men. Michael Alvear, the author of 'Not tonight dear, I feel fat', says fifty percent of women admit they've put off sex - even when they're in the mood - because they felt too fat. 'Women put conditions on sex because of weight. You won't do it without cover-up clothing. You only have sex with the lights out. You'll only do positions that prevent your partner from looking at or touching certain parts of your body,' he says. 'Pretty soon your desire for any sex, conditional or not, goes away.' We don't just think our partners won't desire us unless we are thin. We don't feel desirable unless we are thin. There are many (many) things men can learn from women, but this is one area where women can learn from men. When men look in the mirror, they look at the parts of themselves that they like. I showed four male friends the publicity stills of the ab-tastic Zac Efron and they all shrugged and said, 'He looks good. But he's paid to look like that. That's his job.' They made no comparison to themselves. There was no subconscious sucking in of their beer belly. No wistful glance at their not-so-bulging biceps. When women look in the mirror, they hone in on the bits they don't like. Show us a picture of Cameron Diaz in a bikini and we think 'Why don't I look like that? I better not eat anything else for the rest of the day and hit the gym after work'. It's a continuing double standard that's not working for anyone - men or women. We should all be more Seth-like: learn to love our bellies and accept that wobbly bits are all part of being mere mortals. Find out more about sex and relationships at traceycox.com.

Chewing, in which food is mixed with saliva begins the process of digestion. This produces a bolus which can be swallowed down the esophagus and into the stomach. Here it is mixed with gastric juice until it passes into the duodenum where it is mixed with a number of enzymes produced by the pancreas. Saliva also contains a catalytic enzyme called amylase which starts to act on food in the mouth. Another digestive enzyme called lingual lipase is secreted by some of the lingual papillae on the tongue and also from serous glands in the main salivary glands. Digestion is helped by the mastication of food by the teeth and also by the muscular actions of peristalsis and segmentation contractions. Gastric juice in the stomach is essential for the continuation of digestion as is the production of mucus in the stomach. See options at the end. Can we conclude that is the esophagus part of the digestive tract? OPTIONS: [1]. no [2]. yes","output":"[2]. yes We can conclude that the esophagus is part of the digestive tract. The esophagus is like a tube that helps move the food we chew (called a bolus) from our mouth down to our stomach, where it can be mixed with juices and continue being broken down.

So, the esophagus plays a big role in the digestive process, making it part of the digestive tract.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Someone is infected with bacteria - That bacteria begins to grow and reproduce inside the cells - The dividing bacteria begin to make toxins - Those toxins damage your cells - Disease symptoms may begin.  Question: suppose resting or sleeping happens, how will it affect the person is infected with more bacteria.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"Resting or sleeping can have both positive and negative effects on a person infected with bacteria, depending on various factors such as the stage of infection, overall health, and the immune system function. However, it's important to note that one's general health, including their immune response, can be significantly influenced by their sleep habits. Therefore, a combination of factors needs to be considered to provide a comprehensive answer. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy immune system. During restful sleep, the body produces cytokines and other immune-responsive molecules, which help the immune system work effectively against pathogenic invaders, including bacteria. Adequate sleep allows the body to engage more effectively in fighting the bacterial infection, preventing the bacteria from growing and reproducing too rapidly, consequently producing less toxins and causing less damage to one's cells. In this context, resting or sleeping would lead to answer B: less bacteria. However, there are scenarios where resting or sleeping may not be as beneficial. In the initial stages of infection or until the body detects the presence of pathogenic bacteria, the immune system may not be sufficiently activated. In such cases, resting or sleeping may not have a significant impact on the spread of bacteria, especially if the person is suffering from chronic sleep disorders, stress, or a weakened immune system. In this case, the answer could be C: no effect. On the other hand, if the bacterial infection becomes severe or reaches systemic levels (sepsis), rest and sleep alone may not be enough to fight the bacteria. In these cases, immediate medical intervention, including antibiotics, is crucial to prevent further complications. Resting or sleeping without proper medical treatment may lead to the continual growth and reproduction of bacteria, causing an increase in toxin production and subsequently more severe symptoms. In such a case, the answer is A: more bacteria. In summary, the impact of resting or sleeping on the progression of bacterial infection depends on multiple factors, including the individual's overall health, the stage of infection, and the presence of any sleep disorders or medical conditions influencing the immune response. Generally speaking, adequate sleep and rest are essential for maintaining a healthy immune system, but in some cases, other interventions may also be required to ensure appropriate bacterial control. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and guidance on how to manage a bacterial infection effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To that end, he measured the time perceived by an airline pilot, who naturally traveled very fast. He labeled it as case A. To compare the pilot with a slower traveler he measured the time perceived by a semi truck driver covering the same distance. He labeled it as case B. He was amazed by the counter intuitive results he got from the experiment.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   According to Einstein, would case B perceive the distance shorter or longer than case A?  Hint: Einstein showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on cause and effect, measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Subatomic particles exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \\"slow down\\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \\"warped\\") by high-speed motion.","output":"According to Einstein, case B (the semi truck driver) would perceive the distance as longer than case A (the airline pilot). This is because, as per the theory of relativity, as objects move faster, distances seem to shorten, and time seems to \\"slow down\\" for the fast-moving object. Since the airline pilot is traveling at a much faster speed than the semi truck driver, the distance would be perceived as shorter for case A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a rock musical about a fictional rock and roll band fronted by a transgender East German singer, Hedwig Robinson. The book is by John Cameron Mitchell, and the music and lyrics are by Stephen Trask. The story draws on Mitchell's life as the son of a U.S. Army Major General who once commanded the U.S. sector of occupied West Berlin. The character of Hedwig was inspired by a German divorced U.S. Army wife who was a Mitchell family babysitter and moonlighted as a prostitute at her Junction City, Kansas, trailer park home. The character of Hedwig was originally a supporting character in the piece. She was loosely inspired by a German female babysitter/prostitute who worked for Mitchell's family when he was a teenager in Junction City, Kansas. The character of Tommy, originally conceived as the main character, was based on Mitchell himself: both were gay, the sons of an army general, deeply Roman Catholic, and fascinated with mythology. Hedwig became the story's protagonist when Trask encouraged Mitchell to showcase their earliest material in 1994 at NYC's drag-punk club Squeezebox, where Trask headed the house band and Mitchell's boyfriend, Jack Steeb, played bass.  They agreed the piece should be developed through band gigs in clubs rather than in a theater setting in order to preserve a rock energy. Mitchell was deeply influenced by Squeezebox's roster of drag performers who performed rock covers. The setlists of Hedwig's first gigs included many covers with lyrics rewritten by Mitchell to tell Hedwig's story: Fleetwood Mac's \\"Oh Well\\"; Television's \\"See No Evil\\"; Wreckless Eric's \\"Whole Wide World\\"; Yoko Ono's \\"Death of Samantha\\"; Pere Ubu's \\"Non-Alignment Pact\\"; Cher's \\"Half Breed\\"; David Bowie's \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\"; Mott the Hoople's \\"All the Young Dudes\\"; and the Velvet Underground's \\"Femme Fatale.\\" A German glam rendition of Debby Boone's \\"You Light Up My Life\\" once served as the musical's finale.  Mitchell's second gig was as fill-in host at Squeezebox on a bill featuring singer Deborah Harry of Blondie. It was for this occasion that Mike Potter first designed Hedwig's trademark wig, which was initially constructed from toilet paper rolls wrapped with synthetic blond hair. Mitchell, Trask, and the band Cheater (Jack Steeb, Chris Wielding, Dave McKinley, and Scott Bilbrey) continued to workshop material at venues such as Fez Nightclub and Westbeth Theater Center for four years before premiering the completed musical Off-Broadway in 1998.  Mitchell has explained that Hedwig is not a trans woman, but a genderqueer character. \\"She's more than a woman or a man,\\" he has said. \\"She's a gender of one and that is accidentally so beautiful.\\" What was her name?","output":"The character's name is Hedwig Robinson.

On the left side, there are no like terms to combine. On the right side, combine the t terms: 31*t - 24*t = 7*t Now, the equation looks like this: 22*t - 242 = 7*t + 268 Step 2: Isolate the variable t. To do this, we'll first move the 7*t term on the right side of the equation to the left by subtracting 7*t from both sides: 22*t - 7*t - 242 = 7*t - 7*t + 268 This simplifies to: 15*t - 242 = 268 Now, let's move the constant term on the left side of the equation to the right by adding 242 to both sides: 15*t - 242 + 242 = 268 + 242 This simplifies to: 15*t = 510 Step 3: Solve for t.

Please write a short summary for the following article: GOP governor in tough race in deep-red Kansas -- though stripper tale could dent rival An anti-incumbent mood is threatening powerful Republicans in traditionally conservative Kansas this year, and not even Sam Brownback -- who represented the state in Congress for 16 years and now serves as governor -- is safe. Lately, the state's tumultuous Senate race, where GOP Sen. Pat Roberts faces a tough challenge from an independent candidate, has attracted national attention. But Brownback's bid for a second term is equally tenuous. Polls show Democratic rival, state House Minority Leader Paul Davis, with a slight but consistent lead. A recent Fox News poll showed the challenger up 4 percentage points. \\"Voters in Kansas are just frustrated and they're in a strongly anti-incumbent mood,\\" said Chapman Rackaway, a political science professor at Fort Hays State University in Kansas. \\"The fact that Kansas is a red state means most of our incumbents are Republicans, and the anti-incumbent sentiment is going to go against them.\\" Rackaway said some of Brownback's political woes are due to a rift in the GOP in the state. In July, several moderate conservatives threw their support behind Davis. Rackaway said while he doesn't think it will tear a large number of Republican votes from the Brownback campaign, \\"it certainly didn't help.\\" Then there's the governor's controversial tax-cut plan. Brownback pushed a tax overhaul in 2012, which included a 25 percent reduction in the top income tax rate. It also lowered the state sales tax and eliminated a tax on small business income. It was a move the governor hoped would stimulate the economy. But critics say the cuts have hurt the state budget and led to a recent Standard & Poor's credit rating downgrade from AA+ to AA. The credit rating report cited an imbalance between revenues and spending in the state budget. \\"Certainly the governor's very aggressive move to mimic Texas' tax structure has caused some controversy, because the revenue numbers have not only been estimated down but even failed to meet estimates throughout the summer,\\" Rackaway said. Brownback campaign spokesman John Milburn said while the numbers are down, it's to be expected. \\"We said all along when the tax cuts were enacted that there would be some declines in revenues. That's what happens when you tax less, you collect less,\\" said Milburn, adding that they're starting to see some positive growth. Brownback, though, isn't the only candidate on defense right now. While the governor defends the tax program, his Democratic opponent is busy explaining a more sensational issue -- an incident at a strip club in 1998. Davis at the time was found at \\"Secrets\\" in Coffeyville, Kan., during a police raid. He was then a single 26-year-old lawyer and, according to a report obtained by Politico and other outlets, was found with a stripper in a back room in a \\"compromising position.\\" Davis said the club was a client of the law firm he worked at, and the raid happened well before he entered state politics. In an email to the Wichita Eagle newspaper, Chris Pumpelly, spokesman for the Davis campaign, said the strip club story was orchestrated by a Brownback aide as part of a \\"smear campaign\\" on Davis, and said the Brownback campaign had used taxpayer resources to dig up the old police report. According to the Wichita Eagle, a state official who works in Brownback's administration made the initial police report request just a few days before a small local paper requested the report and published it. Milburn told the Wichita Eagle the state official who sought the police report was allowed by state law to perform campaign work and did not illegally use taxpayer money. Davis gave a statement to Politico about the bust saying, \\"When I was 26 years old, I was taken to a club by my boss -- the club owner was one of our legal clients. While we were in the building, the police showed up. I was never accused of having done anything wrong, but rather I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\" The Davis campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News. A large number of independent voters are putting their support behind Davis, hurting Brownback's lead. However, the late campaign strip club news could help throw independents back to the governor's campaign. \\"Issues of character and judgment are things [independents] latch on to,\\" said Rackaway, adding he believes Kansans will see the campaigns turn more personal as Election Day gets closer. Rackaway also said the Davis campaign has focused a lot on Brownback's alleged missteps but hasn't defined Davis enough, allowing Brownback's campaign to fill that role. While the gubernatorial candidates are entering a heated last few weeks of the race, the other Republican having trouble in the usually deep-red state is long-time Sen. Pat Roberts. He's in a surprisingly close race against independent Greg Orman who has not said publicly if he would caucus with Democrats or Republicans were he to win. Orman's bid became instantly competitive after Democrat Chad Taylor took himself out of the race. GOP heavyweights have been making stops in Kansas to stump for both the struggling senator and governor, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Arizona Sen. John McCain, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. Lauren Blanchard is part of the Junior Reporter program at Fox News.

So now, we have: -68 = -17 * h Our primary goal is to isolate the variable \\"h\\". To do this, we have to get rid of the coefficient -17 in front of the variable.

[b]. positive.","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be classified as [a]. negative. Understanding the context, the sentence “didn't get to see her boyfriend last night...” suggests an event that did not occur as per the individual's desire or expectation. In general, people usually look forward to seeing their loved ones and any deviation from this expectation tends to evoke negative emotions. The tweet does not provide any other signs of positive implications, such as the person being happily occupied with other activities or being relieved due to a need for personal space. In absence of these additional elements, the sentiment can be interpreted as at least somewhat negative. The ellipsis at the end may be a hint for disappointment or sadness over the non-event, which again, suggests a negative sentiment. However, it is important to note that sentiment analysis is primarily about spotting opinion or mood, rather than inferring deeper contextual circumstances or reasons behind a sentiment. The sentiment is determined by emotive density, language tone, and context interpretation. Hence, based on the given text and perceived emotive density, the sentiment is classified as negative. Furthermore, sentiments are subjective and can be influenced by personal perspectives and cultural contexts. An individual might perceive a certain situation as negative, while another might perceive the same situation as positive or neutral. Therefore, in sentiment analysis, especially in an isolated message like a tweet, the key is to focus on the expressed emotion rather than personal or cultural beliefs. Finally, sentiment analysis algorithms employ machine learning techniques to learn from a set of pre-classified examples and understand the positivity, negativity, or neutrality of a text, focusing on specific key words and their context. In this case, words like 'didn't' and 'get to see' are likely to be correlated with negative tones in many algorithms' training sets, further supporting the classification of this tweet as negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer). Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. The band never intended to create dance music, however, previous releases were popular across nightclubs in North America and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Supernature debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the UK. As of February 2008, it had sold one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and \\"Ooh La La\\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording. The song was used for the iPhone 5S's commercial in 2013.  \\"Ooh La La\\", the album's lead single, became Goldfrapp's first UK top five single. The song was chosen as the lead single \\"because it was up and in your face and carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album\\". \\"Ooh La La\\" became the first song performed by the band to feature the electric guitar and was cited as a highlight of the album by Allmusic. \\"Number 1\\" was released as the album's second single. Constructed around a synthesiser and bass arrangement, it was written about the importance of relationships. The album's third single \\"Ride a White Horse\\" was inspired by the disco era and reached number 15 in the UK. \\"Fly Me Away\\" was released as the album's fourth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors.  In 2006, Goldfrapp released We Are Glitter, a North American-only compilation of remixes from Supernature. It included a Flaming Lips remix of \\"Satin Chic\\", the band's favourite song from the album. Was Supernature one of their albums or songs?","output":"Supernature was one of Goldfrapp's albums.

Would \\"Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians, such as Harold Innis , Donald Creighton and Arthur R. M. Lower\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"No, the statement provided, \\"Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians, such as Harold Innis, Donald Creighton and Arthur R. M. Lower,\\" is not a suitable answer to the question regarding the major economic activities of Early Canadians. It is a statement about historians who studied and contributed to the knowledge of Canadian economic history, rather than an explanation of the economic activities themselves. To answer the question, let's discuss the major economic activities of early Canadians. Early Canada's economy was primarily based on natural resources and their trade, which started with the initial contact between Europeans and Indigenous peoples. The economic activities can be broadly categorized into the following: 1. Fur trade: The fur trade was the backbone of the early Canadian economy, starting in the 16th century and peaking in the 18th century. The demand for furs, particularly beaver pelts for hats, in Europe led to extensive trading networks between Indigenous peoples and European traders. The Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company were the major organizations involved in the fur trade. 2. Timber trade: Canada's vast forests played a significant role in its early economy. The timber trade began in the late 18th century, supported by the growing British demand for shipbuilding material and an American market for construction lumber in the 19th century. The industry led to the construction of sawmills, the development of infrastructure, and increased European settlement in Canada. 3. Agriculture: Early settlements in Canada, especially in Upper and Lower Canada, relied on agriculture for subsistence and trade. Farmers primarily cultivated crops like wheat and barley; livestock farming was also significant, with cattle, sheep, and pigs being commonly raised. Agricultural advancements and improved transportation allowed for greater trade opportunities between regions and with the United States. 4. Fishing: Abundant marine resources along Canada's Atlantic coast facilitated a prosperous fishing industry, especially in the Newfoundland and Nova Scotia regions. Cod was the most sought-after fish, and its salted and dried forms were exported to Europe and the Caribbean. This industry led to the establishment of fishing communities and trade networks across the Atlantic. 5. Mining: With the discovery of valuable minerals and ores such as copper, lead, and gold in different parts of the 19th-century Canada, mining activities began to expand. Some notable examples include the gold rushes in British Columbia and the Klondike in the Yukon. The mining industry facilitated population growth, urbanization, and the further development of rail infrastructure. In summary, the major economic activities of early Canadians were largely centered around the fur trade, timber trade, agriculture, fishing, and mining. These activities were tied closely to the rich natural resources that Canada had to offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which sample would not need oxygen for growth, sample A or sample C?  Microbiologist John is studying the anaerobic organism. He collected two samples of this organism, sample A and sample B. Sample A is an anaerobic organism, and sample B is specifically identified as the Clostridium perfringens obligate anaerobe. To compare these samples to other organisms he collected another microbe that is not an anaerobic organism. He labeled it as sample C.  Hint: An anaerobic organism is any organism that does not need oxygen for growth and even dies in its presence. Obligate anaerobes will die when exposed to atmospheric levels of oxygen. Clostridium perfringens bacteria, which are commonly found in soil around the world, are obligate anaerobes. Infection of a wound by C. perfringens bacteria causes the disease gas gangrene. Obligate anaerobes use molecules other than oxygen as terminal electron acceptors.","output":"Sample A would not need oxygen for growth. This is because sample A is an anaerobic organism, which means it does not require oxygen for growth and may even die in its presence. On the other hand, sample C is not an anaerobic organism, so it likely requires oxygen for growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The special event included a selection of popular Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOMs), during which Westlife and other artists performed songs as part of the soundtrack or in connection with these films. In this particular case, \\"World of Our Own\\" is connected to multiple DCOMs aired as part of the special and cannot be attributed to a single movie. However, Westlife was indeed actively involved in this unique event in 2003, which highlighted their song as a prominent part of the special. The \\"Westlife: Disney Channel Music Special\\" was created in response to the immense popularity of both Disney Channel Original Movies and the boy band at that time, combining their respective appeals into a special musical celebration for Disney Channel viewers. Some of the popular Disney Channel Original Movies released around that time include The Cheetah Girls (2003), The Even Stevens Movie (2003), and The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003). While \\"World of Our Own\\" may not have been featured in these specific films as part of the soundtrack, it was still a prominent part of the music special aired on the Disney Channel, which shines a light on Westlife's contribution to Disney Channel's entertainment scene during that period.

Movie plot title: Strangers on a Train Movie plot: Amateur Tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) wants to divorce his vulgar and unfaithful wife Miriam (Laura Elliott), so he can marry the elegant and beautiful Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), daughter of a senator (Leo G. Carroll). While on a train to meet Miriam, Haines encounters Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), a pushy stranger who recognizes Guy from gossip items in the newspapers and wants to discuss his marital problems. During lunch in Bruno's compartment, Bruno tells Guy about his idea for the perfect \\"criss-cross\\" murder(s): he will kill Miriam, and in exchange Guy will kill Bruno's father. Since they are unconnected strangers, there is no identifiable motive for the crimes, and therefore no suspicion from the police. Guy hurriedly departs the compartment, but leaves Bruno thinking he has agreed to the deal. Guy accidentally leaves his cigarette lighter behind, and Bruno pockets it. Guy meets Miriam at her work, where she decides to call off the divorce and play the Washington political wife.

Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Ti is Positive . The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080  Ti  (1080 Ti for short) is one of the best GPUs on the market right now for PC gaming  but the units are becoming harder to find as retailers can't keep up with the increased demand brought on by cryptocurrency miners. Many 1080 Ti models are regularly out of stock through online retailers  or are getting marked up to higher and higher prices. The 1080  Ti  typically goes for around 1 000 or less  and  it  used to be pretty easy to find online. Now popular retailers like Newegg that sell the GPUs list dozens of models as \\"out of stock \\" while other online marketplaces like Amazon or eBay have prices marked up by hundreds or sometimes even thousands of dollars. What makes  the 1080 Ti  so appealing to both gamers and cryptocurrency miners is its 11 GB of GDDR5X memory running at 11 GBps  which means it can handle a lot of processes very quickly. For gamers  this means high-quality imaging and high frames per second. For miners  this means a faster rate of mining. For gamers who are looking to upgrade their PCs to play hardware-demanding games or make their games look better  the shortage means 1080  Ti  is a less-desirable GPU. Why wait or pay up for one when you can get a slightly lower quality GPU for less money and hassle? Unfortunately  other GPUs close in capabilities to the 1080 Ti â like the 1070 Ti or Radeon RX 580 â are experiencing similar shortages and markups (although not quite to the same degree). RX 580 GPUs are also being sold in bundles specifically for mining  and no gamer would need four or more GPUs to play even the most demanding games. This shortage probably isn't forever  though. If the cryptocurrency bubble ever bursts  the hype will probably die down and everything will go back to normal. Plus  whatever the next generation of GPUs is will make 1080  Ti  cards much easier to find and buy.

The food is what really makes this restaurant pop. I recommend you try the daily specials off of a dry erase board which varies based on the fresh food and ingredients that are available to the chefs. I was told by the staff some of the items are flown in from Japan. They typically only have a limited number of servings and it is common for them to sell out of the specials. On my visit, they were sold out of two of the seven items listed. Many of the dishes I ordered were rich in flavor with a varying degree of teriyaki base. I enjoyed the lightly salted dishes more. i recommend the juicy fried chicken, ribs, pork cheek, and mushroom wrapped in bacon.   The portions are small and made to order. You do not know what order the items will come out of the kitchen. However, they will definitely be hot. The prices of the items and the cost of a visit will vary depending on your appetite and food selections. The staff is extremely well versed on the menu items. A reservation is a MUST!!!   Otherwise you will have to wait an hour or more for a table. In that situation, it would be best to leave your name and comeback in the estimated wait time.

We have this equation: -99*i + 253 = 3025 Our job is to find out what number \\"i\\" is. Let's follow these steps to make it really simple. First, let's get rid of the 253 from the left side of the equation so we have only -99*i on the left side and a new number on the right side. We can do this by subtracting 253 from both sides like this: -99*i + 253 - 253 = 3025 - 253 Now, the left side becomes: -99*i = 2772 We got rid of the 253, so now we have: -99*i = 2772 Now we just need to find out what \\"i\\" is. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -99: (-99*i) / -99 = 2772 / -99 When we divide -99*i by -99, we just get 'i': i = -28 So there we have it, the answer to our problem is: i = -28 Remember, \\"i\\" is just a number that helps us solve the problem, and in this case, it's -28.

Why is the number 666 considered Satanic?","output":"While both questions address the connection between the number 666 and Satanism, their phrasings suggest slightly different focuses. Let's examine each question to better understand their nuances and provide a more comprehensive response to both inquiries. 1. How is 666 Satanic? This question seems to ask for an explanation of the ways or mechanisms through which 666 is associated with Satanism. In other words, the focus is on the origin or nature of this association.  2. Why is the number 666 considered Satanic? This question also asks about the connection between 666 and Satanism, but with an emphasis on the reasons behind this consideration. This question seeks to understand why people view the number as Satanic. Now let's provide a detailed and long answer to cover both questions: The association between the number 666 and Satanism can be traced back to the New Testament of the Christian Bible, specifically to the Book of Revelation. The Book of Revelation is a prophetic and apocalyptic text, and one of its most well-known passages is Revelation 13:18, which states: \\"Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.\\" In this context, the \\"beast\\" is often interpreted as an evil figure, usually identified with Satan, the Antichrist, or a representative of a corrupt and demonic power. Throughout the years, various interpretations have attempted to uncover the meaning of 666. One popular theory is that the number refers to the Roman Emperor Nero. Nero was notorious for his tyranny and persecution of Christians, and he has been regarded by some as a prototype of the Antichrist. When his name is transliterated into Hebrew and calculated using gematria, a form of numerology in which letters have corresponding numeric values, Nero's name equates to 666. However, this interpretation is just one of many, and definitive identification remains uncertain. In more recent times, the number 666 has taken on a general symbolic significance in popular culture. It represents evil, malevolence, or rebellion against divine authority. This symbolic association has been reinforced in literature, cinema, and other cultural expressions where the number is used to evoke an ominous or unsettling atmosphere. As a consequence, 666 has become widely associated with Satanism, which is a religious, philosophical, or political movement that deals with the symbolism of Satan, either by venerating the figure or adopting its rebellious stance. Despite its longstanding and complex relationship with Satanism, it is important to note that the number 666, in and of itself, is just a number. It has no intrinsic malevolent or sinister properties. The perceived connection to evil is rooted in religious and cultural interpretations that have evolved over centuries. To devout believers in Christianity, the number 666 may represent warnings and prophetic revelations, whereas, for staunch skeptics or adherents to other religious beliefs, the number may hold little to no significance in their spiritual lives. In summary, both questions address the connection between 666 and Satanism, with slight differences in focus. The number 666 is considered Satanic largely due to its biblical reference in the Book of Revelation and its symbolic history as a signpost of evil. Its interpretation has varied over time, ranging from a specific association with figures like Emperor Nero to a more general cultural symbol of malevolence or rebellion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus \\"Vitis\\".  - Pseudoperonospora is a genus of water moulds which includes several species known for causing downy mildew infections on plants . Species include : Pseudoperonospora cannabina - causes downy mildew on hemp Pseudoperonospora cubensis - causes downy mildew on cucurbits Pseudoperonospora humuli - causes downy mildew on hops  - In everyday usage, a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a savory meal. The term \\"vegetable\\" is somewhat arbitrary, and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition. It normally excludes other food derived from plants such as fruits, nuts, and cereal grains, but includes seeds such as pulses. The original meaning of the word \\"vegetable\\", still used in biology, was to describe all types of plant, as in the terms \\"vegetable kingdom\\" and \\"vegetable matter\\".  - Downy mildew refers to any of several types of oomycete microbes that are obligate parasites of plants. Downy mildews exclusively belong to Peronosporaceae. In commercial agriculture, they are a particular problem for growers of crucifers, grapes and vegetables that grow on vines. The prime example is \\"Peronospora farinosa\\" featured in NCBI-Taxonomy and HYP3. This pathogen does not produce survival structures in the northern states of the United States, and overwinters as live mildew colonies in Gulf Coast states. It progresses northward with cucurbit production each spring. Yield loss associated with downy mildew is most likely related to soft rots that occur after plant canopies collapse and sunburn occurs on fruit. Cucurbit downy mildew only affects leaves of cucurbit plants.  - Peronosporaceae are a family of water moulds that contains 17 genera, comprising more than 600 species. Most of them are called downy mildews. The closest relative of Peronosporaceae is \\"Phytophthora\\".  - Oomycota or oomycetes form a distinct phylogenetic lineage of fungus-like eukaryotic microorganisms. They are filamentous, microscopic, absorptive organisms that reproduce both sexually and asexually. Oomycetes occupy both saprophytic and pathogenic lifestyles, and include some of the most notorious pathogens of plants, causing devastating diseases such as late blight of potato and sudden oak death. One oomycete, the mycoparasite \\"Pythium oligandrum\\", is used for biocontrol, attacking plant pathogenic fungi. The oomycetes are also often referred to as water molds (or water moulds), although the water-preferring nature which led to that name is not true of most species, which are terrestrial pathogens. The Oomycota have a very sparse fossil record. A possible oomycete has been described from Cretaceous amber.  - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.  - Peronospora farinosa is a plant pathogen. It causes downy mildew on leaves of wild and cultivated \\"Amaranthaceae\\": \\"Amaranthus\\", \\"Atriplex\\", \\"Bassia\\", \\"Beta\\", \\"Chenopodium\\", \\"Halimione\\", \\"Salsola\\", \\"Spinacia\\", etc. In the past, the forms of \\"Peronospora\\" on these different genera, and their species, were given different species names, but these downy mildews are now generally considered to be forms of one species \\"P. farinosa\\" (see \\"Index Fungorum\\"). Some of the forms on important crop plants have been given names as \\"formae speciales\\", notably \\"f.sp. betae\\" on sugar beet (= \\"P. schachtii\\") and f.sp. \\"spinaciae\\" on spinach. Such host specialization possibly also exists with respect to the various wild amaranthaceous hosts of \\"P. farinosa\\".

Given the question \\"What will happen to Others?\\", is \\"make the man grateful for saving his life\\" a valid answer?","output":"The question \\"What will happen to Others?\\" is a vague and broad question that can encompass various aspects and interpretations. It seems to ask about the consequences or outcomes that might happen to other people in a given situation or context. In this case, the context provided is Alex helping a man who is laying on the beach gasping for air. To better evaluate if the answer \\"make the man grateful for saving his life\\" is valid for the original question, we should break down the question and the answer separately: 1. The Situation: Alex helped a man who was laying on the beach gasping for air. This situation implies that the man was in some form of distress, possibly requiring medical attention. Alex's assistance may have been life-saving or considerably beneficial to the man's well-being. 2. The Question: What will happen to Others? Since we have the context of Alex's actions in saving the man's life, we can assume the question is asking about the ripple effects or consequences of Alex's actions or the situation itself on other people who may be involved or impacted by the scenario. 3. The Answer: Make the man grateful for saving his life. The proposed answer, \\"make the man grateful for saving his life,\\" seems to address the impact of the situation on the man directly involved. Gratitude is a reasonable and likely outcome for someone who has just been helped or saved in a significant way. However, this answer does not entirely address the original question, \\"What will happen to Others?\\". It correctly identifies a possible emotion or state for the man who was saved, but it doesn't explore the effect of the situation on other people, as the question implies. For example, how would the people witnessing the event be affected? Would the event inspire others to learn life-saving techniques or foster a sense of community? How would the man's friends and family be impacted by the situation? A more valid answer for the question \\"What will happen to Others?\\" would encompass a broader range of effects on different people who may be affected by the event. For instance, a potential answer could be: \\"Others might be impacted in various ways, such as feeling relief or happiness that the man was saved, developing a stronger sense of community and empathy, and possibly being inspired to learn life-saving techniques or invest in devices that could assist in similar situations.\\" In summary, while the answer \\"make the man grateful for saving his life\\" is relevant in terms of describing the emotions of the man who was saved, it is not a comprehensive response to the question \\"What will happen to Others?\\" as it only addresses one individual instead of exploring broader implications and potential consequences for different people who may be involved or impacted by the situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Assess the remaining options: We are left with two possible choices - corner and wall. Let us evaluate the suitability of each option. 4. Consider functionality: A shelf is typically used for storage and display purposes, and it is essential for it to be accessible and convenient to use. 5. Compare corner and wall: A corner shelf would provide storage in an often underutilized space, maximizing the room's overall functionality. On the other hand, a wall shelf relies on the availability of free wall space for installation. Both options serve the purpose of adding storage and display areas. 6. Analyze the specific needs of the room: If the room is small or has limited wall space, it might be more beneficial to make use of a corner shelf. In a larger room with more available wall space, a wall shelf could also be useful. 7. Select the answer: In this case, the rationale to choose \\"corner\\" as the answer could be that a corner shelf utilizes an often overlooked space in a room, thus increasing storage and display potential without relying on availability of wall space. However, it is important to note that, depending on the room and user's preference, either \\"corner\\" or \\"wall\\" could be viable options for shelf placement.

Read this and answer the question The typical image of migration is of northern landbirds, such as swallows (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics. However, many Holarctic wildfowl and finch (Fringillidae) species winter in the North Temperate Zone, in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the dark-eyed junco Junco hyemalis migrates from subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American goldfinch from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents. Some ducks, such as the garganey Anas querquedula, move completely or partially into the tropics. The European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.

The prime minister, soon after taking the job in September last year, told Family First's Bob Day that he would look at the matter early in 2016 after asking the senator to delay a vote on his private bill, The Australian reported on Friday. When quizzed about his position on the need to change Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, Mr Turnbull told Neil Mitchell on 3AW radio: \\"It depends how you amend it.\\" Momentum is gathering inside the government for a change to Section 18C which makes it illegal to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate someone because of their race. Liberal backbencher Cory Bernardi plans to introduce a bill in the first week of the new parliament that seeks to remove the words \\"offend\\" and \\"insult\\" from the act. Coalition supporters of the change believe they are within one or two votes of securing a Senate majority on the issue. But Mr Turnbull insists changing the act is not a priority for the government. \\"My job is to keep an eye on the key objectives,\\" he said.

After December 27, 2020 the comet would leave the inner solar system. Like many other enthusiasts Ken bought a telescope for the event. His friend Mike is interested in that event too, but is too busy to buy a telescope.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would Neil's Comet be visible or not visible on December 21, 2020?  Hint: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.

Anglicans agree that these stories are nice and connected to what they know about Mary from the Bible and old family memories (ancient traditions).  But, Anglicans are not sure if these special stories about Mary should be considered as important rules or messages given by God, like the rules of a game, which everyone must follow (matters of faith).

Summarize this article: 275 °F (135 °C) is an average temperature for long, slow roasting. You may adjust the temperature, but don't go below 200 °F (93 °C). Use higher temperatures to cut down on cooking time.  City ham is what's commonly sold in supermarkets. They're often pre-cooked, so they won't need to spend as much time in the oven as uncooked hams. Spiral-sliced ham is basically a pre-cut type of city ham. It's also pre-cooked. The labeling on the packaging will tell you what kind of ham you have so you know how to heat it. Uncooked city hams exist, but are harder to find. They'll need to cook a bit longer than pre-cooked ham. Try to keep the side thicker with white-colored fat facing upwards. You may need to cut off a little bit of fat off the bottom to get the ham to lay flat. Leave most of it until later. When roasting half a ham, place the cut side on the pan. Baking sheets, broiler pans, and casserole dishes may also be used. Keep in mind that pans with elevated sides are better than flatter pans. Hold the ham flat and, using your chef's knife, begin scoring lines into the fat. Cut lines across the ham, then cut more down the ham's length. The pattern looks similar to a checkerboard. If there's a lot of fat, you can slice off some of it. Leave a thin layer about 1⁄4 in (6.4 mm) thick. Avoid cutting into the meat. Fill the bottom of the pan with 1 cup (240 mL) of water. If your pan doesn't have high sides, you'll need to check the pan as it cooks and replace the water as needed. The steam provides extra heat and protects the pan from burns. If you choose to cook the ham uncovered in the next step, you'll only need 1⁄4 in (6.4 mm) of water. Place a sheet of foil all the way over the pan. Wrap it tight around the pan's edges so it forms a tent over the ham. Using foil is optional, but it'll lead to a juicier, tastier ham.  Alternatively, wrap the ham directly in foil or place it in a cooking bag. Include the water inside the foil or bag. You may also leave the ham uncovered and cook with less water. 2 hours is an average amount of time to wait before checking the ham's temperature. The specific amount of time will depend on the size of your ham. Estimate it'll take about 20 minutes per 1 lb (0.45 kg) of meat for an uncooked or partially-cooked ham and 15 minutes or less per pound for a fully-cooked ham.  Bone-in hams have a little less meat than boneless hams, so adjust the timing as needed. If you're planning on glazing the ham, it's a good idea to make the glaze while the ham's cooking. Pull out the ham after 2 hours and unwrap the foil. Push the end of the thermometer into the thickest part of the ham. The temperature should read about 120 °F (49 °C). If it isn't, rewrap the foil and continue cooking. Remove the ham when it reaches the proper temperature. When using a liquid glaze, use a pastry brush to coat the outside of the ham. For dry glazes, carefully pat the glaze on by hand. The score marks you made will hold the glaze in place. Generally, the glaze should be added within the last 30 minutes of cooking time. You can also pull the ham out halfway through the cooking time to reapply the glaze. Put the ham back into the oven. After 20 minutes, the glaze will have finished cooking. Pull out the ham and test it again with the thermometer. Look for an internal temperature of 135 °F (57 °C) and continue roasting as needed to reach this temperature. If you used a cooking bag, you should skip this and let the ham rest for 15 minutes. If you need to glaze it and continue cooking, you can use a roasting pan. During these 15 minutes, the inside of the ham continues to cook. It also causes the ham to hold onto juices, preventing it from drying out. After the 15 minutes are up, slice the ham and serve it. Summary:","output":"To cook a ham, set your oven to 275°F (135°C) for long, slow roasting. City hams are usually pre-cooked and found in supermarkets. Spiral-sliced hams are also pre-cooked and pre-cut. If you have an uncooked city ham, it needs more time in the oven.

The given premise states that The Nation's cover story recommends a bank holiday, similar to the one implemented by Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, as a means to prevent further disaster in the global economy. Step 2: Gathering historical evidence. To evaluate the hypothesis's accuracy, we must gather historical data on the impact of FDR's bank holiday on the economy. This will shed light on the potential outcomes of implementing a similar strategy in the current financial situation. Step 3: Evaluating the causality. After obtaining historical evidence, the relationship between the variables 'bank holiday' and 'stock market crash' must be examined in-depth. An in-depth analysis will determine if the bank holiday did indeed have a direct impact on preventing a market crash, or if other factors were at play. Step 4: Comparing the historical and present context. The context surrounding the modern economic state and the historical context of FDR's bank holiday should be compared to determine if a similar intervention would yield the same outcome. Factors such as market structures, regulatory environment, global economy, and financial instruments should be considered. Step 5: Establishing the likelihood. By combining the evidence from historical data and the comparison of contexts, we can calculate the likelihood of a bank holiday's effectiveness in preventing a stock market crash within the current economic environment. While the premise of the cover story proposes that a bank holiday could potentially prevent further catastrophe in the global economy, it's important to go through the steps above to evaluate and substantiate the hypothesis. It's not possible to directly conclude that the hypothesis is true without completing these steps and analyzing the factors involved thoroughly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dion promises more support for arts A Liberal government would reverse the Conservative cuts to arts funding and boost support for cultural industries, Liberal Leader StÃ©phane Dion said Saturday in Montreal. The Liberal arts and culture plan would be worth 533 million over four years, he said. \\"The return on investment [in culture] is phenomenal,\\" he said. Dion also said the Conservatives would attack the CBC, citing a question the party posed in a letter sent as part of the Conservatives' fundraising campaign. The letter was released by the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, a lobby group. The group said the letter asked: \\"The CBC costs taxpayers over 1.1 billion per year. Do you think this is a good use of taxpayers' dollars or a bad use of taxpayers' dollars?\\" Dion said the fact the Conservatives posed such a question indicated they had \\"something in mind.\\" He said the CBC and its French arm, Radio-Canada, are important institutions in a market dominated by U.S. culture. Earlier in the day, Dion said the election represents \\"a choice between gimmicks and a vision.\\" The Conservatives are offering gimmicks and the Liberals a coherent plan, he told voters in Alexandria, Ont., where he was campaigning in the riding of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. Dion used the vision comment to promote his Green Shift plan, intended to cut pollution by increasing taxes on energy consumption but reducing income taxes by the same amount to offset the increase. The Conservatives have attacked the plan, but Dion insisted the concept is simple. \\"Cut income taxes. Shift to pollution,\\" he said. Dion appeared to back away from the Green Shift Friday, when he told reporters the plan was never central to the party's election campaign.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? Paris (CNN) -- Paris is home to tens of thousands of Africans who have added the tastes, sounds and look of home to the city's cultural mix. The majority come from the Francophone North African countries of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, but there are also communities from Mali, Congo, Guinea, Senegal, Burkina Faso and across the continent. According to the 2009 census, the 1.9 million population of Paris includes 30,000 with Algerian nationality, 21,000 Moroccans, 15,000 Tunisians and 54,000 with other African nationalities. There are also many people who were born in Africa and now have French nationality, and French nationals with African-born parents. Many other Africans live in Paris without documentation and do not appear on official records. \\"In those years, you could find plenty of Moroccan and Tunisian specialties because many tourists were going there on vacation and then coming back to France, but OPTIONS: - Africa dishes were much harder to find.\\" - African dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Africans dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Algeria dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Algerian dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Burkina Faso dishes were much harder to find.\\" - CNN dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Congo dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Francophone dishes were much harder to find.\\" - French dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Guinea dishes were much harder to find.\\" - La Goutte d'Or dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Mali dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Moroccans dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Morocco dishes were much harder to find.\\" - North African dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Paris dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Samira Fahim dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Senegal dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Tunisia dishes were much harder to find.\\" - Tunisians dishes were much harder to find.\\"","output":"African dishes were much harder to find. This answer is correct because the passage talks about the African communities and their cultural influences in Paris. The passage mentions tourists coming back from Morocco and Tunisia, so the statement is saying that while Moroccan and Tunisian food was easier to find, broader African cuisine was more difficult to discover in the city. All the other options are wrong because they either mention specific nationalities or countries, which doesn't fit the broader context of the passage, or they mention completely unrelated terms like \\"CNN dishes\\" or \\"Samira Fahim dishes\\" which are not connected to the passage at all. And \\"French dishes\\" option is wrong since it is talking about Paris, which is in France, so it wouldn't make sense for French dishes to be harder to find there."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trim your cat's claws\\" Article:","output":"Title: Protecting Your Furniture from Cat Scratches: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction Cats are lovable companions that bring warmth and joy to our homes. Yet, this often comes with the occasional downside of cats scratching furniture. As much as we adore our feline friends, it can be disheartening to see our favorite furniture pieces with shredded upholstery or claw marks on them. But worry not, for there are ways that can help you protect your furniture and discourage your cat from scratching. In this in-depth article, we will explore four practical methods to prevent your beloved feline from damaging your precious furniture. 1. Use Furniture Covers Covering up your must-protect furniture with high-quality, removable furniture covers is an excellent first-line defense against cat scratches. Not only do these covers conceal your furniture's natural texture, making it less appealing to your feline friend, but they also provide an extra layer of protection to absorb or block those relentless cat claw marks. Choose furniture covers that are durable, washable, and have a snug fit. Opt for materials that are unappealing to cats, such as microfiber or tightly woven fabrics, which often make it difficult for them to sink their claws into. Plus, having washable covers will help remove any cat hair and allergens that may accumulate over time. 2. Spray a Scent Deterrent on the Furniture Cats have an acute sense of smell, and using scents they dislike can be a useful tool in discouraging them from scratching. Find scent deterrent sprays specifically formulated to repel cats from certain areas. Natural and non-toxic spray options are usually citrus-based, as cats generally avoid these smells. Before spraying your furniture, perform a patch test on a hidden area to ensure the spray doesn't cause discoloration or damage to the fabric. If the test is successful, spray the scent deterrent on the spots your cat is most likely to scratch. Reapply as needed for continuous protection. 3. Lay Double-Sided Tape on the Furniture Cats are tactile creatures with sensitive paws. They dislike having sticky sensations on their feet, so using double-sided tape on select furniture areas can be a practical scratch deterrent. By laying strips of double-sided tape on your furniture edges and other cat scratch-prone spots, you create an uncomfortable experience for your feline companion when they attempt to scratch. Several brands offer double-sided tapes specifically designed for this purpose, but any generic double-sided tape will work too. Keep in mind to replace the tape frequently, as it may lose its stickiness or become covered in cat hair and dust over time. 4. Trim Your Cat's Claws Regularly trimming your cat's claws helps keep them blunt, which consequently reduces the potential for damage to your furniture. Although clipped nails will still have some scratching power, the impact on your furniture will be significantly reduced compared to sharp claws. Get your cat accustomed to claw trimming by gently massaging its paws and introducing the clippers over time. Aim to trim your cat's nails every 2-4 weeks, being cautious to avoid cutting the quick of the nail, which contains blood vessels and nerves. Alternatively, you may prefer to enlist the help of a professional groomer or a veterinarian. Conclusion Dealing with cat scratches on furniture can be a frustrating experience for cat owners. With the help of furniture covers, scent deterrents, double-sided tape, and regular claw trimming, however, you can mitigate the risk of damage caused by your cat's natural scratching behavior. These methods not only enhance the longevity of your furniture investments, but they also create a harmonious living environment for you and your feline friend. So put these scratch prevention techniques to work and enjoy the company of your cat, without the worry or hassle of ruined furniture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve for \\"o\\" in this equation, the first step is to simplify the equation on both sides by adding or subtracting terms separately. The equation is: -138*o - 951 + 447 = 1545 + 849 Combine like terms: -138*o - 504 = 2394 Next, let's try to isolate \\"o\\". You should first get rid of the -504 in the left-hand side. You can do this by adding 504 to both sides of the equation: -138*o = 2394 + 504 This simplifies to: -138*o = 2898 You still have -138 multiplying \\"o\\", and you need \\"o\\" to be on its own. Therefore, you're going to have to get rid of the multiplication by doing the opposite operation, division. Divide both sides by -138: o = 2898 / -138 If you divide 2898 by -138 using a calculator, you will obtain approximately: o = -21 Therefore, the solution to the equation -138*o - 951 + 447 = 1545 + 849 for o is approximately -21."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Who was the architect for a visitor attraction in Belfast with more than 12000 sqm of floor space? The answer is:","output":"The architect responsible for designing a visitor attraction in Belfast with more than 12,000 sqm of floor space is Eric Kuhne of the international architectural firm CivicArts / Eric R. Kuhne and Associates. The specific visitor attraction referred to is the Titanic Belfast.  Opened in March 2012, the Titanic Belfast is an iconic landmark that pays tribute to Belfast's rich maritime history and, more specifically, to the RMS Titanic, which was built in Harland and Wolff shipyards in Belfast from 1909 to 1911. Located on the banks of the River Lagan, adjacent to the shipyard where the ill-fated ship was constructed, the Titanic Belfast is a museum and educational facility that chronicles the story of the Titanic, from its conception to its maiden voyage and subsequent tragic sinking. The building itself is a marvel of architectural innovation. Eric Kuhne designed the Titanic Belfast to be a physical representation of the ship and to reflect the city's industrial heritage. The structure encompasses over 12,000 sqm of floor space, which is spread over six floors and accommodates nine interactive galleries, as well as private event spaces, a 1,000-seat banqueting suite, and dedicated education facilities. The exterior of the building consists of 3,000 aluminium plates, evoking the image of the ship's hull, and it stands at 126 feet (38.5 meters) tall, the same height as the original Titanic. The architectural design concept integrates elements from Belfast's industrial past with cutting-edge technology and sustainable practices. The façade's geometric patterns are inspired by the city's shipbuilding and linen industries, while the building's angular form is a tribute to the work of numerous shipwrights, engineers, and artisans who contributed to the construction of the Titanic. In its relatively short existence, the Titanic Belfast has garnered numerous accolades and awards, including the title of the World's Leading Tourist Attraction at the World Travel Awards in 2016, as well as several architectural and design awards. It has also attracted millions of visitors from around the world, playing a significant role in revitalizing the city's tourism industry and solidifying Belfast's position as a globally renowned city of historical and cultural significance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although film, TV and games are garnering more attention each year, visitors who attend Comic-Con to meet their favorite comic-book and graphic-novel creators are usually never disappointed. Nearly every writer and artist from almost every publishing house has a day and time for panel discussions, signings, sketches or simple meet-and-greets. The usual suspects —DC Comics and Marvel — take up most floor space with their expansive and elaborate booths. It's not hard to tell which character or title each of the \\"biggies\\" is pushing for a particular year. For 2010, it's Green Lantern and Thor. What's not always as easy to see is what's happening at some of the smaller publishers. USA TODAY visited three of these booths on Saturday to learn more about some exciting projects that have just been, or will soon be, released. Radical CEO Barry Levine has an eye for developing properties into films. For this year's Comic-Con, the publisher's focus has been on the newly minted partnership with Full Clip Productions, the company co-founded by Avatar star Sam Worthington. The first properties that are tied to this partnership —Damaged and The Last Days of American Crime— are headed into pre-production as films. Radical also is promoting the comic-book miniseries After Dark, co-created by Wesley Snipes and director Antoine Fuqua. The Image Comics booth draws a crowd. The creator-owned company that brought Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead to life (which is subsequently launching as an AMC television series this fall) has a knack for latching onto quirky properties. One such title is John Layman and Rob Guillory's Chew. The incredibly fun series, about a federal agent who can see the memories of anything — or anyone — that he eats, is going to be getting a lot of attention in the months to come. The two creators are being followed around the conference by Morgan Spurlock's film crew. The filmmaker (Super Size Me) is shooting a documentary about Comic-Con this year. Chew also is being developed into a TV or film property. Details haven't been released. Several projects are being hyped by IDW at this year's Con. The official True Blood comic-book series adaptation is first and foremost. These books (and T-shirts) are a popular score for attendees. Aside from TB, the publisher is getting ready to launch a four-issue miniseries based on Dave Stevens' legendary Rocketeer that will feature contributions from a who's who of comic-book royalty. Darwyn Cooke, Bill Willingham, Mike Allred, Alex Ross and Kurt Busiek will participate in the new series. IDW also is relaunching comic-book pioneer John Byrne's Next Men series, a cult favorite among genre fans. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Just as the gavel went down on the £1.04m sale of one of the artist's most famous works, it was shredded by a hidden mechanism inside the picture frame.      The auction house Sotheby's denied any knowledge of the fate of the artwork and said it had \\"been Banksy'd\\".      Image: The mystery man filming the moment the artwork was shredded. Pic: iknowaguy.gallery      Later, the artist posted a video to his Instagram showing how he had secretly built a shredder inside the frame without the dealer or buyer knowing.      A post with the video said: \\"A few years ago, I secretly built a shredder into a painting... in case it was ever put up for auction.\\"      0:10 Video: Moment Banksy artwork shreds itself      The artist's identity is a closely guarded secret but footage from inside the auction house has got reporters talking about the role played by a mystery man in the crowd.      As far as we know, there is only one piece of video footage of the moment of shredding, which was the footage in the \\"official\\" stunt video.      By comparing this \\"official\\" video with other pictures and videos from inside the room, it appears that the person who filmed for Banksy is clear to see.      Image: Banksy's Girl With Red Balloon was ripped to shreds. Pic: Sotheby's      We have also seen still images - spotted by Robert Casterline of the US gallery Casterline Goodman - that further point to the mystery man's camera footage being the same footage that appears on Banksy's Instagram.      The other mysterious thing about the man in question is that he appears to be wearing tinted yellow spectacles with a built-in camera.      You can buy very similar glasses advertised as \\"spy glasses\\" with \\"full HD camera\\" for just £29.99 online.      All of this is of course speculation but when it comes to Banksy, let's face it, everything is. ||||| We've all seen it now, thanks to events in London at the famous auction house Sotheby's, where a print by anonymous Bristolian graffiti artist Banksy has just been sold for close to £1m.      Suddenly, as soon as the sale was confirmed, a remotely activated hidden shredder in the bottom of the picture frame turned on and the painting that had just been bought for a huge sum slowly shredded, emerging in pieces through the bottom of the frame.      Hilarious stuff - a very clever little dig towards the art community at how huge amounts of money change hand for something as essentially useless as a print of a girl holding a balloon.      However, could it have been a bit too clever for the artist's own good?      Firstly, is everyone supposed to believe the piece wasn't checked by experts and appraisers beforehand? Is this not the kind of thing that they might have spotted? Surely a shredder in the bottom of the frame must be a bit heavy.      That probably means that Sotheby's is completely in on the joke, which changes the nature of the statement being made entirely.      Secondly, in creating the scene and the stir around the picture, it's now probably actually worth more than it was. That can't have been the point either, can it? Actually, that's pretty likely.      Which brings us to the real issue.      In performing the stunt, Banksy might have revealed his identity to the world, after years of trying desperately to hide it. I mean, graffiti is - broadly speaking - illegal, after all.      So, for those not familiar with the battle to 'out' Banksy's real identity, there are a few candidates.      A name that keeps cropping up repeatedly is Robin Gunningham. He's a street artist from Bristol - so far, so plausible.            Robin Gunningham, or Banksy? Credit: origin unknown            Naturally, he's denied all allegations and refuted claims that have been floating around since about 2008.      Now, straight after the stunt at Sotheby's, there was a video posted online that showed the moment the shredder kicked in.      In the foreground at one point is a person taking a photo on their phone who matches exactly the description and features of one Robin Gunningham, no less. That photo appears to be from exactly the same vantage point as one that was later posted on Banksy's Instagram with the caption: \\"Going, going, gone...\\"      Coincidence? You be the judge.      The man in the video is here.            Credit: Sotheby's            Here is the photo from Instagram.            Credit: Instagram/Banksy            Well?      Obviously, it's not conclusive proof by any stretch of the imagination, but it's good enough for people online to start wondering about it.            Credit: Twitter            Other suspects include Massive Attack musician Robert Del Naja. He's also a graffiti artist and from Bristol. Don't worry, loads of people think they've seen him there yesterday too and saw him leave quickly.      In case the real Banksy is reading this, nobody has a fucking clue still, really.

In Greek mythology, the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans (Greeks) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably Homer's Iliad. The core of the Iliad (Books II -- XXIII) describes a period of four days and two nights in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the war's heroes. Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments. Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid.

In 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his titular church or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.[citation needed]  The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church, or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin cardo (hinge), meaning \\"principal\\" or \\"chief\\". The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the tituli (parishes) of the diocese of Rome. The Church of England retains an instance of this origin of the title, which is held by the two senior members of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul's Cathedral. 1.

The Pope is elected by the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees. 3. Some other titles in the religion include cardinal, bishops, priests, and minor canons. 4. If you're asking about the title 'cardinal', no, it's not related to the bird. They just share the same name. 5. The term 'cardinal' comes from the Latin word 'cardo', which means 'hinge', 'principal', or 'chief'. It is used to indicate the important role of these individuals in the church. 6. The term 'cardinal' in this context came into use around the ninth century. 7. No, individuals from outside Rome can also become cardinals. They don't necessarily have to be Roman residents. 8. No, initially only the clergy from Rome had this privilege, but it was not always the case. 9. The rule changed in the 12th century when the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began. 10. When ecclesiastics from outside of Rome began to be appointed as cardinals, they were assigned a church in Rome as their titular church or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses. So yes, they had added responsibilities. 11. They were assigned one church in Rome or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses. However, they were still incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome. This suggests that they might have connections with more than one church."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Jewel of the Nile Movie plot: This sequel to 1984's rip-snorting romantic-adventure, Romancing the Stone, is a moderately entertaining tale that pales by comparison to its predecessor.

Let's talk about five easy ways to keep your things safe and avoid naughty people who might try to take them when you're on vacation. You know, vacations are fun times when you travel somewhere with your family to enjoy and explore new places. But sometimes, bad people called \\"thieves\\" try to steal things from you. So, here are five simple things you can do to stop them! 1. Be a Backpack Buddy: Always use a backpack or a bag with zippers when you go out to play or explore places on your vacation. Zippers are like little superheroes that help you lock your bag and keep your stuff safe inside. Make sure to close all the zippers, and keep your backpack close to you or ask your mommy or daddy to hold it for you. 2. Hide-and-Seek with Your Valuables: Keep your money, toys, and other important things hidden in secret spots inside your bag, like small pockets or pouches. This can make it harder for the sneaky thieves to find and steal them. You can also ask your parents to keep some of your things in their bags for double protection. 3. Always Stay with Your Family: Vacations are more fun when you're with your family. Make sure to always stay close to your mommy, daddy, or any grown-up you trust. They will help keep you and your things safe from any bad people. Don't wander off alone or talk to strangers who might want to take your things. 4. Lock Your Room and Your Suitcase: When you're staying at a hotel or someone else's house, always lock your room and your suitcase to keep your things safe. You can ask your parents to help you lock them, like putting a big superhero shield around your stuff. And remember, don't open the door to strangers or let people you don't know into your room. 5. Be Aware and Be a Good Listener: Always keep your eyes and ears open when you're on vacation. Listen to your parents or grown-ups when they tell you about places that might not be safe. Be mindful of people around you and don't leave your things unattended. Being aware and listening to your parents can help you be a safety superhero for your family! Well, that's it, little friends! Follow these five tips, and you'll have lots of fun on your vacation without having to worry about anyone stealing your stuff.

Q:What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat - A:","output":"A: The missing first step in the process appears to be a destructive event, such as a forest fire or widespread deforestation, that triggers the subsequent chain of effects on the ecosystem. The complete process would likely look like this: 1. A forest fire or widespread deforestation occurs - This is the initial event that sets off the rest of the process. Forest fires can be caused by natural factors such as lightning strikes or human activities like uncontrolled agricultural burning, arson, or accidental ignitions. Deforestation, on the other hand, is primarily driven by human activities, such as logging or conversion of forests to agricultural land. 2. The trees and plants burn - The fire or deforestation results in the loss of trees and plants, crucial elements of the ecosystem. As they burn or are removed, various species lose their habitats and sources of food. 3. The animals lose their homes - With the destruction of trees and plants, many animals also lose their habitats. For arboreal or tree-dwelling species, this can have particularly immediate and severe consequences. 4. If the animals cannot escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The smoke generated from the fires can lead to choking, respiratory distress, and death for the animals, especially those unable to escape due to weakened health, limited mobility, or environmental obstructions. 5. The plants that provide food are gone - As the fire or deforestation destroys the plants, it also eliminates a vital food source for herbivorous animals within the ecosystem. This lack of food can cause starvation, population decline, or forced migration in search of sustenance. 6. The animals have little to eat - With the plants gone and the ecosystem disrupted, animals may struggle to find food, water, or even suitable shelter. This lack of resources can lead to increased competition and conflict among species, as well as a greater vulnerability to predators or other threats. In summary, the missing first step in this process is a destructive event such as a forest fire or widespread deforestation, which initiates a series of negative impacts on the ecosystem including habitat loss, reduced biodiversity, and disruption of the food chain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Health issues on the long run, while important to consider, would not have a direct correlation or effect on magma behavior, specifically in terms of temperature decrease and cooling. However, there could be a slightly less effect on the magma behavior due to the reduced human activities in the surrounding area, as there could be lesser mining or exploration activities in the region as a result of the health issues. This reduction in human intervention might allow the natural cooling process to be less disturbed.

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, who previously said the arrival of security guard Jesus Campos may have caused Paddock to stop firing on the festival audience, now says Campos was investigating a report of an open door on the 32nd floor when he heard drilling sounds coming from Paddock's room, the AP reports. The sheriff says Paddock had installed hidden cameras and started firing into the hallway when he saw Campos approaching. Campos was hit in the leg but was still able to alert security officials to Paddock's location, Lombardo says. He says that Paddock started firing on the crowd about six minutes after shooting the guard and never completed his drilling, which may have been to install more cameras or create a hole to shoot through. The sheriff didn't explain why such a big change was made to the timeline or say how it could affect the investigation, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. \\"In your zest for information and my zest to ensure the public safety and the calming of their minds, some things are going to change,\\" he said. (Lombardo released more new details Monday, but said police still don't know what Paddock's motive was.)","output":"Title: Major Changes in Timeline of Las Vegas Shooting Unveiled by Clark County Sheriff Introduction On October 1, 2017, America was shaken by the deadliest mass shooting in its modern history. The assailant, Stephen Paddock, opened fire at a crowd in the Route 91 Harvest music festival near the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas, leaving at least 58 dead and hundreds injured. As the investigation continues, new information surfaces, altering our understanding of the event. This article will delve into the major changes in the timeline of the Las Vegas shooting incident, based on the statements of the Clark County Sheriff, Joe Lombardo. The chronological change and its implications The most significant change in the course of events involves the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, injured by Paddock. Previously, it was believed that Paddock ceased fire on the festival crowd following Campos' arrival on the assailant's floor. However, Sheriff Joe Lombardo now says Campos was shot before Paddock began firing at the festival crowd. According to Lombardo, Campos was investigating a report of an open door on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel when he heard drilling sounds coming from Paddock's room. Upon realizing that Campos was approaching, Paddock opened fire into the hallway, hitting Campos in the leg. Despite being injured, Campos alerted security officials to the shooter's location. The sheriff added that Paddock started firing on the crowd about six minutes after shooting Campos. Paddock never completed his drilling, which may have been meant to install additional cameras or provide access for more gunfire. This change in the timeline raises new questions about law enforcement's response to the incident and the subsequent investigation. The sheriff did not provide an explanation for why this alteration was made to the timeline and did not comment on its effects on the ongoing investigation, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Sheriff Lombardo said, \\"In your zest for information and my zest to ensure the public safety and the calming of their minds, some things are going to change.\\" Paddock's surveillance efforts and motive Sheriff Lombardo disclosed that Paddock had installed hidden cameras in the hotel room, suggesting he carefully planned and prepared for the attack. These cameras may have helped Paddock watch for approaching security threats, such as Campos. As of now, law enforcement officials have not been able to identify Paddock's motive for the shooting. Conclusion As the investigation into the Las Vegas shooting continues, new revelations like the ones from Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo will alter our perception of the horrific event. With many questions still unanswered, including the motive and law enforcement's response, the public eagerly awaits further information to piece together the complete picture of the fateful night. It is important to remember, however, that the investigation process may be fluid and susceptible to changes in an attempt to establish a thorough understanding of the events that transpired."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result of the group line-up change, \\"Sweet 7\\" was re-recorded to feature the vocals of new member Ewen and for the removal of former member Buchanan's vocals. As a result, this is the only album that features none of the original members.  - London Records is a record label in the U.K. that marketed records in the U.S, Canada, and Latin America from 1947 to 1979 before becoming semi-independent.  - Jade Louise Ewen (born 24 January 1988) is an English singer, songwriter, actress and a former member of the band Sugababes. Ewen began her singing career in a girl group named Trinity Stone, which signed with Sony BMG in 2005 but disbanded in 2007 without releasing an album. In 2009, after winning the right, she represented the United Kingdom in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest by performing the Andrew Lloyd Webber penned \\"It's My Time\\". She finished in fifth place, making her the most successful British Eurovision act since 2002. She is well known for her Connie Francis-like vocals.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - \`\` Shape '' is a song by English girl group Sugababes , released as the fourth and final single from their second studio album , Angels with Dirty Faces ( 2002 ) .

Together they wrote \\"Shape of My Heart,\\" which would be sampled by various artists, including in hit songs for Craig David and the Sugababes. He has released several solo albums.  - The Sugababes were an English girl group, formed in 1998 with founding members Siobhán Donaghy, Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. Their debut album, \\"One Touch\\", was released in the UK through London Records on 27 November 2000. The album achieved moderate success, peaking at number 26 in April 2001 and eventually being certified Gold. In 2001, Donaghy departed the group amid rumours of a rift with Buchanan and the group were dropped by their record label. With the introduction of Heidi Range, former member of fellow English girl group Atomic Kitten, the group began to experience a higher level of commercial success whilst keeping the critical acclaim they had achieved with their debut album. They released three studio albums before Buena announced her departure in December 2005, leading to Amelle Berrabah being brought in to replace her. Following the release of their first greatest hits album, the new line-up released two studio albums. In September 2009, after 11 years in the Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by former UK Eurovision entry Jade Ewen.

Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (19141978) is often called the \\"Godfather of Doo-wop\\" for his introducing the \\"top and bottom\\" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song.

With the Sugababes, Buchanan had six number one singles and two number one studio albums, making the Sugababes one of the most successful British pop acts of the 21st century. Buchanan was asked to leave the group in September 2009 and was replaced by Jade Ewen.  - \\"Shape of My Heart\\" is a song by American boy band Backstreet Boys.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\" and was probably the first \\"scientifically-equipped laboratory\\" in the United States. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying carbon monoxide (which he called \\"heavy inflammable air\\"). In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter. Built in an 18th-century Georgian style, the \\"balance and symmetry\\" of the architecture signaled \\"subdued elegance\\". The house was accented with Federalist highlights, such as \\"the fanlights over the doors and the balustrades on the rooftop belvedere and main staircase\\", marking it as distinctly American. Douglas R. McMinn, in the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Northumberland Historic District, calls it a \\"mansion\\" that is \\"probably the finest example of the Federal style in the region\\". As William N. Richardson, the site administrator for the Joseph Priestley House in the 1990s, notes, Priestley's American home did not resemble his \\"high-style Georgian town house\\" that was destroyed in Birmingham; rather, it was \\"plain\\" and built in the \\"American vernacular\\".The house has...

New right of review will allow victims to question prosecutors' decisions. Director of Public Prosecutions says victims have only a 'walk-on part' Justice minister Helen Grant said the criminal justice system makes victims' 'already horrific experiences worse' Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: New Right of Review Empowers Victims to Question Prosecutors' Decisions Intro: A groundbreaking amendment to the criminal justice system is set to improve the plight of victims by granting them the ability to question prosecutors' decisions. This comes after a statement by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who claimed that victims have merely a 'walk-on part' in the current system. Justice minister Helen Grant has also highlighted the need for change, arguing that the present state of affairs only aggravates the 'already horrific experiences' faced by victims. Step 1: Explain the New Right of Review The new right of review will allow victims to challenge decisions made by public prosecutors if they believe their case has been dismissed without due consideration. This marks a significant shift in the power dynamics within the criminal justice system, as victims will have a greater say and potentially provide material that could lead to a reconsideration of their case. Step 2: Highlight the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the reform The Director of Public Prosecutions has played an instrumental role in this reform, recognizing that victims often feel sidelined in the legal process. By advocating for their voices to be heard and taken into account more seriously, the Director is pushing for a more inclusive and compassionate legal system that puts the needs of victims at the forefront. Step 3: Quote Justice Minister Helen Grant's concerns about the existing system Helen Grant, the Justice Minister, has voiced her concerns about how the current criminal justice system treats victims and exacerbates their suffering. She has called for much-needed change, endorsing the new right of review as a step towards a more supportive and empathetic legal framework. Step 4: Discuss the potential benefits of the new system The introduction of the right to review comes with several anticipated benefits, including an increased sense of agency and empowerment for victims. By giving them the opportunity to question prosecutors' decisions, this reform may lead to an overall reduction in their feelings of helplessness and disenfranchisement. Moreover, it is expected that this new system will improve transparency in the decision-making process, boosting confidence in the criminal justice system and fostering a more inclusive environment in which the rights and opinions of all parties are respected. Conclusion: The new right of review is a much-needed amendment to the criminal justice system that has the potential to significantly improve the experiences of victims. By giving them the opportunity to question prosecutors' decisions and have their voices heard, it is hoped that this reform will bring forth a more compassionate and inclusive legal landscape where transparency, empathy, and equal treatment are prioritized."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(May 2015) A man is discovered breaking into his own jewellery shop in the dead of night. Questioned closely, it is discovered that his wife is being held hostage at their home by Steve, a brutal extortionist who demands the diamonds in the shop's safe in exchange for the woman's life. After Steve kills the family maid, FBI agent Warren Stantin (Sidney Poitier) hands over the diamonds, but Steve kills the jeweller's wife anyway, and escapes. Feeling that he has failed, Stantin becomes obsessed with finding Steve, and he chases Steve into the rugged forests of the state of Washington, where Steve joins up with a group of sportsmen who plan to trek into the wilderness on a fishing trip. Steve's plan is to kill them and force their guide, Sarah (Kirstie Alley), to lead him through the wilderness to the CanadaâUS border. Stantin must team up with Sarah's mountain-man boyfriend Jonathan Knox (Tom Berenger) to pursue Steve. Jonathan does not believe city slicker Stantin can keep up on a tough cross-country hike that includes some rock climbing, and Stantin is determined to prove himself. They pursue Steve and Sarah into the wilderness and eventually to the streets of Vancouver. The movie also featured a chase scene aboard the BC Ferries Queen of Vancouver. After a long chase, Stantin manages to shoot Steve in an underwater struggle. The killer's identity is not revealed until midway through the film. He attempts to evade detection by killing a member of a hiking expedition and taking his place. To keep the audience guessing as to the true identity of the villain, some of the hikers were played by actors known for playing bad guys: notably Clancy Brown (Highlander), Frederick Coffin (Mother's Day), Andrew Robinson (Dirty Harry) and Richard Masur (the vicious drug dealer in Who'll Stop the Rain).

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Article:","output":"Title: Irish Premiership's Top Two Teams in Tug-of-War over Former York City Defender Josh Robinson Introduction The Irish Premiership, a highly competitive football league, has found itself in the spotlight recently following a unique and bizarre situation. Both of the league's top two teams, Linfield and Crusaders, have publicly claimed to have signed former York City defender, Josh Robinson. The situation has sparked discussions and debates while the football world eagerly awaits for an official confirmation from Josh Robinson himself or a relevant authority. Background Josh Robinson is a Northern Irish professional footballer who played as a central defender at York City from 2016 to 2017. The 28-year-old player left York City and has since been on the radar of several clubs from different leagues. Both Linfield and Crusaders have been in hot pursuit of Robinson since his departure from York City became public. Linfield and Crusaders Linfield and Crusaders are two of the biggest clubs in the Irish Premiership, and they are currently occupying the top two spots in the league table. With the 2021-2022 season coming to an end, both clubs are looking to bolster their squads for the upcoming season. Adding a player of Robinson’s caliber and experience could make a significant difference for either team's chances of clinching the title. The Controversy The controversy began when both Linfield and Crusaders announced on their respective websites and social media channels that they had successfully signed Josh Robinson. Linfield reportedly secured Robinson's signature on a three-year contract, while Crusaders claimed to have signed him on a two-year deal. The bizarre situation has led to major confusion among fans and rivals alike. Potential Consequences The Irish Premiership's governing body and the players' union may need to intervene to resolve the issue if it is not addressed quickly. The primary concern must be to maintain the dignity and fairness of the sport, avoiding any potential conflicts that may arise from this controversy. The clubs involved may face disciplinary actions if it is determined that they engaged in any unethical practices in their attempts to secure Robinson's signature. Furthermore, the player in question might have to face the consequences of signing multiple contracts if it is found that he has indeed committed to both teams. Possible Outcomes One possible outcome is that one of the clubs, either Linfield or Crusaders, would have to admit an error in their announcement, accepting that they have not managed to sign the player. In such a scenario, the club might face an embarrassing situation but would be within the rules of the game. Another possible outcome is that the governing body investigates the case, scrutinizes the documents submitted by both clubs, and delivers a verdict based on the authenticity and legitimacy of the contracts presented. This decision would be binding for both clubs and the player. Conclusion The unusual announcement by both Linfield and Crusaders regarding the signing of Josh Robinson is a peculiar scenario that has caught the attention of the football world. Both clubs must cooperate and provide clarity to the situation as well as show respect to their fans, who are eagerly waiting for an official resolution to the matter. Should this case set a precedent for similar situations in the future, the governing bodies and players' unions must develop stringent rules and guidelines to prevent any potential conflicts and disputes. Until then, all eyes are on the Irish Premiership's top two teams and their most recent acquisition, as the football world waits for an official resolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Felicia, being a first-time homeowner, wasn't familiar with all the tools needed for performing these tasks. Cynthia, a close friend of Felicia and an experienced DIY enthusiast, observed that Felicia had been struggling with sealing gaps and cracks in her new home, particularly around the windows and doors. These gaps were not only affecting the aesthetics of the house, but also leading to energy inefficiency by letting in cold drafts during winter and warm air during summer, causing discomfort for Felicia and her family. Understanding the importance of a caulking gun for such repairs, Cynthia decided to do a favor for her friend and buy the essential tool as a gift. As an experienced DIYer, Cynthia knew that investing in a high-quality caulking gun would make the caulking job easier, more efficient, and result in a professional-looking finish. She took the time to do some research, comparing prices and reading reviews on various caulking guns available at local stores and e-commerce sites. Eventually, she found the perfect caulking gun that had an excellent grip, a smooth trigger mechanism, and a sturdy rod to ensure precise and comfortable usage. Once Cynthia purchased the caulking gun, she returned to Felicia's home with the intention of not only presenting the tool to her friend but also providing a demonstration on its proper usage. Together, the two friends spent the afternoon working on sealing the gaps and cracks in Felicia's home. Cynthia showed Felicia how to load the caulking tube into the gun, how to cut the nozzle at an appropriate angle depending on the size of the gap, and the correct technique to apply steady pressure to the trigger while guiding the tip of the nozzle along the gap for a clean and even seal. By the end of the day, Felicia was well-versed in the art of caulking and expressed her gratitude to Cynthia for her thoughtful gift and invaluable assistance. The caulking gun proved to be not only functional but also a symbolic gesture of friendship, demonstrating Cynthia's willingness to step in and offer support when Felicia needed it most. As the gaps in Felicia's home were sealed and her comfort improved, so too did their bond of friendship grow stronger."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tony Stark has become a champion for world peace thanks to the Iron Man suit, and has practically solved the issue of world peace, or so he claims.Six months after the end of the first movie, Tony Stark has used his Iron Man armor to bring about a negotiated peace treaty between the major super powers of the world, and his immense popularity with the general public is only furthered when he fulfills his father's dream by reopening the \\"Stark Expo\\" in Queens, NY, to showcase all the latest inventions that will benefit the world.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What band has musical influences such as Burt Bacharach? ?  Their records have been heavily influenced by the \\"motorik\\" technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust. Tim Gane has supported the comparison: \\"Neu! did minimalism and drones, but in a very pop way.\\" Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that their music also had \\"echoes of bubblegum, of exotica, of Beach Boys and bossa nova\\", with their earlier work \\"bearing strong Velvet Underground overtones\\". Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were additional inspirations for the band. Stephan Davet of French newspaper Le Monde said that Emperor Tomato Ketchup (1996) had musical influences such as Burt Bacharach, and Françoise Hardy. The sounds influenced by minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich can be found on the 1999 album Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night. The same album, according to Rick Reger of Chicago Tribune, \\"charts [a course] somewhere between the Beach Boys and Kraftwerk.\\" Stereolab's style also incorporates easy-listening music of the 1950s and '60s. Barney Hoskyns wrote in a review for Dots and Loops (1997) that the group moved \\"away from the one-chord Velvets drone-mesh of its early days\\" toward easy-listening and Europop. Joshua Klein in Washington Post said that, \\"Years before everyone else caught on, Stereolab [were] referencing the 1970s German bands Can and Neu!, the Mexican lounge music master Esquivel and the decidedly unhip Burt Bacharach.\\" Regarding their later work such as Instant 0 in the Universe (2003) and Margerine Eclipse (2004), critics have compared the releases to the band's earlier guitar-driven style.

His father, Christopher Cornelius \\"Kit\\" Culkin, is a former actor known for his productions on Broadway and is the brother of actress Bonnie Bedelia. His mother is Patricia Brentrup, who never married Culkin. He was named Macaulay after Thomas Babington Macaulay and Carson after Kit Carson of the Old West. Culkin rose to fame with his lead role of Kevin McCallister in the highly successful blockbuster Christmas film, Home Alone (1990), where he was reunited with Uncle Buck writer and director John Hughes and Uncle Buck co-star John Candy, who played the role of Polka band member, Gus Polinski. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and won an American Comedy Award and a Young Artist Award for his role as Kevin McCallister.  In 1991, Culkin starred in an animated Saturday morning cartoon television series, Wish Kid, hosted Saturday Night Live and starred in Michael Jackson's \\"Black or White\\" music video. He starred as Thomas J. Sennett in the film, My Girl (1991), for which he was nominated for Best On-Screen Duo and won Best Kiss at the MTV Movie Awards, with Anna Chlumsky.  He reprised his role of Kevin McCallister in the sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), for which he was nominated for a Kids' Choice Award. He played the role of Henry in the drama-thriller film, The Good Son (1993), which only did reasonably well (although he was nominated for MTV Movie Award in the category for Best Villain for his performance). He also appeared, while a student at the School of American Ballet, in a filmed version of The Nutcracker as the title role in 1993, which was staged by Peter Martins from the 1954 George Balanchine New York City Ballet version of the work.  He was in the films, Getting Even with Dad (1994), The Pagemaster (1994) and Richie Rich (1994), which were all only mildly successful at the box office.","output":"This text is about Macaulay Carson Culkin, an American actor who rose to fame with his lead role in the film Home Alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - trip - sweating - satisfaction - working out - better health The answer is:","output":"\\"trip.\\"  If you fall while going for a run, it most likely means that you tripped over something. This could be due to various reasons such as uneven ground, a rock or tree root, or even just a misstep. Tripping is a common scenario when one loses their balance while running, causing a fall.  Let's look at the other options for the sake of completion:    - Sweating: It's normal and expected to sweat while running as your body heats up from the exercise. Sweat helps regulate your body's temperature. However, sweating is not directly causing falls. It's true that in some instances excessive sweat could cause your hands to be slippery and potentially cause a dropping of items, but it's not directly attributed to the act of falling while running. - Satisfaction: Satisfaction is an emotional state, more of a result you feel after accomplishing something, like a good run. It has no relation to physically falling while running.  - Working out: Running is indeed a form of working out, and while working out, there can be multiple possibilities of injuries or accidents such as falling. But saying you fell because you were working out is not addressing the direct cause within the activity itself. - Better health: This is an ultimate goal or end result of running regularly, alongside maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Better health is the long-term advantage of routinely working out or running, but it's not a reason for falling while performing the act of running. So, out of the given options, 'trip' is the most suitable as all the others do not describe an incident that would most likely explain why you fell while running. It's important to always ensure safety while running, keeping an eye on the path ahead and potentially wearing protective gear if the terrain mandates."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

The steps are in chronological order, from the mature mushroom releasing spores to the emergence of a new mushroom. After the primordia, which is essentially the initial visible formation of a mushroom, shoots out of the ground, it will grow and mature over several days. Primordia, which begins as small, white, fuzzy protuberances, grows and develops rapidly into a full-grown mushroom. The process involves dramatic cell expansion and division, as well as the transfer of nutrients and water from the mycelium into the developing structure. As the mushroom grows, its cap will gradually open, revealing the gills (in gilled mushrooms) underneath. The cap continues to expand until it's flat or in some species, slightly upturned. This process is dependent on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light, and the availability of nutrients. Finally, in the mature mushroom, the gills are lined with basidia, which are specialized cells where spore production takes place. Each basidium may produce several spores. These spores eventually get released, signifying the mushroom's readiness for reproduction, and the cycle begins anew. So, to answer your question, the final step in this process is that the mature mushroom gives off gills lined with basidia, and these basidia produce and release spores for the propagation of the species. This completes the mushroom's sexual reproduction and the spore-release step closes the cycle. It is simple but elegant, a marvel of nature's design. The mushroom life cycle is an extraordinary sequence of events and this is why mushrooms have been able to colonize almost every habitat on Earth. Only through understanding the steps in the mushroom life cycle, from spore germination to mycelial growth to mushroom formation and spore release, can we truly comprehend the magic of mushrooms and their vital role in our ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who died in 1917?, using the article: Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The first name of the person who died in 1917, as mentioned in the article, is Tom (Tom Thomson)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Roujin Z Context: ROUJIN Z is a classic feature length anime by director Katsuhiro Otomo the creator of AKIRA. Unlike AKIRA, ROUJIN Z is an comedy. An experimental computerized sick bed malfunctions and goes on a rampage through Tokyo with an invalid old man aboard. (Roujin means old man in Japanese.) The out of cotrol atomic powered bed adds other machines to itself and grows to gigantic proportions. (much like Tetsuo's out of control body in AKIRA.) There's plenty of action and laughs with teens in trouble, bumbling bureaucrats and giant fighting robots. The 1998 DVD contains the original version subtitled, and a dubbed English version. Even if you don't like English dubs, watch this one for the extra jokes the scripter added to the film. A:","output":"Roujin Z, a classic feature-length anime directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, who also created Akira, is a comedy that dives into the world of advanced technology and its potential consequences. The central feature of this movie is an experimental, computerized sick bed designed for elderly patients. The primary function of this bed was to assist and take care of its occupant. However, things take an unexpected turn when the bed malfunctions. In the story, an invalid old man boards the bed, and the device starts to go on a rampage through Tokyo. Interestingly, the bed is atomic-powered, which allows it to add other machines to itself as it wreaks havoc across the city. As it accumulates these additional machines, the bed grows to an enormous size, resembling Tetsuo's out-of-control body from Akira. This situation paves the way for action-packed sequences and comedic moments, as various characters get involved in the chaos. These include teenagers finding themselves in trouble, inept bureaucrats struggling to manage the crisis, and even giant fighting robots coming into play to mitigate the damage caused by the rampaging bed. The 1998 DVD release of Roujin Z offers two distinct viewing options: the original version with subtitles and an English-dubbed version. It is noteworthy that the English dubbed version includes additional jokes that were incorporated into the script, making it worth watching even for those who generally prefer the original subtitled presentation. In conclusion, the entity that rampages through Tokyo in the film Roujin Z is an experimental, computerized sick bed designed for elderly care. After a malfunction occurs, the bed embarks on a chaotic journey across the city, growing in size and incorporating other machines, leading to a series of action-packed and humorous encounters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's like playdough that can stick to magnets. For this, you didn't give me any solutions to choose from, but don't worry! I'll help you with a simple way to make magnetic slime.  Here's what you'll need: 1. Glue (the white school glue is perfect) 2. Liquid starch (like the stuff used for clothes) 3. Iron filings (these are tiny bits of iron - ask a grown-up for help to get these) 4. A bowl and a spoon to mix everything 5. A magnet to play with the slime Now, let's make magnetic slime: 1. Pour some glue into the bowl (about 1 cup). 2. Mix in the iron filings (2-3 tablespoons should be enough but the more you add the more it sticks to the magnet). 3. Slowly add liquid starch into the bowl (about 1/2 cup), mixing it together with the glue and iron filings. 4. Keep mixing until the slime starts to form and pull away from the bowl. 5. Use your hands to knead the slime until it's not sticky anymore (you may need a bit more liquid starch if it's still too sticky).  That's it! Now you have your magnetic slime.

Apparently handcuffed by the Tribune's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the Ricketts family, the Cubs' quest for a NL Central 3-peat started with notice that there would be less invested into contracts than in previous years. Chicago engaged St. Louis in a see-saw battle for first place into August 2009, but the Cardinals played to a torrid 20–6 pace that month, designating their rivals to battle in the Wild Card race, from which they were eliminated in the season's final week. The Cubs were plagued by injuries in 2009, and were only able to field their Opening Day starting lineup three times the entire season. Third baseman Aramis Ramírez injured his throwing shoulder in an early May game against the Milwaukee Brewers, sidelining him until early July and forcing journeyman players like Mike Fontenot and Aaron Miles into more prominent roles. Additionally, key players like Derrek Lee (who still managed to hit .306 with 35 HR and 111 RBI that season), Alfonso Soriano and Geovany Soto also nursed nagging injuries. The Cubs posted a winning record (83–78) for the third consecutive season, the first time the club had done so since 1972, and a new era of ownership under the Ricketts' family was approved by MLB owners in early October.

Movie plot: Is everything random \\"or is there a Grand Design?\\" muses Albert Einstein at the opening of the film. And we are left with the ultimate conclusion that where true love is concerned at least, the answer is a resounding \\"Yes\\" to a Grand Design. An easy-going garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), meets Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), a successful Princeton University mathematics doctoral candidate, as she comes into the garage, accompanied by her resistant and critical English fiancÃ©, acerbic experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). There is an immediate \\"electric\\" connection which Ed recognizes, but she is not yet aware. Ed sees his future, briefly, and Catherine is a major part of it; they are married, and have children together. \\"How long will all of this take?\\" asks Catherine, referring to the car repair, and Ed, thinking about their future life together, replies, \\"That's up to you\\". His life purpose has suddenly been decided by a force of nature greater than himself. Finding a watch she left at the garage, Ed travels to her address and finds himself face to face with Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau), who is Catherine's uncle.[1] Albertâportrayed as a fun-loving geniusâand his mischievous friends, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt GÃ¶del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks), see Ed as someone who would be better suited for Catherine. The four of them try to help Ed look and sound like a scientist (i.e., a \\"wunderkind\\" in physics) temporarily, in order to garner Catherine's attention for Ed, while at the same time trying to convince Catherine that life is not all about the mind, but is also about the heart. James's heart is virtually non-existent, while Ed's heart is virtually limitless. Einstein sees bringing Ed and Catherine together as his most enduring legacy to his niece, because she was of the mistaken opinion that her only contribution to the world was to be through her children, and that she therefore must marry a total intellectual because...","output":"her children would then inherit his intellect, thus ensuring future generations of geniuses. She felt that her own abilities were not enough and found it necessary to continue Albert Einstein's legacy by linking with another intellectual. However, the movie I.Q., directed by Fred Schepisi, is a romantic comedy that emphasizes the importance of love, interpersonal connections, and personal happiness over mere intellectual abilities. In the film, Einstein assists Ed in winning Catherine's heart, illustrating that love has the power to connect individuals from vastly different backgrounds and skills, such as a mechanic and a mathematics doctoral candidate. The movie also demonstrates that intelligence is not always measured through academic achievements. Ed's \\"street smarts\\" and natural problem-solving capabilities are the very qualities that impress Einstein and his friends, making them believe that Ed is a better match for Catherine than her well-educated but heartless fiancé, James. This juxtaposition depicts that character and love are far more important in life than people's intellectual abilities alone. As the story progresses, Catherine learns that genuine happiness and personal growth come from love, nurturing relationships, and following one's heart, rather than solely focusing on academic pursuits. Through Ed's unconditional support and love, Catherine realizes her own potential and understands her worth is not limited to the intelligence she can pass onto her children. In the end, the idea of a \\"Grand Design\\" implies that life works in mysterious ways, and some things can't be explained merely by logic or scientific theories. The movie posits that love falls into this category, as it transcends societal expectations, preconceived notions, and individual backgrounds. Love becomes the ultimate expression of connection, truth, and proof of the existence of a higher, divine orchestration. So, in deciding whether to invest in the film proposal, one should consider various factors such as the potential audience, current trends, and the overarching message of the film. The appeal of a romantic comedy like I.Q. often lies in its lighthearted take on complex matters such as love and intellectual compatibility, providing viewers with an entertaining and heartwarming experience. Moreover, the film's exploration of the importance of love, relationships, and personal fulfillment over mere intellectual prowess renders a timeless and universally relatable message. Thus, investing in a film proposal like I.Q. could turn out to be a wise decision, offering entertainment value, cultural relevance, and an opportunity to convey a powerful and resonant message to the audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the producer who provided the studio where the band that rehearsed in a deconsecrated church recorded their first single?  In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of 2 each per day.During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded its first single, \\"Radio Free Europe\\", at producer Mitch Easter's Drive-In...

La Strada (lit. \\"The Road\\") is a 1954 Italian drama film directed by Federico Fellini from his own screenplay co-written with Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano. The film portrays a naive young woman (Giulietta Masina) bought from her mother by a brutish strongman (Anthony Quinn) who takes her with him on the road. Fellini has called La Strada \\"a complete catalogue of my entire mythological world, a dangerous representation of my identity that was undertaken with no precedent whatsoever.\\" Fellini secured financing through the producers Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, who wanted to cast Silvana Mangano (De Laurentiis' wife) as Gelsomina and Burt Lancaster as Zampano, but Fellini refused these choices. Giulietta Masina had been the inspiration for the entire project, so Fellini was determined never to accept an alternative to her. For Zampano, Fellini had hoped to cast a nonprofessional and, to that end, he tested a number of circus strongmen, to no avail. He also had trouble finding the right person for the role of Il Matto. His first choice was the actor Moraldo Rossi, who was a member of Fellini's social circle and had the right type of personality and athletic physique, but Rossi wanted to be the assistant director, not a performer. Alberto Sordi, the star of Fellini's earlier films The White Sheik and I Vitelloni, was eager to take the role, and was bitterly disappointed when Fellini rejected him after a tryout in costume.  Ultimately, Fellini drew his three leading players from people associated with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampano, later remembering: \\"I thought he was a little bit crazy, and I told him I wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days.\\" Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: \\"I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director was the man who had been chasing me for weeks.\\"  Fellini was particularly taken with Basehart, who reminded the director of Charlie Chaplin. Upon being introduced to Basehart by Cortese, Fellini invited the actor to lunch, at which he was offered the role of Il Matto. When asked why by the surprised Basehart, who had never before played the part of a clown, Fellini responded: \\"Because, if you did what you did in Fourteen Hours you can do anything.\\" A great success in Italy, the 1951 Hollywood drama starred Basehart as a would-be suicide on a hotel balcony. Basehart, too, had been greatly impressed by I Vitelloni, and agreed to take the role for much less than his usual salary, in part because he was very attracted by Fellini's personality, saying: \\"It was his zest for living, and his humor.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who else did he like?","output":"Federico Fellini also liked actor Richard Basehart, who reminded him of Charlie Chaplin. He offered Basehart the role of Il Matto in the film \\"La Strada.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: If all wrestlers are down, how long do they have to rise? Is \\"A wrestler can win by knockout (sometimes referred to as a referee stoppage) if they do not resort to submission holds, but stills pummels their opponent to the point that they are unconscious or are unable to intelligently defend themselves.\\" the correct answer?","output":"The answer you have provided does not directly answer the question. The question is asking how long wrestlers have to rise when they are all down. To provide a detailed and long answer to this question, we should discuss two important aspects: the count duration and how long wrestlers have to get back up. In professional wrestling, a fallen wrestler or wrestlers typically have a specific amount of time to get back on their feet, depending on the rules set by the wrestling promotion or governing body. The most common count duration is a 10-count, but it can vary depending on the circumstances and the promotion. In a standard professional wrestling match, if all wrestlers involved are down on the mat and unable to continue wrestling, the referee starts a count. The wrestlers then have until the referee reaches the specific count (usually 10) to return to their feet or at least make some attempt to show that they can continue wrestling. If at least one wrestler manages to get back up before the count reaches its limit, the match continues. If all wrestlers are still unable to get up by the time the referee reaches the final count, the match is declared a draw or a no-contest. Regarding the statement, \\"A wrestler can win by knockout (sometimes referred to as a referee stoppage) if they do not resort to submission holds, but stills pummels their opponent to the point that they are unconscious or are unable to intelligently defend themselves,\\" it is relevant to the outcome of a wrestling match but not directly to the specific question asked. A knockout victory does not necessarily require all wrestlers to be down at the same time, as the term \\"knockout\\" refers to rendering an opponent incapacitated, unconscious, or unable to continue the match because of strikes or other offensive moves. When a wrestler wins by knockout or referee stoppage, it usually means that the opponent was unable to intelligently defend themselves or was rendered unconscious, leading the referee to intervene and declare the match over in favor of the winning wrestler. In summary, when all wrestlers are down in a professional wrestling match, they usually have until the referee's 10-count (or another predetermined count) to rise or show an intent to continue. If all wrestlers fail to meet this requirement, the match may be declared a draw or a no-contest, not necessarily a knockout victory for any wrestler. The statement provided is related to a knockout victory resulting from a wrestler's successful offense against the opponent but does not directly address the question about wrestlers rising from the mat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joel, on the other hand, seemed a bit puzzled by the situation. While he was generally appreciated for his charming nature and entertaining abilities, this was the first time he found himself not being the center of attention. It suddenly dawned on him that perhaps he needed to make some adjustments in his approach to capture the baby's interest more effectively. Determined not to be left out, Joel decided to put his creativity and resourcefulness to good use. He swiftly glanced around the room, searching for any object that might combine well with his engaging storytelling skills. As his eyes landed on a large, glossy picture book filled with captivating illustrations, a delightful idea began to form in his mind. Joel could hardly contain his excitement as he eagerly opened the book and began crafting an enchanting tale for the baby. The colorful images from the book served as a captivating backdrop for his animated storytelling, complete with various gestures and voices, effectively bringing the characters to life. Dennis, although immersed in the baby's exploration of toys, couldn't help but feel captivated by Joel's energetic performance as well. It wasn't long before the baby's attention was torn between Dennis's alluring toys and Joel's enthralling storytelling.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose death at the height of her fame and was a shock to the musical world? , can you please find it?   Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United...

Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which beaker's particles are moving slower?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.","output":"Beaker A's particles are moving slower because it is on a burner set to a low temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For 35 bewildering minutes Sunday night, the Super Bowl showdown between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers ground to a halt when half of the lights in the New Orleans Superdome went out. Players stretched on the field. The more than 71,000 fans in attendance did the wave. And with no immediate explanation for the outage, social media lit up. From Twitter to Facebook, from Tumblr to Flickr, it seemed just about everywhere in the social media-sphere somebody had something to say -- sometimes funny, sometimes not so much -- about what became known online as \\"the blackout bowl.\\" \\"Once the issue was detected, the sensing equipment operated as designed and opened a breaker, causing power to be partially cut to the OPTIONS: - Baltimore Ravens in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - CNN in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - Facebook in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - Flickr in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - Nabisco in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - New Orleans Superdome in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - Oreo in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - San Francisco 49ers in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - Super Bowl in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - Super Bowl MVP in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - Tide in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - Tumblr in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. - Twitter in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said.","output":"New Orleans Superdome in order to isolate the issue,\\" the statement said. The power outage was initially an alarming and unexpected event, leaving players, fans, and viewers on edge. However, the situation was soon brought under control as the stadium crew worked closely with local utility providers to identify the root cause. According to the official statement, \\"Once the issue was detected, the sensing equipment operated as designed and opened a breaker, causing power to be partially cut to the New Orleans Superdome in order to isolate the issue.\\" While the interruption may have been disruptive, it also provided advertisers with an unexpected opportunity. Companies, such as Oreo, Tide, and Nabisco, were quick to capitalize on the blackout, producing clever, impromptu social media campaigns that went viral in the midst of the outage. As the teams warmed up, and fans waited for play to resume, the event highlighted both the importance of reliable infrastructure and the growing influence of social media. The power was eventually restored, and the Baltimore Ravens went on to win the game with a score of 34-31. In the aftermath of the blackout bowl, many discussions were held about the complexity of hosting such a significant event and the need to ensure that proper measures are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. Since then, the New Orleans Superdome has undergone renovations to strengthen its utility infrastructure. Despite the challenges and the unexpected turn of events, the 2013 Super Bowl will always be remembered as an iconic moment in sports history, with the power outage becoming an unforgettable part of the narrative surrounding the game. Moreover, it served as a prime example of how social media has become a powerful tool for communication and marketing, with the ability to turn even a blackout into a branding opportunity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field? from the following article ?  Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north-south trending ridge. It has an elevation of 2,162 m (7,093 ft) and is one of the older volcanic features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining products from Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge. These volcanics were likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow, flat-topped, steep-sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge. The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.Pali Dome, located north and northeast of Mount Cayley, is an eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field.

Orifici had different professions and operated in different fields, making it difficult to directly compare their scope of profession. Paul Czinner (1890-1972) was a prominent Austrian film director, screenwriter, and producer. He worked mainly during the silent film era and the early years of sound films. Some of his successful films include \\"The Fiddler of Florence\\" (1926), \\"Nju, A Story From Life\\" (1924), and \\"Don Carlos\\" (1921). He also directed and produced several Shakespeare adaptations and operatic films. His wife, the famous British actress Elisabeth Bergner, often starred in his films. Benjamin T. Orifici is an intellectual property attorney who specializes in patent law in the United States. He has experience in various industries, including computer software, telecommunications, medical devices, and consumer products. He helps clients to protect their intellectual property rights related to patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Being an attorney, the scope of his profession is in providing legal advice and services to clients in the field of intellectual property. Comparing the two professions, it is clear that both professionals had/have different fields of expertise, with Czinner focused on filmmaking and Orifici on law. Thus, it is not possible to determine who has more scope of profession directly. The scope and success of each individual's profession depend on various factors, such as industry trends, market needs, and personal achievements.

In Mark 15:25 crucifixion takes place at the third hour (9 a.m.) and Jesus' death at the ninth hour (3 p.m.). However, in John 19:14 Jesus is still before Pilate at the sixth hour. Scholars have presented a number of arguments to deal with the issue, some suggesting a reconciliation, e.g., based on the use of Roman timekeeping in John but not in Mark, yet others have rejected the arguments. Several notable scholars have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts, written at a time when no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available, and time was often approximated to the closest three-hour period. Why do scholars say the times are different depending on the gospel it's written in?","output":"Scholars say the times are different depending on the gospel it's written in due to several factors: 1. Different authors: Each gospel was written by different authors, and they might have had different sources or perspectives regarding the events. It is possible that each author reported the times based on their own understanding or the information available to them. 2. Literary purposes: Each gospel writer had a specific purpose and audience in mind while writing their account. They might have used different times or details to emphasize certain aspects of the story or to make theological points that were important to their intended readers. 3. No standardized timekeeping: As you mentioned, there was no standardization of timepieces or exact recording of hours and minutes during the time when the gospel accounts were written. This could result in the authors approximating the time based on their own or their sources' understanding of the events. 4. Cultural context: Different timekeeping systems were in use in the ancient world. The Roman and Jewish methods of measuring time were not the same, which could lead to discrepancies in the accounts. Some scholars suggest that John used Roman timekeeping while Mark might have used Jewish timekeeping. 5. Variations in oral traditions: Before the gospels were written down, the stories of Jesus were passed down orally. It is possible that slight variations in the telling and retelling of these stories could have resulted in the differences in the timing of events. 6. Textual variations: The manuscript traditions of the gospels have numerous variations, and it is possible that the differences in timing could be due to scribal errors or alterations in the texts during the process of copying and transmission. Overall, the differences in timing in the gospel accounts are likely due to a combination of these factors, and it is essential to consider the historical and literary context in which the gospels were written to understand why these variations exist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd.

The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal.  - An economy car is an automobile that is designed for low cost purchase and operation. Typical economy cars are small (compact or subcompact), lightweight, and inexpensive to buy. Economy car designers are forced by stringent design constraints to be inventive. Many innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model T and the Austin Mini. Gordon Murray, the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car: \\"I would say that building a car to sell for six thousand pounds and designing that for a high volume production, where you have all the quality issues under control is a hundred times more difficult than designing a Mclaren F1, or even a racing car. It is certainly the biggest challenge I've ever had from a design point of view.\\" The alternative approach other than innovating to build a low cost car, is build a stripped down no frills version of a conventional car.  - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer.

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound.

Rex Ryan: Foot-Fetish Report 'Personal Matter' FLORHAM PARK, N.J. – New York Jets coach Rex Ryan says it's a \\"personal matter\\" and declined to talk about a \\"foot-fetish\\" report posted by the sports website Deadspin that show four videos of a woman who bears a close resemblance to Ryan's wife, Michelle. The videos show a woman displaying her toes to an off-screen cameraman who, in one video, sounds a lot like the coach. The two are having an intimate chat about her feet. During his news conference Wednesday, Ryan declined several times to discuss the situation. \\"I understand I'm going to get asked this question frontways, sideways, backways, and all this, but it is a personal matter,\\" he said. Asked if the NFL might look into the report, spokesman Greg Aiello said the league also considered it a personal matter. Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum said in a brief statement that he and owner Woody Johnson met with Ryan and the coach has their \\"full support.\\" Like everyone else, they considered it a personal matter. This isn't the first time the Jets have turned up on Deadspin this season. In October, the site reported that Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre sent racy text messages and photos to a former game hostess while he was the Jets' quarterback in 2008. The NFL is still investigating the allegations. According to Deadspin, the woman in the video goes by the handle \\"ihaveprettyfeet.\\" A still photograph from one of the video clips was splashed across the front of the New York Daily News and showed a woman with her feet hanging out of an SUV. She is approached by someone who is not on camera and he tells her that she has \\"really beautiful feet.\\" The other videos show the woman sitting on a couch, having a drink, reading a book and sitting on a porch and rubbing her feet. \\"My wife's beautiful,\\" Ryan said when asked about his wife. \\"We've been married for 23 years. She's awesome.\\" A few weeks ago, before the Jets played New England, Ryan compared his wife to Giselle Bundchen, who is married to Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Ryan said he was \\"also married to a supermodel.\\" \\"I don't want to say that I probably shouldn't have done that,\\" Ryan said. While the Jets have a big game coming up against the Bears in which they can clinch a postseason berth if the win, the focus again is on the team's off-field issues. \\"We're going to be ready to play Chicago,\\" Ryan said. \\"I am ready. This is my job and I'm focused on the job at hand.\\" Most players declined comment on the foot-fetish report, but star cornerback Darrelle Revis supported his coach. \\"Foot fetish? Whatever,\\" Revis said. \\"I mean, that's his wife. At the end of the day, that's his wife and he can do whatever he wants with his wife. It's not like he's out committing adultery or anything negative.\\" Last week, the team suspended an assistant coach indefinitely for tripping a Miami player and ordering inactive players to form a sideline wall. Sal Alosi, the Jets' strength and conditioning coach, was suspended without pay for the rest of the season, including the playoffs, and fined an additional 25,000. The Jets were investigated by the league in September after a female reporter, Ines Sainz of TV Azteca, said she felt uncomfortable in the team's locker room. The Jets developed a workplace conduct program, underwritten by owner Woody Johnson. In January, Ryan was fined 50,000 by the team after he was caught on a cell phone camera flipping his middle finger at a fan during a mixed martial arts competition in Sunrise, Fla. The image of Ryan quickly spread across the Internet and made its way onto the back pages of New York tabloids. He apologized the next day in a statement, calling his actions \\"stupid and inappropriate.\\" What was this article about?","output":"The article discusses former New York Jets coach Rex Ryan's response to a foot-fetish report posted on the sports website Deadspin.

Question: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general.

Paragraph:  Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Given the question: Information:  - Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\".  - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.  - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.  - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - George Harrison, (25 February 1943  29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song.  - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region.  - Sir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.  - The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the Western world between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the American Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and became revolutionary with the expansion of the US government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born, catalyzed, or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s.  - \\"Beatlemania\\" is a term that originated and was coined during the early 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed towards the English rock band the Beatles. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966.  - The Beatles ' Hits EP was released 6 September 1963 . It is The Beatles second British EP and was only released in mono , with the catalogue number Parlophone GEP 8880 . This EP can be seen as an early example of a greatest hits release . It was also released in Australia and New Zealand .  - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music.

A:","output":"Title: The Clockwork of Destiny Genre: Science Fiction/Drama Plot Summary: In the near-future, scientists have developed 'The Oracle,' a highly advanced supercomputer capable of predicting all aspects of an individual's future. Praised as humanity's greatest accomplishment, the machine's predictions have led to a harmonious, almost Utopian society, free of conflict, crime, poverty, and heartbreak. However, the machine's influence comes at a price - the loss of free will. Dr. Samuel Locke, the inventor of 'The Oracle,' is regarded as the world's savior. However, he himself questions the morality of his invention, and secretly regrets giving up the world's freedom for a false senselessness of safety. The story begins when Dr. Locke meets a young woman, Helen, whose life is turned upside down by the machine's predictions. Plagued by the limits and expectations placed on her by society, she grows resentful of the machine and the life it has trapped her in. Together, Samuel and Helen form a deep bond, and hatch a plan to reclaim their destinies by finding a flaw in the machine's programming. As they embark on this dangerous journey, they face many obstacles - from the government, who wants to keep their society 'perfect' at all costs, to even their loved ones, blinded by the machine's infallibility. Slowly, Helen and Dr. Locke uncover secrets buried deep within 'The Oracle's architecture, suggesting that a mysterious organization might be controlling and manipulating its predictions. In a thrilling climax, Helen and Samuel fight against time, racing to expose the truth to the world. Finally cornered by the organization's sinister enforcers, Helen and Samuel perform a risky and irreversible action to sever the machine's connection to the world - and in doing so, the machine gives one last groan and shuts down. With its power extinguished, it feels like a veil is lifted from society. The people, once so dependent on the machine's guidance, are now left to forge their own paths in life. Bittersweetly, Helen and Dr. Locke's personal sacrifices serve as a catalyst for a new world, where individuals are free to pursue their dreams without the constraints of predetermined destiny. In the end, through love, sacrifice, and the unwavering belief in human potential, Dr. Samuel Locke and Helen reignite the flame of hope and free will for all of humanity."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The band is composed of Damian Kulash (lead vocals, guitar), Tim Nordwind (bass guitar and vocals), Dan Konopka (drums and percussion) and Andy Ross (guitar, keyboards and vocals), who joined them in 2005, replacing Andy Duncan. The band is known for its often quirky and elaborate one-take music videos. The original members formed as OK Go in 1998 and released two studio albums before Duncan's departure. Though the band had offers from bigger labels, the band signed to Capitol Records in April 2001 believing that, as the first signing by newly hired label president Andy Slater, they would get more attention and support.  The band released its debut album, OK Go, on September 17, 2002, after it was pushed back by the label from its original June release date. The album was recorded at the Capitol Studios in Los Angeles and, though the original plan was to do minor tweaks to the original demos, the band ended up rerecording everything and adding five new songs, including the first single \\"Get Over It,\\" which later appeared in Triple Play Baseball and Madden NFL 2003 video games. To promote the release, the label sent out miniature ping pong tables to press outlets, a reference to the \\"Get Over It\\" video directed by Francis Lawrence. In support of the album, the band toured with a diverse group of acts including the Vines, Phantom Planet, Superdrag, the Donnas, Fountains of Wayne, and Mew, and played a number of festival shows including Leeds in 2002 and 2003, and NoisePop, Reading, Witnness, and T in the Park in 2003.  In the United States, the album reached #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart and #107 on the Billboard 200 Chart. In the United Kingdom, the first single \\"Get Over It\\" debuted at no. 27, in the UK singles chart on March 16, 2003, and the band performed it on that week's edition of Top of the Pops. Also that week, the single's video was named video of the week by Q magazine.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did the do any music videos?","output":"Yes, the band is known for its often quirky and elaborate one-take music videos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There were only a very few years that he was really ' engaged ' in my life ... and even then there was a lot of disconnect . But still , his presence was powerful . Question Why is the narrator so mournful and feeling sadness ? Answer:","output":"The narrator is experiencing a deep sense of mournfulness and sadness due to the loss of their father. This emotional response can be attributed to various factors that have contributed to their current feelings and thoughts. Firstly, it is important to recognize that the fifth anniversary of the father's passing is a significant milestone. This date serves as a reminder of the time that has passed since the father's death and emphasizes the absence of their presence in the narrator's life. Anniversaries can trigger strong emotions as they evoke memories and longing for the person who is no longer with us, which can manifest in a heightened sense of grief. Secondly, the narrator highlights that they miss their father more now than ever, indicating that time has not diminished their feelings of loss. It is not uncommon for the pain of losing a loved one to intensify over time as we continue to experience life without them and realize the permanent nature of their absence. The feeling of missing them might grow as life progresses and significant events occur, which the lost loved one can no longer be a part of.  Furthermore, the narrator mentions that their father was only engaged in their life for a few years and even during that period, there was a disconnect. This likely signifies unresolved emotions, unaddressed issues, or unfulfilled relationship aspirations between the narrator and their father. The regret and longing for a more substantial connection with their father can contribute to the mourning and sadness that they currently feel. Their father's powerful presence, despite the disconnect, highlights the fact that there was still love and admiration, making the narrator wish they could have experienced a closer bond. Additionally, the loss of a parent can have a profound impact on someone's life. It can feel like losing a pillar of strength, wisdom, and guidance, which can be challenging to come to terms with. As the narrator reflects on their father's life and death, they might be mourning the loss of not just a parent, but also a role model, confidant, or friend that they didn't fully get the chance to bond with. In conclusion, the narrator's feelings of mournfulness and sadness are rooted in their father's passing, the significant milestone of the fifth anniversary, the realization of the impact time has on the grieving process, and the unfulfilled desires related to their relationship with their father. It is a multifaceted emotional response stemming from the complex nature of human bonds, loss, and the passage of time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: To add hair to a clay sculpture, you can How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of adding hair to a clay sculpture, you can follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather the necessary materials: Before you begin, gather your clay, sculpting tools, clay carving tools, and clay slip (a mixture of clay and water used as an adhesive) or vinegar. It is essential to have all the necessary tools and materials at hand while working on your sculpture. 2. Choose the right clay: It is crucial to select the right type of clay for your project. The best type of clay to use for sculpting hair is polymer clay or modeling clay, which is easy to manipulate and can be baked to harden after sculpting. Make sure the clay you choose is compatible with the clay used for your primary sculpture. 3. Create a sketch or reference: Before you start sculpting, create a sketch or gather reference images of hair designs you want to use as inspiration for your sculpture. This will help you visualize the final result and plan the hair's structure, texture, and flow. 4. Prepare your sculpture: If your clay sculpture is still damp and moldable, you can begin to add hair directly. However, if your sculpture is already dry or baked, use a carving tool to create small indents or channels in the shape of the hairline to help the clay adhere better. 5. Roll out thin strands of clay: On a clean surface, roll out thin strands of clay using your fingers or a clay extruder. The strands' thickness will depend on the effect you want to achieve, but it is essential to make them as uniform as possible. 6. Apply the clay strands to the sculpture: Start by attaching strands of clay at the hairline using clay slip or vinegar as an adhesive. Use a clay modeling tool to gently press the clay strands onto the head, ensuring a secure hold. Continue adding strands one by one, working from the hairline to the crown of the head, and then down to the back. Be patient during this process and take your time to ensure proper adhesion and a realistic appearance. 7. Layering and blending: To create a natural look, layer and blend the strands of clay to achieve the desired hair volume and style. Use a sculpting tool to help blend the strands by pressing them gently into each other. This will create a seamless appearance and ensure that the hair looks natural and sculpted. 8. Add texture and detail: Once your hair strands are in place, you can use a variety of sculpting tools and techniques to create texture and details. For example, you can use a needle tool or a fine comb to create realistic hairlines, curls, or waves. Be careful not to overwork the clay, as it may become weak and break. 9. Final adjustments: As you continue sculpting, make any final adjustments to the hair's style and shape. Check the overall balance and proportions, and ensure that the hair's flow and texture are consistent throughout the sculpture. 10. Let the clay dry or bake: Once you have completed sculpting the hair, allow the clay to air dry completely (usually takes 24-72 hours) based on the manufacturer's instructions. If you used polymer clay, follow the baking instructions provided with the clay packaging to harden the hair. Be sure to support the sculpture and hair during the drying or baking process to prevent any deformation or damage. 11. Optional finishing touches: After the clay has dried or been baked, you can add paint, varnish, or glaze to enhance the hair's appearance and protect it from damage. Remember, practice makes perfect, and adding realistic hair to a clay sculpture can be a challenging and time-consuming task. But with patience, persistence, and attention to detail, you will surely achieve a beautiful and lifelike result."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

We combine them by adding their coefficients: -2361 + 2368 = 7 Now we have: 7*y = -56 Step 2: Isolate the variable y.  To do this, we need to get y by itself on the left side of the equation.

Answer based on context: In week three, Chicago hosted the 2-0 Pittsburgh Steelers, who trailed the all-time series 18-7-1 and had not defeated the Bears since 2005. WBBM-TV writer Jeff Joniak described the Bears as in \\"clean-up mode\\" after a poor performance in Tampa. The battle between the Bears' rushing attack and the Steelers' run defense featured the former averaging just 2.9 yards per carry (27th in the league) taking on a defense that allowed just 74 yards per game and 3.3 yards per carry. Joniak added Chicago's running game should try to make progress on early downs to allow Mike Glennon to succeed against Pittsburgh. Defensively, Joniak wrote the Bears had \\"their hands full\\" as Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was aided by receivers Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant, running back Le'Veon Bell, and tight end Jesse James. In spite of Pittsburgh's success in contrast with Chicago's struggles, a common belief was that the Steelers would often \\"play down to their competition,\\" one that was spurned in the wake of Glennon's 2014 Buccaneers upsetting the Steelers 27-24. The first two drives of the game ended with punts, but on the Bears' first punt of the game, Steelers returner Eli Rogers muffed the ball and Sherrick McManis recovered. Jordan Howard would score a three-yard touchdown run on the drive. On the Steelers' next drive, Roethlisberger was sacked by Bryce Callahan and fumbled, with Akiem Hicks recovering. The takeaway failed to result in points, however, as Connor Barth missed a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Roethlisberger threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Brown, which the Bears responded via Glennon's two-yard touchdown pass to Adam Shaheen. On the final play of the first half, Chris Boswell's 35-yard field goal was blocked by McManis into Marcus Cooper's hands. Cooper raced down the field before suddenly slowing down before he reached the end zone, which allowed Pittsburgh's Vance McDonald to knock the ball away at the one-yard line. The ball was then batted out of the end zone, which led to a penalty against the Steelers and an untimed play for the Bears. A false start penalty on Charles Leno Jr. prompted the Bears to instead kick a 24-yard field goal. In the second half, the Bears suffered their first turnover of the game when Howard was stripped by Ryan Shazier; the Steelers took advantage to score on Bell's one-yard touchdown run. A second giveaway occurred when Glennon's pass for Zach Miller was intercepted by J. J. Wilcox, which enabled the Steelers to tie the game on Boswell's 32-yard field goal. The game remained scoreless through the rest of the half, resulting in overtime. After winning the coin toss to start overtime with the ball, the Bears quickly scored on the second play of the series; Tarik Cohen broke through for a 73-yard touchdown run, but was ruled to have stepped out of bounds at the Steelers' 37-yard line. Two plays later, Howard scored the game-winning touchdown on a 19-yard run. In claiming their first victory of the season, the Bears' running backs provided a solid performance, recording a combined 220 yards on the ground - 200 yards more than in week two.

Answer the following question: Process:  - To bake a cake you first need to gather your ingredients - Preheat the oven to desired baking temperature - Grease your preferred cake pan with crisco or butter or other non-stick spray - Add eggs and vegetable oil to the dry ingredients - Stir or whisk until all the dry flour has been absorbed - Pour the batter into the greased cake pan - Place cake pan into the oven for the required time - When a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, the cake is done baking -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more lava cools happens, how will it affect a SMALLER cake.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more lava cooling occurs, it will affect a smaller cake. We need to determine if this hypothesis has any direct or indirect effect on the cake baking process. Step 2: List the steps involved in the cake baking process. - Gathering the ingredients - Preheating the oven to desired baking temperature - Greasing the cake pan with non-stick agents - Adding eggs and vegetable oil to the dry ingredients - Stirring or whisking the batter until evenly mixed - Pouring the batter into the greased cake pan - Baking the cake in the oven for the required time - Checking cake's doneness using a toothpick Step 3: Examine the hypothesis's impact on the process. The hypothesis is concerned with lava cooling events which are not involved in the process of baking a cake. Lava cooling is a geologic event that occurs when molten rock from a volcanic eruption cools and solidifies. It is unrelated to the baking process, which requires a controlled heat source (the oven) to cook the cake batter.  Step 4: Determine if there is an indirect effect. As the lava cooling events do not directly impact the baking process, we must consider any indirect effects. Lava cooling could impact the availability of resources (i.e., if a volcanic eruption affects the production and distribution of cake ingredients). However, the connection between lava cooling and the cake baking process is remote and not directly applicable to the specific process of baking a smaller cake. Step 5: Conclusion Based on the analysis, the perturbation hypothesis, which is related to more lava cooling events, does not have a direct nor indirect effect on the process of baking a smaller cake. The baking process remains the same, regardless of the hypothesis, and is unaffected by the occurrence of additional lava cooling."},{"instruction":"Question: Information:  - Sumatra is a large island in western Indonesia that is part of the Sunda Islands.

Summarize: You will be able to prevent future bites if you know what sort of bugs you're dealing with. Bed bug bites, most common around the home, are large, splotchy, red bites. If you've ever been bitten by a mosquito, bed bug bites look very similar.  Flea bites will be smaller red bites. They often appear around the ankles or lower legs. If you have pets, get them checked for fleas. You can pick up a flea medication at your local veterinarian office. Bites from lice will appear in your hair. You may not be able to see them, so have a friend or family member check for you. They are red and itchy. These bites can also appear in other areas which have body hair. You don't want to mistake other irritants for bug bites. Allergies cause similar redness and swelling, as do toxic chemicals such as pesticides or solvents. Emotional stress and anxiety can also cause similar breakouts. To prevent insects from getting into bed and biting you at night, wash and change your sheets often. Your dead skin cells will fill your bed, and these cells will attract insects. Washing your sheets every other week isn't terrible, but a weekly cleaning is ideal.  Even if you cannot see the bugs in your bed, they can definitely be present. Tiny microscopic bugs called dust mites may be biting you at night. These bugs are attracted to the dead skin cells that stick to dirty sheets. Use hot, soapy water to get a deep clean on your sheets. Make sure that you let them dry completely in the dryer. Moist sheets can collect mold. If you've washed your sheets and you're still finding bites or insects in your bed, buy new sheets. It's a bit of an investment, but you'll be thankful in the long haul. Try moving your bed frame away from the wall. Even a few inches of space can be helpful. You'll reduce the ability for bugs to move between the wall and your bed. Most bugs will scurry into any opening in a bed that you leave for them. It's best, therefore, to eliminate any area that they could nest in. Don't let your sheets drape onto the ground.  Remember that bed bugs cannot fly or jump. You can take advantage of their fairly limited mobility by tucking your sheets in. If you have dust mites, however, you actually don't want to make your bed.  If you leave your bed unmade, you'll remove moisture from your sheets and mattress. Eventually, the mites will dehydrate and die. Dust mites need humidity to survive, so any dry environment will kill them. It isn't enough just eradicate bugs from your bed itself. You'll need to use a vacuum to kill any remaining bugs. You also want to pick up scrap particles from your carpet. Any extra detritus will attract bugs into your area. Vacuum often to ensure that your carpet will be free of creatures in the future.  Get an attachment for the vacuum to access hard to reach places. This could include the space behind your headboard or along the tack strips at the edge of your carpet. Be sure to move your bed from its usual location. You need to clean the entirety of your carpeted floor. If you don't have carpet, you can use a mop with soap and water to clean the area around your bed. Even if you don't have a pool or another body of water near your house, you may still be attracting bugs to your property. Mosquitos lay eggs their eggs near sources of water, so they will take advantage of any liquid that could be out in your home.  Drill holes in open containers, such as trash cans, that may be collecting water in them. Change birdbaths and pets' water bowls as often as you can. These are breeding grounds for mosquitos to be laying eggs. Don't leave pots, pans, or full glasses of water out.","output":"To prevent bug bites, first identify the type of bug you're dealing with. Bed bug bites are large and similar to mosquito bites. Flea bites are smaller and often appear around the ankles or lower legs, while lice bites appear in hair and other body hair areas. To avoid bites, change and wash your sheets frequently, and clean your sleeping area thoroughly using a vacuum or mop. Keep your bed away from the wall and eliminate potential nesting areas. For dust mites, leaving the bed unmade can create a dry environment leading to their dehydration and death. Eliminate standing water around your home to reduce the mosquito population. Regular cleaning, taking care of pets, and maintaining a clean environment can help prevent future bug bites."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence: \\"A pilot must be flying this plane.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"A pilot must be flying this plane\\" as acceptable linguistically, taking into consideration the structure, syntax, and semantics of the sentence. To analyze this sentence, it is important to break down the components and determine how they function within the language system. 1. Structure: The sentence consists of a subject (\\"A pilot\\"), a modal auxiliary verb (\\"must\\"), a continuous verb phrase (\\"be flying\\"), and an object (\\"this plane\\"). This structure is consistent with English syntax, as it follows the common subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern. The modal verb \\"must\\" is used correctly in conjunction with the continuous verb phrase \\"be flying,\\" which signifies an ongoing action. 2. Syntax: The syntax of the sentence is in line with the rules governing English grammar. The subject, \\"A pilot,\\" is a singular noun phrase that features an indefinite article \\"A\\" and the noun \\"pilot.\\" The modal auxiliary verb \\"must\\" is correctly employed to express obligation or necessity, while the verb phrase \\"be flying\\" contains the linking verb \\"be\\" followed by the present participle \\"flying.\\" Finally, the object, \\"this plane,\\" is a noun phrase that begins with the demonstrative pronoun \\"this\\" and the noun \\"plane.\\" All of these elements are combined to form a complete sentence that is both grammatically and syntactically correct. 3. Semantics: The meaning conveyed by this sentence, which is the idea that a pilot is required to be operating the aircraft, is clear and coherent. The intended message is easily understood by English speakers, as all of the words and their respective roles within the sentence contribute to the overall meaning. 4. Context: Considering context is critical when evaluating the acceptability of a sentence. While the sentence is linguistically correct, a linguist might ask additional questions about the context in which the sentence is used. For example, if the sentence were spoken by someone observing an autonomous drone or an aircraft on autopilot, a different sentence like \\"The autopilot is flying this plane\\" would be more appropriate. However, without knowing the specific context, the sentence itself is undoubtedly acceptable in terms of its linguistic properties. In conclusion, a linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"A pilot must be flying this plane\\" as acceptable linguistically based on its structure, syntax, and semantics. The sentence adheres to the rules and conventions of the English language, and its meaning is transparent and easily understood. However, it is crucial to consider the context in which the sentence is used to determine its absolute appropriateness in a given situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to secure a playoff spot, the Vikings need a win in Denver in week 17, as well as a loss by the Redskins against Dallas. Because of this loss in week 16, if Washington wins its last game, the Vikings will be eliminated from the playoffs regardless of the outcome of the Denver game. Based on the above article, answer a question. Which quarterback rushed for a touchdown?","output":"In that game, the quarterback who rushed for a touchdown was Tarvaris Jackson from the Minnesota Vikings. He ran 6 yards to score a touchdown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.\\",  answer the following question.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Christian democracy is a political ideology which emerged in nineteenth-century Europe under the influence of conservatism and Catholic social teaching, as well as Neo-Calvinism. It was originally conceived as a combination of traditional Catholic beliefs and modern democratic ideas, and it grew to incorporate the social teaching of other Christian denominations, such as the Lutheran Church and the Reformed Church. After World War II, the Protestant and Catholic movements of the Social Gospel and Neo-Thomism, respectively, played a role in shaping Christian democracy. Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, although it is present in other parts of the world too.  - The Centrist Democrat International is Christian Democrat political international. Until 2001 it was known as the Christian Democrat International (CDI) and before that the \\"Christian Democrat and People's Parties International\\" (until 1999) (this earlier name is, since October 2000, still sometimes used colloquially). It was formed in 1961 in Santiago, Chile as the \\"Christian Democrat World Union\\", building on the legacy of other Christian Democrat internationals who tried to create a Christian-inspired third way alternative to the socialist internationals; in 1982 it was renamed for the first time Christian Democrat International. The name officially changed due to the participation of groups of various faiths. It is the global international political group dedicated to the promotion of Christian democracy. Although it gathers parties from around the globe, its members are drawn principally from Europe and Latin America. Some of them are also members of the International Democrat Union (IDU), although the CDI is closer to the political centre and more communitarian than the IDU.  - A European political party (formally, a political party at European level; informally a Europarty) is a type of political party organisation operating transnationally in Europe and in the institutions of the European Union. They are regulated and funded by the European Union and are usually made up of national parties, not individuals. Europarties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections and express themselves within the European Parliament by their affiliated political groups and their MEPs. Europarties, through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government, influence the decision-making process of the European Council. Europarties also work closely and co-ordinate with their affiliated members of the European Commission and, according to the Lisbon Treaty the Europarty that wins the European elections has the right to nominate to the European Council its candidate for President of the European Commission.  - The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a global inter-parliamentary institution established in 1889 by Frédéric Passy (France) and William Randal Cremer (United Kingdom). It was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, the organization was for individual parliamentarians, but has since transformed into an international organization of the parliaments of sovereign states. The national parliaments of 170 countries are members of the IPU, and 11 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members. The IPU has permanent observer status at the United Nations General Assembly and general consultative status with the Economic and Social Council.  - Santiago de Chile is the capital and largest city of Chile. It is also the center of its largest conurbation. Santiago is located in the country's central valley, at an elevation of above mean sea level.  - The European People's Party (EPP) is a European political party. A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties, not individuals. Founded by primarily Christian democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives.  - Lorenzo Cesa (born 16 August 1951 in Arcinazzo Romano, Rome) is an Italian politician, and was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 2006 General election representing the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats. He was elected on October 27, 2005 as new party leader, replacing resigning secretary Marco Follini.  - The Union of the Centre ( Italian : Unione di Centro , UdC ) is a Christian democratic political party in Italy . Its secretary is Lorenzo Cesa , but its most popular figure and actual leader is Pier Ferdinando Casini . The party is a member of the European People 's Party and the Centrist Democrat International , of which Casini is president . The party was formed in December 2002 as the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats ( Unione dei Democratici Cristiani e di Centro , UDC ) as the merger of the Christian Democratic Centre , the United Christian Democrats and European Democracy . In 2008 the party was the driving force behind the UdC , an alliance comprising , among others , The Rose for Italy , the Populars for the Constituent Assembly of the Centre , the Liberal Clubs , the Party of Christian Democracy , Christian Democratic Party , Veneto for the European People 's Party , the Democratic Populars and the Autonomist Democrats . Since then , the party 's official name was neglected in favour of \`\` Union of the Centre '' and , since most of the UdC member parties have joined the UDC too , the UDC and the UdC started to overlap almost completely to the point that they are now undistinguishable . The UDC was part of the Pole / House of Freedoms from its establishment through 2008 . Later it has been affiliated neither to the centre - right nor the centre - left at the national level . Despite this , the party takes part in several regional , provincial and municipal governments with Forza Italia , the largest force of the Italian centre - right ( notably in Campania and Calabria ) , but recently formed alliances also with the centre - left Democratic Party in other regions ( notably in Marche ) and at the very local level . In the 2013 general election the UdC was part of With Monti for Italy , the coalition formed around Mario Monti 's Civic Choice . More recently the party , which sits in the Renzi Cabinet , has sided with the Angelino Alfano 's New Centre - Right .  - The International Democrat Union (IDU) is an international alliance of centre-right political parties. Headquartered in Oslo, Norway, the IDU comprises 71 full and associate members from 63 different countries. It is chaired by John Key, former Prime Minister of New Zealand.  - Arcinazzo Romano is a \\"comune\\" (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Rome in the Italian region Latium, located about east of Rome.  - Pier Ferdinando Casini (born 3 December 1955) is an Italian politician.

Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not.  But I can use this background: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend ate more foods free of contaminations? A:","output":"Based on the provided background information, Manny, who eats organic foods and drinks organic milk, is more likely to consume foods that are free of contaminations. Organic food production aims to minimize the use of chemicals, and organic farms have been shown to have fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Therefore, Manny's food choices would be comparatively less contaminated than Annie's, who eats all types of foods, including non-organic options, which may have a higher likelihood of containing chemical residues and contaminants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943. Question: What was charted in 1939?","output":"In 1939, the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority was charted by the State General Assembly. The goal of this charter was to facilitate the establishment and construction of a larger airport situated between the cities of Raleigh and Durham. This was part of a broader initiative related to infrastructure development and economic recovery during the period of the Great Depression. The 1930s, defined by the economic hardships of the Great Depression, saw a substantial government intervention in a bid to create jobs. This involved both the implementation of various recreational and educational programs and the employment of people in public works projects to boost the economy and alleviate the widespread joblessness. It was within this context that several crucial developments happened in Raleigh. In 1932, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated, becoming an important cultural hub for the city. In the same year, the North Carolina Symphony was founded and it performed subsequently in its new home - the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium. This not only provided jobs for musicians but also enriched the cultural life of the community. From 1934 to 1937, the Civilian Conservation Corps, a federal entity, undertook a significant project with the construction of the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. The Civilian Conservation Corps was a part of the New Deal program by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, aimed at providing jobs for young men and boosting the economic recovery. The creation of Umstead State Park was part of this broader effort, leading to enhanced recreational opportunities for the local community and conservation of natural resources. However, it was in 1939 when the State General Assembly took a significant step toward expanding the area's transportation infrastructure. The assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority specifically for constructing a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham. The objective was to improve the area's connectivity and boost economic growth by attracting more business and tourism to the region. A bigger airport was seen as vital in achieving this goal, and the first flight from this airport took place in 1943.  In summary, the 1930s, particularly the latter half, was a period of substantial development for the Raleigh-Durham area, led by government-initiated public works projects. Among these developments, the chartering of the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority in 1939 was significant as it laid the groundwork for a larger airport that would later be crucial in the region's growth and economic recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Our dreams do not come from another world. They are not messages from some outside source .They are not a look into the future, either. All our dreams have something to do with our feelings, fears, longings, wishes, needs and memories. If a person is hungry, or tired, or cold , his dreams may include a feeling of this kind. If the covers on your body, such as a quilt or a blanket, have slipped off your bed, you may dream that you are sleeping on ice or in snow. The material for the dream you will have tonight is likely to come from the experience you have today. So the subject of your dream usually comes from something that has effect on you while you are sleeping(feeling of cold, a noise, a discomfort, etc.)and it may also use your past experiences and the wishes and the interests you have now. This is why children are likely to dream of fairies, older children of school examinations, hungry people of food, home-sick soldiers of their families and prisoners of freedom. To show you how this is happening while you are asleep and how your needs and wishes can all be joined together in a dream, here is the story of the experiment. A man was asleep and the back of his hand was rubbed with a piece of soft cotton. He would dream he was in hospital and his charming girlfriend was visiting him, sitting on the bed and feeling gently his hands! There are some scientists who have made a special study of why we dream, what we dream and what those dreams mean. Their explanation of dreams, though a bit reasonable, is not accepted by everyone but it offers an interesting approach to the problem. They believe that dreams are mostly expressions of wishes that did not come true. In other words dreaming is a way of having your wishes carried out.

He made a new world record, by skating a total of 5,823 kilometers. Jack Smith, the previous   champion, had skated a total of 4,830 kilometers across the US in 2003. Dave's journey started in Perth and ended in Brisbane traveling about 60 kilometers a day. It took him five months and 13 pairs of shoes. He had great physical pain and he got really sore feet. If Dave hadn't believed in making his dreams come true, none of this would have happened. Dave left his job two weeks after he had bought a skateboard and decided to go on a journey. He wanted this journey to be about something more than him, so he created an association that would raise money for charities. \\"If people follow my journey and donations, then I'm doing many people a lot of good,\\" said Dave. This journey had plenty of challenges. He traveled across the Australian desert   where temperatures reached 48degC in the day and 0degC at night.

And don't name your child Isis.      For the second year in a row, Emma and Noah top the annual list of top baby names, according to the Social Security Administration. That's the third year on top for Noah and the second in a row for Emma, which was also No. 1 in 2008.      The administration released its annual list of top baby names Friday, and the top five names for girls and boys in 2015 remained unchanged from the previous year. Noah was followed by Liam, Mason, Jacob and William. Emma was followed by Olivia, Sophia, Ava and Isabella. Ava and Isabella switched spots from 2014, with Ava climbing to number 4.      One major change was the girls' name Isis, which had remained steadily in the middle of the pack of the country's top 1,000 names for the last 15 years. In 2015, after the name had emerged as an acronym for the extremist group Islamic State, it dropped completely off the list.      That's a dramatic shift, says Laura Wattenberg, baby name expert and founder of BabynameWizard.com.      \\"It's actually quite rare for a name to be eliminated by issues in the news,\\" she says, noting that the name Adolph was still at No. 555 in the U.S. at the end of World War II when the Nazis and Adolf Hitler fell.      There's another recent example, though: the name Hillary dropped off the list in 2009, a year after Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic presidential primary to Barack Obama. The name was No. 721 in 2008. Hillary remained off the list this year, as did the name of her current Democratic primary opponent, Bernie, as in Sanders.      Barack has never appeared in the top 1,000 names, and the popularity of the name of Obama's predecessor, President George W. Bush, dropped slightly during his eight-year presidency, from No. 130 to No. 163.      The first name of this year's presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, also dropped in 2015, from No. 418 to No. 441.      Wattenberg said that unlike in the past, parents avoid politics in name choices today. But names of past presidents remain popular.      \\"We want our presidents out of office or preferably dead before we name our babies after them,\\" Wattenberg said.      Emma's popularity soared in 2002, the same year that Rachel, a character played by Jennifer Aniston on the TV show \\"Friends,\\" named her baby Emma. Also boosting the name, actress Emma Watson played Hermione Granger in the popular Harry Potter movies.      Emma has been ranked among the top three baby names for girls since 2003, first reaching No. 1 in 2008. In 2013, Emma was No. 2 behind Sophia.      For several years, trends have favored names that are short and smooth — Mia, Liam and Noah — and that have a lot of vowels.      Two girls' names that skyrocketed in popularity in 2015 were Alaia and Adaline, illustrating that vowel trend. Alaia moved up more than 2,000 spots on the list, from No. 2,676 to No. 664.      The reasons for Alaia's rise aren't clear.      \\"Perhaps this can be attributed to high-fashion designer Azzedine Alaia, or maybe it is because of Alaia Baldwin, the model/daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin,\\" speculated the Social Security Administration in a news release.      The name Adaline moved from No. 1,393 to No. 364. \\"The Age of Adaline\\" was a 2015 movie starring Blake Lively.      For boys, the top-rising name is Riaan, which moved from No. 2,286 to No. 926. It's the name of the young son of a well-known Bollywood actor, Riteish Deshmukh.      The Social Security Administration's website provides lists of the top 1,000 baby names for each year, dating to 1880. The top baby names that year were John and Mary. John is now No. 26 and Mary has fallen to No. 124.      ___      Follow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick ||||| Sign up and get access to special features Connect to your Facebook or Twitter account and we'll fill in your registration information.

He does well as a blue collar travelling salesman, moves to New Orleans and marries Stella (Hunter), daughter of an Aristocratic MIssissippi family anxious to escape the war;s invitable destruction of her family's land, wealth, property and social status. Stanley has never met his sister-in-law Blanche, the female lead of the play ,Vivien Leigh in the movie remake. Blanche arranges a visit to see her sister in New Orleans and shows up on Stanley's doorstop obviously annoyed that there is neither a guest bedroom for herself nor a master bedroom for her sister and brother-in-law, in their cramped, dingy apartment in a bustling quarter of the city. The tensions of wartime emergency cohabitation of family members somehow forced to move in with each other in tight, cramped quarters because of the fortunes of war are noted when it is obvious that Blanche and Stanley immediately get on each others' nerves, especially when Blanche, who passes herself off as the only Aristocrat in her new neighborhood, is the only one in her new neighborhood who actually resorts to tough bar language and ethnic slurs in passing conversation. This becomes no ordinary domestic quarrel when their tensions escalate beyond a war of words to hurtful, spiteful deeds and then to climatic physical violence.

Solve this math problem Solve -37*c - 852 = 83*c + 22*c for c.","output":"To solve the equation -37*c - 852 = 83*c + 22*c for c, we first need to combine like terms on both sides of the equation. Like terms are those that have the same variables raised to the same power. 1. Combine like terms on the right side of the equation: 83*c + 22*c can be combined because both terms contain the variable c raised to the first power. Adding the coefficients (the numbers in front of the variable) gives us: 83 + 22 = 105 So, the right side of the equation becomes 105*c. Now the equation looks like this: -37*c - 852 = 105*c 2. Move all terms containing the variable c to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side of the equation: To move the term -37*c to the right side of the equation, we can add 37*c to both sides of the equation: -37*c - 852 + 37*c = 105*c + 37*c Now, -37*c and 37*c cancel each other out on the left side of the equation: -852 = 105*c + 37*c Next, we combine the terms with the variable c on the right side of the equation: 105*c + 37*c = 142*c So now the equation looks like this: -852 = 142*c 3. Solve for c: To isolate the variable c, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, 142: -852 / 142 = 142*c / 142 This simplifies to: c = -852 / 142 Now we can divide -852 by 142: c = -6 So, the solution to the equation -37*c - 852 = 83*c + 22*c is c = -6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: John is a scientist in a large pharmaceutical company. He devices many useful products using his knowledge of chemistry. Today, he has four solutions in front of him, solution A, solution B, solution C, and solution D. Solution A is a buffer, but solution B is not a buffer. Solution C is acidic, but solution D is not acidic. He needs to figure out what each solution does.  But I can use this background: If only 1.0 mL of 0.10 M hydrochloric acid is added to 1.0 L of pure water the pH drops drastically from 7.0 to 4.0. This is a 1000-fold increase in the acidity of the solution. For many purposes, it is desirable to have a solution which is capable of resisting such large changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added to them. Such a solution is called a buffer. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt. Both components must be present for the system to act as a buffer to resist changes in pH. Commercial buffer solutions, which have a wide variety of pH values, can be obtained.  What is an answer for this question: Which solution would resist changes in pH, solution A or solution B?","output":"The solution that would resist changes in pH is solution A, as it is described as a buffer.

Given the question: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Why do bubbles have spherical shape explain with the concept of excess pressure and binding forces ? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? pick from the following.  * no  * yes","output":"To answer the first question, the Gettysburg Address was a historically significant speech delivered by Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War on November 19, 1863. The speech was given at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to honor the fallen soldiers of the battle fought there. Regarding the second question about bubbles, a bubble has a spherical shape because this form minimizes the surface area, which also minimizes the surface energy required to maintain the bubble's structure. The concept of excess pressure relates to the fact that the pressure inside a bubble is higher than the pressure outside. When a bubble forms, the liquid's surface tension acts as a binding force, trying to maintain the smallest possible surface area. The spherical shape is the most efficient way for the bubble to contain the excess pressure while experiencing the least amount of surface tension. As a result, the bubble adopts a spherical shape, allowing it to maintain its integrity with minimal energy expenditure. Finally, for the multiple-choice question, I would choose: * no These questions are not the same.

Don't worry, it's super simple and we'll walk through it step by step. So, let's get started! Step 1: Print Your Design on Your Computer First, ask a grown-up for help to find a design you like on the computer. It can be a pretty flower, a cute animal, or anything you want. Once you find your favorite design, ask them to print it off for you. Step 2: Get Your Sheer Fabric Ready Next, we need a special kind of fabric called \\"sheer fabric\\" for our project. This fabric is very light and a little see-through. Ask a grown-up if they have some sheer fabric you can use. If they don't have any, maybe you can go shopping with them to find some. Step 3: Put Your Fabric in an Embroidery Hoop Now it's time to use an embroidery hoop. It's a big round thing made of two circles that fit together. Ask a grown-up for help to put the sheer fabric inside the embroidery hoop. The fabric should be stretched tight like a drum. Step 4: Trace Your Design We're getting closer! Take the paper with your printed design and put it on a table or another flat surface. Carefully place the hoop with the sheer fabric on top of the paper, making sure you can see the design through the fabric. Now, using a pencil or a special fabric marker, carefully trace the design onto the sheer fabric. Don't worry if it's not perfect, we're just having fun! Step 5: Flip the Hoop When you're done tracing, flip the hoop over so that the fabric side is facing up. This will help make sure our design prints correctly. Step 6: Position the Screen Now we need a screen to print our design. Ask a grown-up for some help with this part. They'll need to put a special kind of ink or paint on the screen and then put the screen on top of the sheer fabric in the hoop. Make sure the screen lines up with the design you traced! Step 7: Pull Off the Screen and Let It Dry This is the most exciting part! Carefully lift the screen away from the fabric, and voilà! You've just printed a design on your sheer fabric! Now, we need to let it dry so the design stays in place. Ask a grown-up where to put your beautiful creation and how long it should dry. Conclusion: Great job! You've just learned how to print a design on sheer fabric using your computer, an embroidery hoop, and a screen. Now you can make all sorts of pretty decorations for your room or even share them with your friends. Keep practicing, little artists, and have fun creating!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Newly published research suggests working in an environment that offers little privacy can lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout . But personalizing one's workplace is an effective protection against such unwanted outcomes. \\"Individuals may take comfort from the items with which they surround themselves at work, and these items may help employees to keep emotional energy high in the face of stresses that come from their work,\\" writes a research team led by Gregory Laurence of the University of Michigan-Flint, Michigan, in north central U.S. In the Journal of Environmental Psychology, Laurence and his colleagues describe a study featuring 87 white-collar employees at a large, urban university in the Midwestern United States. Research assistants noted whether they worked in a private office (with a door that can be closed) or a cubicle. They also counted the number of items each worker had brought from home to decorate his or her workspace - a list that included photographs, posters, artworks. Not surprisingly, Laurence and his colleagues found a connection between the amount of privacy an employee enjoys and his or her rate of burnout. \\"High privacy conditions tend to serve as strong protectors against unwelcome interferences and distractions ,\\" they noted, \\"contributing to a work environment supporting reduced emotional exhaustion.\\" But this link disappeared when those employees had personalized their cubicles. Employees who had turned their workspaces into areas that reflect their interests and personalities reported the same (relatively low) level of emotional exhaustion, no matter whether they worked in an office or a cubicle. The research confirms \\"the calming effect\\" of having your own stuff... Options: A Job hunters. B Office workers. C Kid's parents D Employment researchers. Answer: B Office workers.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What happened when Khallad and Nashiri. first attempted an attack?\\" is \\"Their attempt failed\\"?","output":"Yes, according to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What happened when Khallad and Nashiri first attempted an attack?\\" is \\"Their attempt failed when the suicide boat sank.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, a pair of cheeky crooks took a far more relaxed  approach when breaking into a residency in China. They plonked themselves on the sofa and flicked on the homeowner's TV, helping themselves to delicious snacks while they were at it. Unfortunately for these foolish home invaders, they were immediately arrested after being spotted on a remote surveillance camera. The man of the house, 32-year-old Chung Chang, was at work when he randomly decided to check his security gear on account of a 'sixth-sense'. He watched absolutely stunned as two men casually wandered around his living room in the city of Linyi in eastern China's Shandong province, enjoying all the facilities on offer. The nerve of them! A pair of burglars sat on the sofa to snack and watch TV while invading a residency in China. 'When I saw these two men in my flat I was very confused,' Chung says. 'At first I thought they might be friends of my son, but when I called him he said he wasn't at home. 'My wife was away on a business trip so I knew they weren't her friends. 'Then I saw them putting on white gloves and looking through my things and I realised they were burglars. 'And they had the cheek to watch my TV and eat my crisps too!' Chung then called the police who went straight to the block of flats and knocked on the door. 'Sixth sense' - Fortunately the flat owner decided to check his security cam from work and spotted the intruders wandering around his living room. A police spokesman said: 'When officers arrived the men inside were clearly very surprised. 'We heard lots of swearing coming from the other side of the door and then it went quiet. 'The two men were found hiding under the owner's bed after police and club wielding security guards went inside. 'At first they said the flat was theirs, but when we asked them why they had been under the bed they realised the game was up and confessed.' The convicts, who had previously shared a jail cell and had only just been released, now face up to five years. Busted! The police were immediately called and the men were found hiding in the bedroom before they were taken away in handcuffs.

PUBLISHED:. 17:30 EST, 7 March 2014. |. UPDATED:. 17:30 EST, 7 March 2014. Prince Harry's endless optimism kept spirits high during the polar trek. Prince Harry has earned a few minutes of quiet reflection. And late last year, the fourth in line to the throne, whose life of royal and military duty rarely allows him a moment to himself, went to the ends of the earth to find them. Before Christmas he spent five weeks with a team of servicemen and women who had lost limbs to Taliban bombs in Afghanistan, marching more than 200 miles across the harshest and most inhospitable landscape on the planet in temperatures of -50C to the South Pole. Now the full story of this incredible trek is to be told in a two-part series starting next Sunday on ITV. 'This is one of the few places on earth that hasn't been screwed up by humans,' Harry muses. 'It's amazing, it's ridiculous that a place like this should exist. It's just nice to be out here with time to think about things, without being hassled. If you can't be free here, where can you be free?' But, as the series reveals, it was Harry's indomitable sense of fun that proved most invaluable to the party. It shows how HRH might just stand for Harry's Raucous Humour, as he teases team guide Conrad Dickinson about his Northumberland accent, joking, 'Our team is going to have one extra, a translator – so everyone can understand what you're talking about.' And his cheerful optimism in the face of horrendous weather kept spirits high. 'Minus 40... it's damn cold,' he smiles. 'This definitely wasn't the weather prediction.' Prince Harry takes the lead during his polar trek with wounded servicemen and women. The cheerfully dark humour of Royal Artillery officer Major Kate Philp matches his. 'We had half as many legs as the average Antarctic trek: just one per team member. The objective,' she tells me, 'was getting to the South Pole, and then returning home in one piece – or at least as much of one piece as we were in when we started! And we didn't dare miss the last flight home before Christmas. There were a few wives and families, not to mention the Queen, who would not have been happy.' Major Philp was the first British woman to lose a limb on active service, the victim of an IED (improvised explosive device) in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2008. She was joined by ex-RAF Regiment Sergeant Duncan Slater, who lost both legs in an IED blast in 2009, and Captain Guy Disney and Captain Ibrar Ali, who also both lost limbs on Afghan duty. Harry was worried that his fitness levels would let the team down. But the Prince started with a serious disadvantage – while the others had been training for the expedition for a year, he had not had that luxury. 'I'm a little bit anxious, nervous, all those things,' he admitted before they set out. 'I don't want to let the team down through fitness. There's a lot of pressure on everybody. My worries are that we'll push ourselves far too quickly. We'd never forgive ourselves if someone dropped out. 'It's about knowing exactly what you can and can't do. I'm terrified for myself, hugely daunted, so I can't imagine what it's going to be like for them. To take a double amputee to the Pole, it's going to be quite a moving moment when we get there. For me it's bigger than just these guys – we're trying to raise money but also trying to raise awareness that they're going to carry these injuries for the rest of their lives.' Prince Harry and Ivan Castro as they reach the South Pole. Harry poses for a photo at the South Pole. Weather conditions were awful and freak storms the previous winter had piled the snow into mounds and troughs. Even the all-weather support vehicles struggled – and the team had to do it with artificial limbs. 'For me it's bigger than just these guys –. we're trying to raise money but also trying to raise awareness that. they're going to carry these injuries for the rest of their lives.' For most of us it defies imagination. 'I knew it would be hard,' says Major Philp, 'but it was by far the hardest thing I've done. The physical exhaustion, and the mental challenge of looking at a white desert day after day – it takes its toll.' 'It wasn't easy,' says Sgt Slater, 'but the support we had made it possible. And a major part of that support came from Harry. He has a fantastic sense of humour, and he fitted right in. That's essential, because if the rest of us felt we didn't know how to speak to him, or if we were constantly worrying that he might find this or that remark offensive, it would burn up extra energy – energy you can't afford to lose. But we never thought, \\"We've got the fourth-in-line here, what are we supposed to be saying?\\" He wasn't like that, he was just brilliant.' Prince Harry during a kit weighing session. Major Philp agrees. 'He's a military man through and through, so with the shared military background it seemed a comfortable environment for him to be in. Harry got stuck in from the start: he made a great effort to get to know people, and he performed brilliantly on the trek. He was strong both physically and mentally, an incredibly valuable member of the team.' For Sgt Slater, the expedition was the fulfilment of a promise he made to himself during the darkest days after his injury, to seek out the biggest test he could find. His aim was to send a message: don't write us off. 'People see amputees and assume we won't be as capable as able-bodied people,' he says. 'They don't mean it unkindly, but it's a big obstacle when wounded ex-servicemen are looking for jobs. So this was about showing what we could do.' His goal now is to take his message into schools and businesses as an inspirational speaker. But the physical challenges are far from over. The team are training hard for this year's London marathon. And if Prince Harry should make a surprise last-minute decision to join them, he'll have his work cut out to keep up once more. Harry's South Pole Heroes, 16 March, 8pm, ITV.

Nisha Agrawal of Oxfam says there are: \\"two Indias, one rich, one impoverished\\" Article:","output":"Title: Danny Boyle's \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" Exposes the Dual Reality of Booming India – The Wealth Gap Crisis Introduction: \\"Slumdog Millionaire,\\" the critically acclaimed film by Danny Boyle, has shone a light on the harsh living conditions of the slum-dwellers in India and brought attention to the widening gap between the rich and the poor in the country. Amidst the massive economic growth, India has been home to four of the top eight billionaires on Forbes rich list. However, the newfound wealth seems to have bypassed the country's 456 million poor. Nisha Agrawal of Oxfam highlights the presence of \\"two Indias, one rich, one impoverished.\\" Exploring the Dual Reality of India: The colossal success and recognition of \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" on a global scale have laid bare the juxtaposition of two distinct worlds within India. On the one hand, the country boasts immense wealth with billionaires flourishing amidst a thriving economy. The economic expansion has led to substantial growth in various industries, including technology, retail, and real estate. On the other hand, India's immense growth has seemingly ignored the plight of its impoverished population. Approximately 456 million people in India are considered poor, living hand to mouth and striving to make ends meet. The striking disparity between the lives of the affluent and the underprivileged raises concerns about the equitable distribution of wealth and quality of life for all citizens in the country. Nisha Agrawal of Oxfam, an expert in the field of social inequality, emphasizes the stark distinction between these two realities. The existence of \\"two Indias\\" signifies that while abundant wealth is being generated, the fruits of economic progress are unevenly distributed. This inequity leads to a society where the prosperous few enjoy exorbitant benefits, while the impoverished many struggle to access basic necessities including clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. The Impact of \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" on an International Scale: Danny Boyle's film has had a profound impact on how India is viewed globally. By shedding light on the lives and struggles of those living in slums, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" has exposed the harsh realities that lie beneath the surface of India's abundant wealth. The film has generated discussions about social inequality and the urgent need to bridge the wealth gap. Furthermore, the film serves as a reminder that rapid economic growth, while much sought after, can lead to unintended consequences if not managed and distributed responsibly. Addressing the issue of wealth inequality requires concerted efforts to ensure that growth and development benefit everyone, not just the affluent among the population. Moving Forward: Addressing India's Wealth Gap Crisis \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" has forced conversations about India's wealth disparity and its impact on the country's populace into the mainstream. It is apparent that steps must be taken to close the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged. To achieve this, it is pertinent to focus on inclusive economic growth that addresses poverty and inequality, without leaving any stratum of society behind. Policymakers must focus on incorporating policies that promote fair distribution of resources and wealth. Initiatives such as quality education for all, social security nets, affordable healthcare, and skill development programs for the underprivileged will play crucial roles in achieving this goal. Furthermore, encouraging corporate social responsibility and emphasizing inclusive growth will contribute to bridging the gap between the two Indias. Conclusion: The unmasking of the dual reality of India through \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" presents an opportunity to acknowledge the wealth gap crisis and initiate impactful change. The challenge lies in channelling India's immense growth potential towards creating an inclusive society that ensures a good quality of life for all citizens, irrespective of their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is a task that requires the combined efforts of the government, private sector, civil society, and ordinary citizens to build a truly thriving and just India."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: It's not often that I find myself compelled to write a review, let alone a gushing one, but my experience at the delectable EatWell Cafe deserves every bit of praise I can muster! Upon stepping into this cozy, warmly lit haven in the bustling heart of the city, I was immediately swept off my feet by the attentive and friendly service, as well as the ambience that evoked a sense of joyful camaraderie amongst patrons. The captivating aroma wafting from the open kitchen promised a meal that was nothing short of exceptional, and I am pleased to report that it did not disappoint. My dining companion and I commenced our evening with the mouthwatering appetizer sampler, which consisted of a symphony of flavors and textures that left us craving more. The crispy fried oyster mushrooms were the epitome of a perfect appetizer – juicy and tender on the inside with a crisp and delicate outer layer, complete with a tangy dipping sauce that simply begged to be mopped up by the delightfully fresh garlic bread that graced our table. When it came to the main course, I opted for the pan-seared wild salmon in a velvety lemon beurre blanc sauce, while my dining partner chose the truffle-infused mushroom risotto that had earned rave reviews from our exceptionally knowledgeable server. The salmon was brought to the table expertly seared, its delicate flakes yielding to the gentlest prod of a fork. The sauce imparted a delicate zing of citrusy flavor, perfectly marrying the savory richness of the salmon. My dining companion's risotto was equally splendid – the creamy concoction was impeccably balanced with the earthy umami taste of truffle, giving the dish an almost ethereal quality that made every bite a celebration of culinary excellence. No meal would be complete without a sweet finale, and the dessert menu at EatWell Cafe encapsulated the essence of indulgence. I was torn between the rich chocolate lava cake and the tantalizing lemon meringue tart. Our server, with a twinkle in her eye, suggested we try both and share. She couldn't have made a better recommendation! The chocolate lava cake was intense in its richness, with the molten center providing a burst of unadulterated chocolate flavor that was nothing short of divine. The lemon meringue tart, on the other hand, offered a vibrant counterpoint with its tart lemon curd and light, gossamer-like meringue. The duo provided a consummate ending to a meal that showcased the talents of the culinary team at EatWell Cafe. As we reluctantly bid our evening adieu, with the lingering taste of extraordinary cuisine tempting us to stay, I marveled at the level of service we had experienced. The attentive staff – from host to server, and even the chefs themselves – had made us feel like valued guests within their welcoming abode. Their passion for exceptional food and warm hospitality transformed an ordinary night out into a memorable dining experience that I cannot wait to repeat. If you're seeking a culinary excursion brimming with exquisite flavors, stunning presentation, and attentive service, look no further than EatWell Cafe. I cannot recommend this gem of a restaurant highly enough, and I eagerly anticipate my return. Bon appétit!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is how native Germans speak.  Germans have visible tension in their mouth and pull their lips to the side when they pronounce words. Sometimes non-native speakers of German will hold their mouths too slack, especially their lower lips. Too loose of a lower lip, and you will not sound German. You will look like you’re chewing gum, and your accent will be obvious! When saying sit in German, it’s important that you understand that an “s” in German doesn’t sound like an English “s.”  When the letter “s” appears in front of a vowel, you need to pronounce the German consonant “s” like you would pronounce the English “z.” Thus, the “s” at the start of the word “sitzen” should be pronounced like an English “z.”   The German sound “z” is not voiced as strongly in German as it is in English, though. Be aware that the way you pronounce the letter “s” is different though when it appears at the end of a word instead of at the front. The sound at the end is a hissing sound of an “s.” That is also the case when a double “s” appears in the middle of a word. When the German letter “z” is in the middle of a word (as with sitzen), it is pronounced as an English “ts” sound.

Do you see that -92*f and +120*f? They're both talking about 'f', right? So, we can put them together just like you would with puzzle pieces. If we start with 120 pieces ('f's) and take away 92 pieces, that would leave us with 28 pieces (or in our case, 28 f's). So, that makes it 28*f - 44 = 68. We still need to solve for 'f'. But, now let's move 44 from one side to the other. Remember, if we take something away from one side, we need to add it to the other side. So, 28*f = 68 + 44. And when we add 68 and 44 together, we get 112. So now we have 28*f = 112. Now, do you remember sharing candies with your friends equally? Solving for 'f' here is like sharing 112 candies among 28 of your friends. I promise, it's not as hard as it sounds. You'd give each friend 4 candies until you run out of candies. So 'f' equals to 4.

Given the background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.  and the situation: Xi province started sustainable agriculture and permaculture 40 years ago, while Huan province still uses conventional methods of cultivation.  Animals grazing the fields extensively lead to desertification, the loss of carbon and nitrogen in the soil, and other problems. Permaculture was beneficial in Xi province, they re-built 10 inches of top soil in 10 years which is 6 times faster than the natural rate, which lead to a more diverse ecosystem and more biodiversity.  Answer the following question: Which province experienced less dust storms? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it is evident that the Xi province, which implemented sustainable agriculture and permaculture practices 40 years ago, experienced less dust storms in comparison to the Huan province that still utilizes conventional methods of cultivation. The implementation of permaculture and sustainable agriculture in Xi province contributed to rebuilding 10 inches of topsoil in 10 years, which is six times faster than the natural rate. This increased soil quality supported a more diverse ecosystem and improved biodiversity. These factors contributed to enhancing the stability and resilience of Xi province's ecosystem and, consequently, reduced susceptibility to dust storms. In comparison, Huan province's conventional cultivation practices, including excessive animal grazing, led to desertification, loss of carbon and nitrogen in the soil, and deterioration of land quality. The decreased biodiversity and poor soil quality made the ecosystem more vulnerable to potential disasters, such as dust storms. As mentioned in the background information, the frequency of dust storms increases due to land degradation. In conclusion, the Xi province, with its focus on sustainable agriculture and permaculture, experienced fewer dust storms compared to the Huan province, which continued to practice conventional cultivation methods. The positive impact of sustainable practices on the ecosystem's health and resilience demonstrates the importance of adopting environmentally-friendly approaches to agriculture and land management."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","output":"The Ferris wheel, a popular amusement park ride enjoyed by millions of people around the world, was invented by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. Born in Galesburg, Illinois, on February 14, 1859, Ferris showed an early interest in engineering and pursued studies at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, where he graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1881. Following graduation, Ferris made a name for himself as an engineer, working on various railroad and bridge projects in the United States. However, it wasn't until the early 1890s that Ferris began his foray into amusement rides. At the time, the United States was gearing up for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. This grand event was designed to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus arriving in the New World in 1492 and showcase numerous technological and architectural marvels from around the world. In preparation for the exposition, lead architect and planner Daniel Burnham sought a landmark attraction that could rival the Eiffel Tower, which had been unveiled at the Paris World's Fair in 1889. Ferris, inspired by the challenge, came up with the idea for the Ferris wheel. His vision was not just a regular amusement ride, but a colossal revolving observatory that could carry passengers up into the air, giving them a bird's eye view of the surrounding area while remaining secure and comfortable in enclosed cabins. Ferris drew up the plans for the wheel and presented them to committees in charge of the exposition. Despite facing initial skepticism, he eventually managed to secure approval and funding for the project. Construction began in late 1892, and Ferris collaborated with notable engineer William H. Boyington, who is best known for designing the iconic Chicago Water Tower, as well as companies such as the Bethlehem Iron Company and the St. Louis Bridge & Iron Company, which contributed to the development and fabrication of the Ferris wheel's components. The finished Ferris wheel debuted as the crown jewel of the Midway Plaisance, the entertainment hub of the exposition. Standing 264 feet (about 80 meters) tall, the wheel featured 36 enclosed cabins, each capable of accommodating up to 60 passengers for a total capacity of approximately 2,160 people. The Ferris wheel quickly became a sensation among visitors, with many dubbing it the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World\\" and praising Ferris for his remarkable achievement. Although the Ferris wheel was originally conceived for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, its popularity and influence spread across the globe. Even after the exposition, the wheel was disassembled and relocated twice, first to Chicago's North Side and then to St. Louis for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, before it was ultimately demolished in 1906. Ferris' revolutionary design lives on in numerous adaptations worldwide, and the Ferris wheel remains an enduring symbol of fun and innovation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and comes up with a plan in which Phyllis's husband will die an unlikely death, in this case being thrown from a train. Pacific All-Risk will therefore be required, by the \\"double indemnity\\" clause in the insurance policy, to pay the widow twice the normal amount.Keyes, a tenacious investigator, does not suspect foul play at first, but eventually concludes that the Dietrichson woman and an unknown accomplice must be behind the husband's death. He has no reason to be suspicious of Neff, someone he has worked with for quite some time and admires.Neff is not only worried about Keyes. The victim's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather), comes to him convinced that her stepmother, Phyllis is behind her father's death because her mother also died under suspicious circumstances when she was her nurse. Neff begins to care about what might happen to Lola, both of whose parents have been murdered. It is for this reason Phyllis wants her killed because she had suspected her of murdering her parents in the first place.Then he learns Phyllis is seeing Lola's boyfriend, Nino, behind his back. Trying to save himself and no longer caring about the money, Neff believes the only way out is to make the police think Phyllis and Lola's boyfriend... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Double Indemnity\\", Barton Keyes' occupation is a claims adjuster. He works for Pacific All-Risk, the same insurance company as the protagonist Walter Neff. Keyes is known for his tenacious investigative skills and plays a crucial role in uncovering the truth behind the murder plot that Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson plan in order to collect a double indemnity payout from an insurance policy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person to whom Reverend Issac Spencer was a close friend and patron? ?  The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical...

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - tennis racket - skill - competition - tennis court - legs Answer:","output":"While all of the options provided, including a tennis racket, skill, competition, a tennis court, and legs, play roles in playing tennis, the most significant requirement to be good at playing tennis is ‘skill.’ Skill encompasses a wide range of aspects and abilities that a tennis player must develop and perfect to excel in the game. Here are some of the key skills involved: 1. Technical Skills: This includes the basic techniques of playing tennis, such as the forehand, backhand, serve, volley, and smash. Each of these techniques requires precise footwork, racket handling, and body movement. The player needs to understand when to use which technique based on the nature and pace of the game.  2. Physical Fitness: Tennis requires high levels of physical fitness, specifically strength, agility, balance, coordination, and speed. Cardiovascular endurance is also crucial, considering that matches can last for several hours. Fitness training, both on and off the court, contributes significantly to a player's skill level.  3. Mental Strength: An often underrated aspect of tennis, the mental game, is crucial. Players need to have the ability to maintain concentration, remain composed under pressure, make tactical decisions quickly, and handle the emotional challenges that high-stakes matches can present.   4. Tactical Skills: Good tennis players have excellent tactical skills. This includes understanding their opponents' weaknesses, the ability to vary their game depending on situations, knowing where to position themselves on the court, and deciding when and how to attack or defend.  5. Consistency: Consistency in tennis is the ability to maintain a high standard of play throughout lengthy matches and tournaments. This aspect of the game relates closely to physical conditioning and mental stamina. 6. Adaptability: Each tennis match presents unique challenges in terms of opponents, playing conditions, and various other factors. A skilled player needs to quickly adapt their strategy based on these factors, demonstrating flexibility in their gameplay. In conclusion, to be good at tennis, one has to possess skills that extend beyond just having the right equipment, like a tennis racket, or the physical ability to run around the court (legs). Competition will certainly foster improvement, and a tennis court is naturally a requisite for play, but without sufficient skill across a variety of different areas – technical, physical, mental, tactical – it will be very challenging to excel in this sport."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods.

I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid.

Now, let's apply the background information: - A large log will burn relatively slowly due to its smaller surface area. - Small twigs or kindlings, wood chips, and sawdust will burn more quickly because they provide a greater surface area. Based on this information, Bill's fire, which used large logs, would burn slower. So, to answer the question: Tim is the friend who didn't make a fire that burned slower."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let them know that you respect their opinions. Encourage them to solve problems and conflicts on their own. Include them in your rule-making process.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Fostering Independence and Trust: A Guide to Parenting Teens Introduction: Parenting a teenager can be a challenging and rewarding experience. As teens navigate adolescence, they seek independence, identity, and self-discovery, all of which can pose significant challenges for parents. It's critical to create a balance between granting them the freedom they desire and ensuring they remain safe and responsible adults. With this in mind, this article will explore the importance of granting your teen privacy, respecting their opinions, encouraging independence in problem-solving, and involving them in the decision-making process. 1. Granting privacy: First and foremost, allow your teenager the privacy they desire. Teens require their space to explore new ideas, build relationships, and establish a sense of self. Respecting your teen's privacy shows that you trust their ability to make responsible decisions and allows them to develop independence. However, always be cautious of signs of trouble. Keep an open line of communication and be aware of drastic behavior changes, such as isolation, mood swings, or sudden disinterest in previously enjoyed activities. If you suspect something is amiss, engage in an open and honest conversation without breaching their privacy and offer support as needed. 2. Respecting opinions: As adolescents develop, they form their opinions and beliefs. Validate your teenager's opinions by engaging in open and respectful conversations about their views. This shows that you acknowledge their maturity and appreciate their unique perspectives. By doing so, you foster mutual respect between you and your teen, which strengthens your relationship and encourages open dialogue. 3. Encouraging independence in problem-solving: When your teenager faces a problem or conflict, it's essential to support them and allow them the opportunity to find solutions on their own. This type of experiential learning equips them with valuable life skills, enhances their confidence, and instills a sense of ownership for the outcome. By coaching them through the process instead of immediately stepping in to solve the issue, you provide a framework that develops their problem-solving capability. 4. Involving them in rule-making: To create a harmonious and respectful household, involve your teenager in the rule-making process. Engaging them in creating rules relevant to their daily lives instills responsibility, promotes open discussion, and ensures they understand and agree with the expectations set forth. Ally with your teen in drafting these rules; this collaboration can lead to a higher likelihood of adherence and foster an environment of understanding and respect. Conclusion: As your teen navigates the challenges and joys of adolescence, it's crucial to create an atmosphere of trust, respect, and independence. By granting privacy, valuing their opinions, guiding them through problem-solving, and involving them in the rule-making process, you foster a strong bond with your teenager and establish the foundations for responsible adulthood. As you form this delicate balance, always remember to keep communication open, flexible, and free from judgment. This enables your teenager to thrive in both their personal development and your relationship with them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As one of the world's largest and most significant trading centres, this extraordinary performance not only boosts confidence in the German economy, but also has reverberations around the globe. This text delves into the factors contributing to this meteoric rise, the companies benefiting the most, and the possible implications on both the domestic and international financial scene. Impressive Gains and Underlying Factors As global economies emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination efforts continue, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange has indeed hit yet another record high. This impressive surge can be attributed to a multitude of factors, including exceptional corporate earnings, significant levels of mergers and acquisitions, strong export demand, and a favourable outlook on the German market. Moreover, major central banks' commitment to keeping interest rates low has facilitated a surge in investments. With borrowing costs at historic lows, businesses are capitalizing on these opportunities to expand operations, ultimately leading to higher stock valuations. Key Players in the Record High Many renowned German companies have experienced this unprecedented growth, with shares skyrocketing in sectors ranging from automotive and financial to pharmaceutical and renewable energy. Key market players include: 1. Volkswagen AG: Amid ambitious plans for electrification and the launch of battery electric vehicles to rival Tesla, the automotive giant has seen substantial gains in their share price. 2. Deutsche Bank AG: This leading multinational banking institution has witnessed a remarkable recovery from past losses, with investors expressing renewed confidence. 3. SAP SE: As Europe's largest software company, SAP's impressive financial performance and strategy on cloud technology and business software solutions have further driven the stock's growth. 4. Siemens AG: With their focus on digitalization and innovative technological solutions, Siemens continues to make significant strides, consequently influencing stock demand. 5. Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA: As one of the largest dialysis service providers and manufacturers of medical equipment worldwide, this healthcare titan has also seen their stock valuation soar. Ripple Effects of Frankfurt's Record High This historic stock market performance has far-reaching implications for various spheres. Here are some key areas to consider: 1. Economic growth: A booming stock market often translates into increased economic growth, as thriving businesses generate wealth, create jobs, and improve overall socio-economic well-being. 2. Investor confidence: A record high naturally piques investors' interest, providing an inflow of external capital and bolstering the domestic economy. 3. Global impact: As home to numerous multinational corporations, Frankfurt's stock market success can have a domino effect on subsidiary companies and affiliate markets worldwide. 4. Public sentiments: A robust stock market positively impacts the general public's perception of their financial future, leading to increased consumer spending and optimism. Closing Thoughts As Frankfurt stocks hit yet another record high, it signals promising prospects for not just the German market but the global economy too. Understanding the contributing factors and their implications will be crucial in ensuring that businesses, investors, and governments adequately respond to and capitalize on the prevailing bullish market. While there is no guarantee that this meteoric rise will sustain indefinitely, it is undeniably an exciting time for those invested in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Answer the following question given this paragraph:   22.2 Structure of Prokaryotes Prokaryotes (domains Archaea and Bacteria) are single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus. They have a single piece of circular DNA in the nucleoid area of the cell. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall that lies outside the boundary of the plasma membrane. Some prokaryotes may have additional structures such as a capsule, flagella, and pili. Bacteria and Archaea differ in the lipid composition of their cell membranes and the characteristics of the cell wall. In archaeal membranes, phytanyl units, rather than fatty acids, are linked to glycerol. Some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers. The cell wall is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis. The chemical composition of cell walls varies between species. Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan. Archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan, but they may have pseudopeptidoglycan, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or protein-based cell walls. Bacteria can be divided into two major groups: Gram positive and Gram negative, based on the Gram stain reaction. Gram-positive organisms have a thick cell wall, together with teichoic acids. Gram-negative organisms have a thin cell wall and an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Very Hard Choices is a science - fiction / suspense - mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson , released in June 2008 . The novel , set in British Columbia , is a sequel to Very Bad Deaths and continues the story of the reclusive telepath known as Smelly .  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains.  British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds.  - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - Spider Robinson (born November 24, 1948) is an American-born Canadian Hugo Award- and Nebula Award-winning science fiction author.  - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.  - Very Bad Deaths (Baen Books, 2004, ISBN 0-7434-8861-X), is a science-fiction/suspense-mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson. The book was followed in 2008 by a sequel, \\"Very Hard Choices\\".

In science fiction, it emphasizes space opera, hard science fiction, and military science fiction. The company was established in 1983 by science fiction publisher and editor Jim Baen. After his death in 2006, he was succeeded as publisher by long-time executive editor Toni Weisskopf.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.

Information:  - The Talmud (Hebrew: ' \\"instruction, learning\\", from a root ' \\"teach, study\\") is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism. It is also traditionally referred to as, a Hebrew abbreviation of ', the \\"six orders\\", a reference to the six orders of the Mishnah. The term \\"Talmud\\" normally refers to the collection of writings named specifically the Babylonian Talmud \\"(Talmud Bavli)\\", although there is also an earlier collection known as the Jerusalem Talmud, or Palestinian Talmud\\"' \\"(Talmud Yerushalmi)\\". When referring to post-biblical periods, namely those of the creation of the Talmud, the Talmudic academies and the Babylonian exilarchate, Jewish sources use the term \\"Babylonia\\" long after it had become obsolete in geopolitical terms.  - Halakha (; also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, halachah or halocho) is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. It includes the 613 \\"mitzvot\\" (\\"commandments\\"), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic law and the customs and traditions compiled in the \\"Shulchan Aruch\\" (literally \\"Prepared Table\\", but more commonly known as the \\"Code of Jewish Law\\").  - According to Rabbinic Judaism, the Oral Torah or Oral Law (lit \\"Torah that is spoken\\") represents those laws, statutes, and legal interpretations that were not recorded in the Five Books of Moses, the \\"Written Torah\\" (lit. \\"Torah that is written\\"), but nonetheless are regarded by Orthodox Jews as prescriptive and co-given. This holistic Jewish code of conduct encompass a wide swath of ritual, worship, God-man and interpersonal relationships, from dietary laws to Sabbath and festival observance to marital relations, agricultural practices, and civil claims and damages.  - The Shulchan Aruch (, literally: \\"Set Table\\") also known by various Jewish communities but not all as \\"the Code of Jewish Law.\\" There are various legal codes in Judaism but the Shulchan Aruch is the most widely consulted. It was authored in Safed (today in Israel) by Yosef Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written.  - The Torah (\\"instruction, teaching\\"), or in Christianity, the Pentateuch (\\"five books\\"), is the central reference of the religious Judaic tradition. It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice. Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws (').  - Isaac ben Jacob Alfasi ha - Cohen ( 1013 - 1103 ) ( Hebrew :  '   , Arabic :   ) - also known as the Alfasi or by his Hebrew acronym Rif ( Rabbi Isaac al - Fasi ) , was a Algerian Talmudist and posek ( decider in matters of halakha - Jewish law ) . He is best known for his work of halakha , the legal code Sefer Ha - halachot , considered the first fundamental work in halakhic literature . He was born in the Algerian city Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad , but spent the majority of his career in Fes , and is therefore known as \`\` Alfasi '' ( \`\` of Fes '' in Arabic ) .  - Religious law refers to ethical and moral codes taught by religious traditions. Examples include Christian canon law, Islamic sharia, Jewish halakha, and Hindu law.  - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah. This title derives from the Hebrew word ' , meaning \\"My Master\\" (irregular plural ' ), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word \\"master\\" \\"\\" literally means \\"great one\\".    What entity does 'isaac alfasi' has the relation 'religion' with? Answer:","output":"Isaac Alfasi has a relation with the religion of Judaism. As an Algerian Talmudist and posek, his expertise and work in Jewish law, the Talmud, and halakha played a significant role within the Jewish religious tradition.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What contains an ornately carved fireplace? , can you please find it?   In comparison to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, is relatively small and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle, making extensive use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls. Crook suggested this provided some \\"spartan\\" relief before the culmination of the castle in Lady Bute's Bedroom but Floud considered the result \\"thin\\" and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers. The bedroom would have been impractical for regular use, lacking wardrobes and other storage.

Formation of magma in the Earth's mantle This step is essential because it explains the origin of the magma that eventually rises and initiates the volcanic process.  Here's the revised complete process with the missing step added: 1. Formation of magma in the Earth's mantle: Magma is formed by the partial melting of the Earth's mantle, typically due to a decrease in pressure, an increase in temperature, or the addition of water.      2. Magma rises: Magma rises towards the Earth's crust due to its lower density compared to the surrounding solid rock. 3. Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano: Magma collects and accumulates in reservoirs called magma chambers beneath a volcano. 4. Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill: As more magma fills the magma chambers, pressure increases, thus preparing the system for a possible eruption. 5. Gain energy for eruption: Magma gains enough energy in the form of heat and gas pressure to potentially cause an eruption. 6. Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes): As pressure builds, energy is released in the form of earthquakes, which scientists use to predict volcanic activity. 7. If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky, it will trap gases: This type of magma leads to a more explosive eruption due to the trapped gases creating additional pressure. 8. Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense: When the pressure created by the trapped gases becomes too much, a sudden, powerful eruption occurs. 9. If the magma is thin and runs: Thin and runny magma allows gases to escape more easily. 10. The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption: Since gases can escape, the eruption results in a more gentle flow of magma and a less violent eruption."},{"instruction":"\\"Department of Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics NTNU\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?","output":"The title \\"Department of Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics NTNU\\" belongs to the category \\"educational institution.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is STILL funny. I don't know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90's, but it helps if you do. In the 90's when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc). Also there were the wanna b's, accessible rappers that start making the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C&C Music Factory, etc). This movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like it's an actually documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff/director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott/Revenge of the Nerds, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial. Whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it. But, if you know 80's/90's rap, you know how much of this stuff is true. Still, on it's own, without hip hop knowledge, it is still a funny funny movie. And for all of those who ask, yes Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof movie either. This, in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways, better than Spinal Tap. As Spinal Tap is to heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is to Rap. And the songs are off the hook also. The DVD is chalk full of extras to include music videos of NWH as a group and as solo artists.

Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about the author? Options:  A. He/she is a chef  B.

I read this background article the other day: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]  I am facing a new situation today: The hospital in Y city had a good disposal site in which they disposed of Biomedical wastes, but the hospital in the neighboring city X had big problems, because the biomedical waste contaminated the ground water and affected the population.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city had less child mortality? The answer to this question is:","output":"City Y likely had less child mortality compared to City X. This assumption is based on the fact that City Y's hospital had a proper biomedical waste disposal site which minimizes the health hazards posed by improper waste management. In contrast, City X faced groundwater contamination due to the disposal of highly infectious biomedical waste, which directly impacts public health and sanitation. As mentioned in the background article, poor sanitation is correlated with higher child mortality rates, indicating that City X might have a higher number of child fatalities due to contaminated water and related health issues."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
