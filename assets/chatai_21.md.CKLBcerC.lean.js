What is the answer: The Gruesome Twosome are characters in which children’s tv cartoon series?","output":"The Gruesome Twosome, also known as the Gruesome Brothers, are characters in the children's animated television series \\"Wacky Races.\\" Created by Hanna-Barbera Productions, this iconic American cartoon series was originally broadcasted on CBS from September 14, 1968, to January 4, 1969, and it consisted of 17 episodes. The series is based on wacky characters participating in eccentric and crazy car races, with each episode featuring a new race. The Gruesome Twosome is a team comprising two creepy brothers named Big Gruesome and Little Gruesome. These sinister-looking siblings drive the racecar called the \\"Creepy Coupe,\\" which is car number 2 in the race. The Creepy Coupe is designed to resemble a haunted house on wheels, complete with a dragon, a belfry, and ghostly elements. The car even houses an array of supernatural and monstrous creatures that help them during the racing competition. Big Gruesome, the taller of the two, has a lanky frame, a prominent jaw, and wears a strapped aviator hat with goggles and torn clothes, displaying the typical image of a horror movie monster. Little Gruesome, as his name implies, is relatively smaller with a hunched back, red hair, a cap similar to Big Gruesome's, and wears tattered clothes. Being villains in the series, the Gruesome Twosome use various cunning tactics, schemes, and the assistance of their monsters to try and defeat their competitors. Alongside other eccentric racers in the series such as Penelope Pitstop, Dick Dastardly, and Muttley, the Gruesome Twosome add a spooky and distinctive element to the classic Wacky Races cartoon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A. breathe  B. experience sadness  C. forget nothing  D. remember everything  E. to get food  The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer is D. remember everything. The elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier because it is widely believed that elephants have excellent memories, often referred to as \\"an elephant never forgets.\\" This phrase stems from their natural ability to remember important events, individuals, and locations over a long period of time. In this context, the elephant was asked to recall a number to test and showcase its exceptional memory skills. Option A (breathe) is not an appropriate answer, as it is unrelated to memory or recalling numbers. Breathing is a vital, involuntary function performed by elephants and other living beings to maintain life. Option B (experience sadness) also doesn't explain why the elephant was asked to recall a number. Experiencing sadness is an emotional response and doesn't directly correlate with remembering specific information. Option C (forget nothing) is closely related to the best answer, as it addresses the elephant's apparent ability to retain information. However, it is an exaggeration to say that elephants forget nothing, as every living being has some limitations to their memory. Therefore, option D (remember everything) is a more suitable answer, as it captures the essence of the question without overstating the elephant's abilities. Option E (to get food) is not relevant to the context of remembering a number. While elephants need food to survive, recalling a number would not directly help them acquire sustenance. In conclusion, the elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier to demonstrate its impressive memory and to emphasize the popular belief that \\"an elephant never forgets.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Hunted Movie plot: Paul Racine, a computer-chip executive from New York, is on a business trip to Nagoya. He meets Kirina in the hotel lounge, and they have a one-night stand. Kirina is approached by Kinjo and two ninjas. Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, but Kinjo was not among them. The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving Kinjo motivation to kill Paul and Takeda. On the island, Paul spends time with the drunken blacksmith Oshima, who is constructing a sword for Takeda, and the old man teaches him about smithing and swordsmanship.

He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916.

Options: * different meanings. * the same meaning...Answer:","output":"* different meanings. In the first sentence, \\"meeting\\" means two people unexpectedly coming across each other on their way home from work. It's like two friends bumping into each other while walking home.  In the second sentence, \\"meeting\\" refers to a planned event or gathering, like a big group of people coming together to discuss and make decisions. This is more like a classroom or a conference where everyone knows they will meet. So, the word \\"meeting\\" has different meanings in the two sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: At age 61, identical twins Jeanne and Susan no longer look exactly alike. Susan smoked for many years and is an admitted sun worshipper, whose habits Jeanne does not share. A new study of twins suggests you can blame those coarse wrinkles, brown or pink spots on too much time in the sun, smoking, and being overweight. Because twins share genes, but may have different exposures to environmental factors, studying twins allows an \\"opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility ,\\" Dr. Elma D. Baron, at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, and his colleagues explain in the latest issue of Archives of Dermatology. Their analysis of environmental skin-damaging factors in 65 pairs of twins hints that skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors. But when it comes to skin cancer, the researchers say their findings support previous reports that both environment and genes affect skin cancer risk. Baron's team examined facial skin of 130 twins, 18 to 77 years old, who lived mostly in the northem Midwest and Eastern regions of the US, who were attending the Twins Days Festival in Ohio in August 2002. At this time, each of the twins also separately reported how their skin burned or tanned without sunscreen, their weight, and their history of skin cancer, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The study group consisted of 52 fraternal and 10 identical twin pairs, plus 3 pairs who were unsure of their twin status. From these data, the researchers noted strong ties, outside of twin status, between smoking, older age, and being overweight, and having facial skin with evidence of environmental damage. By contrast, sunscreen use and drinking alcohol appeared related to less skin damage. Baron and his colleagues say the current findings, which highlight ties between facial aging and potentially avoidable environmental factors--such as smoking, being overweight, and unprotected overexposure to the sun's damaging rays--may help motivate people to minimize these risky behaviors. Question: The passage is mainly concerned with    _    .

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.  Students in a chemistry class are performing experiments using two different compounds. The first compound, compound A, has a high number of hydrogen bonds between molecules of the compound. The second compound, compound B, has a low number of hydrogen bonds between the molecules of the compound. Aside from this difference, the molecular structure between the two compounds is similar.  Which compound will require less energy to undergo state changes? A:","output":"Compound B will require less energy to undergo state changes. Since it has a lower number of hydrogen bonds between its molecules compared to compound A, it will require less energy to separate the molecules from each other during changes of state, such as melting and boiling. Polar compounds with more hydrogen bonding, like compound A, typically have higher melting and boiling points due to the added energy needed to overcome these weak intermolecular forces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Five years ago, Roberto Rodriguez, 29, found himself in the midst of a horrifying tragedy and stayed silent, only to find closure as justice has finally been served. Darlene Haynes, the mother of his now five-year-old daughter, was brutally killed back in July 2009 when Julie Corey, posing as her friend, gruesomely carved out the unborn baby from her womb. Last week, Rodriguez saw the end of this horrific chapter in his life as his late partner's killer - and a former friend- Julie Corey, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison today. In a chilling and inexplainable act, Corey cruelly killed Darlene Haynes, and then attempted to pass off the 4lb premature baby girl as her own. However, her appalling deception came to an end when she was caught and apprehended two days later. In an exclusive interview, Rodriguez, the father of the now five-year-old girl, said, \\"If I told her how she had been born, what would she think?\\" He has kept silent about the atrocious murder all this time to protect his daughter, allowing her to live a life away from the heartrending situation that took place even before her birth. However, Rodriguez's silence in all these years also stems from the lingering accusations and claims that he, too, had some involvement with the murder of his child's mother. He laments, \\"I'll always be known as some scumbag, but I don't care now. The person who did this has got what they deserve.\\" The conviction of Julie Corey and her sentencing to life in prison offers the innocent and tormented father a chance to finally let go of the horrific past that seemed to haunt him. The devastating story of Roberto Rodriguez and the tragic birth of his daughter brings to light the cruelty people are capable of when it comes to betrayal. It underscores the importance of healing and overcoming the emotional trauma that comes with such experiences. As the years pass by, Rodriguez and his daughter will continue their journey to heal from the lingering effects of Darlene's gruesome murder. Thanks to the diligent work of investigators, jurors, and the legal system, the person responsible for robbing them of so much has now been held accountable. In conclusion, the heart-wrenching case of Darlene Haynes' murder serves as a reminder of the atrocities that unfortunate lives often have to endure. Roberto Rodriguez and his daughter's story is one of pain, sorrow, and the relentless pursuit of justice. With the killer now behind bars, the father and daughter can start afresh, remembering Darlene as the loving and caring woman she was, and focusing on the future together. As a community, it is crucial to acknowledge the bravery and resilience exhibited by Rodriguez and his daughter, lending support and understanding to those affected by such unspeakable horrors."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given an ambiguous question/query (which can be answered in more than one way) and a clarification statement to understand the query more precisely.

The film's prologue takes places in an area of rural farmland in Dannebrog, Nebraska. While there, Bob Irisen â a storm chaser with the National Weather Service â is driving down a country road to track a freak supercell thunderstorm. As a tornado touches down yards away, right as their daughter arrives home from school, Bob warns a family about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their cellar just before it destroys their farm.Meanwhile, in (the fictional town of) Blainsworth, Nebraska (the book is set in the real-world city of Grand Island),[1][2] teenager Dan Hatch, an aspiring and practicing artist who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather Jack to be an athlete, participates in a bike race and damages his bicycle; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bicycle, Danny and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Danny is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Danny and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Danny to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to a fill-in shift as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work.On the road, while continuing to track the massive storm creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southeast into Blainsworth, as the meteorologist he is radioing to is astonished at the uncharacteristic spring-like nature of the storm system for the fall; while there, he meets Laura and Jenny while getting some coffee at the diner. The action begins after Jack comes home at mid-evening; as he sits down to watch television, the show he is watching is interrupted by a severe weather bulletin reporting about a tornado sighting near Dannebrog, 14 miles (23Â km) northwest of Blainsworth. Several minutes after Jack leaves to check on his mother Belle, who is asleep in her rocking chair as he phones her, tornado sirens blare throughout town, only to cut off abruptly as Danny goes to get Ryan from his crib. The eerie stillness outside afterward suddenly gives way to a violent tornado that approaches Blainsworth's Capital Heights neighborhood, with the sucking noises emitting from the drains notifying Dan and Arthur of its pending arrival; they and Ryan take cover in the basement bathroom's shower as the twister starts to obliterate the Hatches' home.After Dan and Arthur escape from the basement of the leveled house through the collapsing floor beams where the first floor once stood, and look in awe of the rubble that was once the Hatch family's home, Arthur runs into Stacey and Ronnie Vae, who both survived the twister themselves in the Darlington's home (their parents were out of town on a trip back home to California at the time the storm hit). As Dan struggles to find his own family, Laura and Jenny are trapped inside the Salty Dawg, which also gets destroyed by one of the tornadoes. Dan and Stacey then go save Dan's grandmother, Belle, at her farm; the two teenagers find Belle underneath wooden boards blown onto her from off of the partially damaged barn near her house (which itself survived intact).As Dan and Stacey rush in the car to get Belle treated for her injuries, Dan finds Jack on a closed road, with his truck â which was overturned by the tornado, pinning him underneath it â covered in fallen power lines; he pulls Jack out from under the truck (with the help of emergency crews, after an earlier attempt by Dan and Stacey to push the truck in order to free him nearly injures Jack further), seeing this as an opportunity for his father to finally see him as reliable. However, Jack just gives a simple thank-you to the fact that Dan saved him from multiple dangers, even though his stepson may have been the only one down the road who was able to help him as it was blocked by policemen due to it being blocked by the downed lines, debris and broken underground utility lines. Later that night at the shelter, Dan reveals to Stacey that Jack is his stepfather and that his real father, Daniel Sr., was a pilot who was killed in a plane crash when Dan was 6. After telling her that he feels he isn't good enough in Jack's eyes and talks about the good qualities that his stepfather has, Stacey helps Dan consider that the two could try to find some common ground.Eventually, Jack â followed by Dan, who sneaks himself and Ryan into the station wagon loaned to Jack â leave the shelter to go and look for Laura. Just as Bob pulls his truck into the driveway of the destroyed house, helping passengers Jenny and Laura along with him searching for Jack, Dan and Ryan, Jack's station wagon also drives up and the family is reunited. As soon as everyone is relieved they survived the storm, three tornadoes touch down near them. Bob, realizing that there is no adequate shelter available, advises the group to make a run for it in their vehicles. The group narrowly escapes one of the twisters, which picks up a car that the Hatches' neighbors try to outrun the tornado in themselves, destroys several buildings in its path and hurls a tree branch into the windshield, briefly knocking Jack unconscious â causing Dan to take over driving the vehicle out of the storm's path. They, along with Bob and Jenny, make it to an overpass as the twister blows out the back window of the station wagon, nearly sucking Dan out before it dissipates into the air. As they walk out from under the overpass just as the sun rises on a clear day after the storm passes, Jack admits he's proud of Danny for not giving up in the face of adversity and trying to reunite the family.In the film's epilogue, illustrating what happened with the characters one year after the storm, Dan explains that he is now dating Stacey, while Arthur became class president, and Bob and Jenny got married and are becoming first-time parents to twins. He and Jack have also become closer, and Jack is now supportive of him. He also tells that his grandma, Belle, died the following year in 1997.","output":"1.

The reviewer seems to have mixed feelings about their overall experience at the restaurant, pointing out both positive and negative aspects of their meal. The dissatisfaction is evident in the reviewer's disappointment with the authenticity of the sushi, as they mention the unusual inclusion of lettuce in a roll and the garlic edamame's sauce not meeting their expectations. They also express discontent with their request for a specific dish being ignored or misunderstood, receiving a different roll than what they asked for. Additionally, the critique extends to the hot and sour soup's lack of spiciness, the taste being described as watered down. Despite these negative points, the reviewer does appreciate certain aspects of their meal, mentioning that the gyoza dipping sauce was good, and they enjoyed the miso soup, as well as the grilled chicken with rice being deemed as \\"ok\\". Furthermore, the reviewer encourages potential customers not to be discouraged by their experience, suggesting that there are other revolving sushi bars worth trying, specifically mentioning TEHARU as an example. They also acknowledge that the selections were limited, which could be a contributing factor to their overall dissatisfaction. In conclusion, the sentiment expressed in this review is mixed but leans more towards the negative side. The reviewer has identified some positive elements of their dining experience but also highlighted multiple areas where the restaurant could improve, including the authenticity and variety of the dishes being offered."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the right size: Pick a pot or pan that's big enough for the food you want to cook, so everything fits comfortably and cooks evenly. 2. Prepare the pot or pan: Before you start cooking, make sure the pot or pan is clean and dry. If you're using a non-stick pan, it might need a little oil or butter so the food doesn't stick. 3. Heat it up: Put the pot or pan on the stove, and set the heat to the right level. This will depend on what you're cooking, so follow the recipe for best results. Wait until it's nice and warm before adding your ingredients. 4. Add the food: Be careful when putting the food in the pot or pan, so you don't get splashed by hot oil or water. Use a spoon, spatula, or your fingers to gently place the food. 5. Stir and cook: Keep an eye on the food while it's cooking, and give it a little stir from time to time to make sure it cooks evenly. You might also need to adjust the heat up or down, depending on how fast it's cooking. 6. Tasty and safe: Make sure your food is cooked all the way through. This is important to keep our tummies happy and healthy! You can use a fork or knife to cut into the food and check if it's ready. 7. Clean up: Once you're done cooking, turn off the stove and move the pot or pan to a safe spot to cool down. When it's cooled, wash it with soapy water, rinse, and dry it, so it's all clean and ready for next time. Don't forget to clean the stove too if there are any spills or splatters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Input: look around right thrice and turn opposite left Output:","output":"To understand and solve the given command, let's break it down into individual parts and translate them into corresponding actions. 1. \\"look around right\\" - This means the agent should look around while turning right.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\". This panelled room was redecorated in 1841 for the visit... A:","output":"The Great Dining Room at Belton House was transformed into two different rooms throughout its history. First, it was transformed into a drawing room by James Wyatt in 1778. During this renovation, the Carolean decoration was removed, and the room was given a vaulted ceiling. The purpose of this transformation was to create a more welcoming and comfortable space for the family and their guests to relax and socialize. Later, in 1876, the room was transformed again, this time into a library. This change in usage allowed the room to house the estate's growing collection of books, which now amounts to approximately 6,000 volumes. The room became a testament to the family's passion for book collecting over 350 years, with nearly 2,300 books catalogued by Lord Tyrconnel in 1754 still remaining in the library today. Overall, these transformations of the Great Dining Room not only signify shifts in the trends and styles of the time but also highlight the changing functional requirements of Belton House's residents. The room has served as a versatile space within the mansion, adapting to various needs and preferences over the years, while always maintaining its status as an essential part of the home."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gaius Julius Caesar (; 12 or 13 July 100 BC - 15 March 44 BC), known by his cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Using the Latin alphabet of the period, which lacked the letters J and U, Caesar's name would be rendered GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR; the form CAIVS is also attested, using the older Roman representation of G by C. The standard abbreviation was C. IVLIVS CAESAR, reflecting the older spelling. (The letterform AE is a ligature of the letters A and E, and is often used in Latin inscriptions to save space.)  In Classical Latin, it was pronounced ['ga:.i.Us 'ju:l.i.Us 'kaesar]. In the days of the late Roman Republic, many historical writings were done in Greek, a language most educated Romans studied. Young wealthy Roman boys were often taught by Greek slaves and sometimes sent to Athens for advanced training, as was Caesar's principal assassin, Brutus. In Greek, during Caesar's time, his family name was written Kaisar (Kaisar), reflecting its contemporary pronunciation. Thus, his name is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the German Kaiser.  In Vulgar Latin, the original diphthong [ae] first began to be pronounced as a simple long vowel [e:]. Then, the plosive /k/ before front vowels began, due to palatalization, to be pronounced as an affricate, hence renderings like ['tSe:sar] in Italian and ['tse:zar] in German regional pronunciations of Latin, as well as the title of Tsar. With the evolution of the Romance languages, the affricate [ts] became a fricative [s] (thus, ['se:sar]) in many regional pronunciations, including the French one, from which the modern English pronunciation is derived. The original /k/ is preserved in Norse mythology, where he is manifested as the legendary king Kjarr.  Caesar's cognomen itself became a title; it was promulgated by the Bible, which contains the famous verse \\"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's\\". The title became Kaiser in German and Tsar or Czar in the Slavic languages. The last Tsar in nominal power was Simeon II of Bulgaria, whose reign ended in 1946. This means that for two thousand years after Julius Caesar's assassination, there was at least one head of state bearing his name.

However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid. The characters were engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying. Most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are picture perfect and believable. I like how Emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which sample would have higher boiling point, sample A or sample C?  Hint: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. A:","output":"Given the information provided, sample C, the cyclic molecule, would have a higher boiling point than sample A, the straight-chain molecule. This is because cyclic molecules generally have higher boiling and melting points compared to straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. The reason for this difference in boiling points lies in the molecular structure and the strength of the intermolecular forces present. In cyclic molecules, the ring structure contributes to stronger intermolecular forces, making it more difficult to break these forces and transition to the gas phase, resulting in a higher boiling point."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Our main characters are Alex, a charismatic and intelligent college student studying quantum physics, and Dr. Valerie Thompson, a brilliant, yet somewhat maverick scientist, and inventor of a time-travel machine. Step 2: Introduce a goal. Alex learns about a historical event that took place in 1986, which negatively impacted the lives of his parents and many others. He believes that if he can go back in time and prevent that event from happening, he can change their lives for the better. Step 3: Demonstrate the potential for time travel. Dr. Thompson reveals her time-travel machine to Alex, which she has successfully tested on small objects, but hadn't dared to use on a human yet. Alex convinces her to let him use the machine for his mission, arguing that the potential benefits are too great not to try. Step 4: Go back in time. With Dr. Thompson's guidance, Alex activates the machine, and the pair are transported back to the year 1986. Step 5: Introduce conflict. When they arrive, they quickly learn that the event they want to prevent is more complicated than they initially thought. The people involved are more deeply connected, and the consequences of changing the past become increasingly unclear. Alex and Dr. Thompson have to navigate the challenges of creating a new timeline without causing irreparable damage to the future. Additionally, they have a limited amount of time to complete their mission, as the time-travel machine can only sustain their presence in 1986 for 24 hours. Step 6: Build relationships and character development. While working together on their mission, Alex and Dr. Thompson form a strong bond. Dr. Thompson learns to embrace the unpredictable, while Alex gains a deeper understanding of the complexities of time-travel and the importance of accepting the natural course of events. Alex also learns more about his parents and their past, making him appreciate the life they've given him even more. Step 7: Climax. In a high-stakes scenario, Alex and Dr. Thompson successfully prevent the event, but with a bittersweet twist; they realize that regardless of their efforts, some things cannot be completely changed. The experience, however, helps them grow as individuals and learn valuable life lessons. Step 8: Return to the present. Dr. Thompson and Alex return to the present, finding that they have indeed changed the course of history, but in unexpected ways. They've learned that they must accept the past for what it is, focusing on the present and future to create the best possible outcomes. Step 9: Reveal the consequences of their actions. The movie ends with Alex and Dr. Thompson facing the consequences of their time-traveling escapade, both good and bad. They face personal challenges and revelations as they work together to continue their research and improve the time-travel technology, with the hope of finding a balance between their newfound understanding of its powers and their ethical responsibilities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Background: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred.  Paragraph: Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather. While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island had fewer birds with bigger beaks reproduce? Answer:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, Bank island experienced severe drought, which led to a diminished food supply on the island. In this situation, it is important to consider the effect of the drought on the finch population, as described in the background information provided. During the drought in the Galápagos, the availability of seeds decreased, with smaller seeds being less available for birds to eat. Birds with larger beaks had an advantage here, as they were able to crack open and consume seeds of all sizes. Consequently, birds with smaller beaks struggled to find enough food to survive, and many died as a result. The larger-beaked birds, on the other hand, were able to continue finding food, thereby surviving and reproducing. As a result of these selective pressures, the average beak size in the finch population increased, indicating evolution by natural selection. In light of this background information, we can infer that Bank island, which experienced the severe drought, would have had fewer birds with smaller beaks survive and reproduce. The larger-beaked bird population, however, would have likely thrived due to their ability to consume a wider variety of seeds. Consequently, there would have been an increase in the number of birds with larger beaks reproducing on Bank island. On the contrary, Port island experienced wet weather over the past three summers. This suggests that the food supply on the island remained stable, as wetter conditions typically promote the growth of plants and, consequently, the production of seeds. Thus, it can be inferred that Port island would have had fewer birds with larger beaks reproduce compared to Bank island. In conclusion, given the circumstances mentioned in the paragraph, Port island had fewer birds with bigger beaks reproduce compared to Bank island. The severe drought on Bank island created an environment where birds with larger beaks had a significant advantage, allowing them to survive, reproduce, and contribute to the increase in average beak size in the finch population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick, and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction. However, the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected, and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the World War II era Army. The recognizable cast is hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams faring best. Stephen Boyd, however, stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn. The obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values. The locations are great, the effects and action are weak. Imagine if \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way Vin Diesel's Caparzo had (except we do get to see the shot because they effects can't handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns drove around in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. Yet, the denouement, with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black, and Boyd's racist Captain being effected by this, is compelling, as are the sequences of of Turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines.

Sentence 1 seems conversational with hesitation and corrections \\"you know it's it's\\", \\"and the and and that\\". It looks like someone is speaking spontaneously, perhaps in a casual or informal setting. It doesn't seem like a formal government document or a letter, definitely not connected to 9/11 or travel. It's not verbatim as verbatim would mean that it's a written record of dictated or recorded speech, and this has many conversational markers. Fiction also seems unlikely because of the conversational informality. This kind of spontaneous talk is typical of face-to-face conversations. So the first one might be 1. FACE-TO-FACE. Sentence 2, on the other hand, is much more structured and coherent, suggesting it might be written or pre-prepared speech, but it still doesn't appear to align with most of our options. The subject is still government, but the way it is delivered does not give us a clear match. It doesn't seem like a telephone conversation. It's not specific to travel or fiction. It seems to be discussing press coverage of an issue, which suggests journalism, and thus the closest match here might be 5. SLATE, which is an online magazine that covers current affairs, politics.

They proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess. At the gathering for her christening she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the young son of King Hubert, Stefan's friend, so that their kingdoms will always be united. Among the guests are three good fairies: Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who have come to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their blessings (beauty and song, respectively). Just before Merryweather can speak, the evil fairy Maleficent appears. Angered upon not being invited to the christening, Maleficent curses the princess, proclaiming that before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of an enchanted spinning wheel and die. After Maleficent leaves, Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse so that Aurora instead will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's first kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they take Aurora away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest, living as mortals, until the day of her sixteenth birthday.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Mr Assad also criticised the US-led coalition and its air strikes in Syria and Iraq as counter-productive, saying that terrorism had only spread. Meanwhile, Russia has carried out more air strikes in Syria it says targeted so-called Islamic State (IS) positions. Syrian activists say the raids appear to have focused on other rebel groups. In an interview with Iranian state television, reported by the Syrian presidency Twitter feed, President Assad said Syria, Russia, Iran and Iraq were united in battling terrorism and would achieve \\"practical results\\", unlike the US-led coalition. Mr Assad's international opponents say a negotiated solution to Syria's four-year-old civil war must involve the president stepping down, although some Western nations now say he could remain during a transitional period. But Mr Assad insisted: \\"Discussion about the political system or officials in Syria is an internal Syrian affair.\\" Where key countries stand - Who is backing whom Why? What? How? - Five things you need to know about Russia's involvement What can Russia's air force do? - The US-led coalition has failed to destroy IS. Can Russia do any better? Inside an air strike - Activist describes \\"frightening Russian air strike\\" Syria's civil war explained - Analysis and background on the conflict Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday that its aircraft had bombed 10 IS targets in Syria over the past 24 hours - including command posts, a training camp, ammunition stores and a workshop making explosive devices including suicide belts. It said its air campaign, which began on Wednesday, was being expanded. \\"As a result of our air strikes on Isil [IS] targets, we have managed to disrupt their control system, the terrorist organisation's supply lines, and also caused significant damage to the infrastructure used to prepare acts of terror,\\" the ministry added. Syrian activists said Russian strikes in central Homs province had killed at least two children and a shepherd, and wounded a further 15 people. The Syrian authorities have reportedly detained a prominent opposition figure, days after he criticised the Russian air strikes. Munzer Khaddam, spokesman for the National Co-ordination Committee for Democratic Change, was held at a checkpoint near the capital Damascus, an official from his group told AFP news agency. Turkey and Britain have condemned Russia's military intervention in support of President Assad. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described it as a grave mistake that would further isolate Moscow. In London, Prime Minister David Cameron said Russia's actions would lead to further radicalisation and terrorism. \\"Tragically, what has happened is that most of the Russian air strikes, as far as we have been able to see so far, have been in parts of Syria not controlled by Isil (IS) but controlled by other opponents to the regime. \\"So what is happening is that they are backing the butcher Assad, which is a terrible mistake for them and for the world; it's going to make the region more unstable, it will lead to further radicalisation and increased terrorism. \\"And I would say to them: change direction, join us in attacking Isil but recognise that if we want to have a secure region, we need an alternative leader to Assad. He can't unite the Syrian people.\\" The US-led coalition carried out 16 air strikes against IS militants, weapons and buildings in Syria and Iraq on Saturday, according to a US military statement. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that four years on has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, as well as less numerous so-called \\"moderate\\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. What's the human cost? More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.

President Assad has said that Syria, Russia, Iran, and Iraq are working together to fight against terrorism.

Definition: In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Input: To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart. Though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well. Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. Scottland is still run by English nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. There are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor. He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. One of them, known as Archibald Cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. Played wonderfully by Tim Roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother. This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. He rapes Macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Along with another crony of the Marquis (Brian Cox) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt. This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.Spoilers ahead!!!!!Luckily for the MacGregor's, a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. And for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. The first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. The score is quite memorable, too. The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor. The film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy.

Read this: In 1607, English Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke said in the Case of Prohibitions (according to his own report) \\"that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, quod Rex non debed esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.).\\" Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Who spoke about the rule of law in sixteenth century England?","output":"The person who spoke about the rule of law in the sixteenth century England was Sir Edward Coke. He was a prominent English lawyer, judge, and politician during this time period. In 1607, he served as the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, one of the highest judicial roles in England. Sir Edward Coke is particularly renowned for his development and promotion of the English Common Law—the body of legal norms, rules, and standards that were created by the judiciary through the decisions made in the courts. This system of law has had a profound influence on the legal systems of many countries throughout the English-speaking world, including the United States. His views on the rule of law were famously encapsulated in the Case of Prohibitions in 1607. In his statement, Sir Edward asserted the primacy of the law as the ultimate metric and standard to resolve disputes among subjects—that \\"the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects.\\" Moreover, he underlined that the law safeguarded the monarch himself, ensuring his security and peaceful reign. However, his assertion did not please the King, who took offence at the notion that he too was subject to the law. The King considered this assertion to be treasonous. In response, Sir Edward referred to the works of the medieval jurist Henry de Bracton, noting \\"quod Rex non debed esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege\\" translated as \\"That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.\\" Coke's stand against the King's viewpoint, rooted in the concept of absolute monarchy, signaled a critical shift in the legal and political history of England towards constitutionalism—the idea that government authority is derived from and limited by a constitution. Notably, the rule of law is a foundation principle of modern democracies, ensuring that all individuals and institutions, including the government and the head of state, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated. The philosophical seeds for this essential democratic concept were sown by influential jurists like Sir Edward Coke, who argued for the supremacy of the law—even over the King—during the sixteenth century England."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bio: john p. \`\` jack '' walker was an australian rules footballer who played with st kilda in the victorian football league . he was killed while on active service during world war i. The answer to this question is:","output":"From the given bio of Jack P. Walker, several details can be gathered regarding his personal life, professional career, and his involvement in World War I.  1. Personal Life and Name: John P. Walker was an Australian man, commonly referred to by his nickname \\"Jack.\\" The use of two names suggests that he might have been a casual and friendly individual, as nicknames often signify familiarity and ease in social interactions. 2. Professional Career: Jack P. Walker was an Australian Rules footballer, which means he played the sport, also known as Aussie Rules or simply Football, that combines elements of rugby and soccer with additional unique features. This sport is especially popular in the Australian states of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. It is known for its fast pace, athleticism, and hard-hitting nature. As a footballer for St. Kilda, Jack must have had the athletic prowess and skillset necessary to compete at a professional level. 3. Team Affiliation: Jack played for St. Kilda, a professional Australian Rules football team based in Melbourne. St. Kilda Football Club is a member of the Victorian Football League (VFL), now known as the Australian Football League (AFL) since 1990. The VFL/AFL is the highest level of professional Australian Rules football, indicating that Jack was playing at the top tier of his sport. St Kilda is one of the oldest clubs in the league, founded in 1873, and the club's history suggests that Jack would have been a part of a rich football tradition. 4. World War I Service: Jack P. Walker served in World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918. His participation in the war shows his patriotism and commitment to the defense of his country. As an Australian, he likely enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) or the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF), the primary forces deployed by the Australian government during WWI. 5. Death: Tragically, Jack P. Walker was killed while on active service during World War I. This means that he likely died on the battlefield or as a direct result of military action. His death highlights the immense sacrifices made by many young men during this great global conflict, as well as the impact it had on communities and sports teams back home. Thousands of Australian soldiers lost their lives during World War I, and their stories, like Jack's, remain testament to their bravery and dedication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Reserve Bank of Australia) When the new 5 bank note comes into circulation tomorrow, it will contain a small but hugely important new design feature – making it the first Australian bank note that the visually impaired can read. The inclusion of two raised dots, the size of a “hundreds and thousands” sprinkle, on each of the long sides of the new note are thanks in part to the advocacy of NSW teenager Connor McLeod and his mother Ally Lancaster, who in 2012 began a petition for tactile markings to be included on the reprint of banknotes. \\"We have braille on toilets, we have tactile features on bus stops, but we don't have it on our national currency, and that is something we use every day,\\" Connor's mother Ally Lancaster told AAP. Vision Australia's lead policy advisor Bruce Maguire said the note will give those who are blind or vision-impaired the ability to identify currency accurately and confidently for the first time. NSW teenager Connor McLeod started petitioning the Reserve Bank at age 12 to introduce tactile banknotes so vision impaired and blind people could tell the value of notes. (AAP) \\"I think the introduction of the tactile feature on banknotes is the biggest inclusive effort that I have seen in my lifetime,\\" he said. \\"None of us who are blind have been able to identify notes accurately by touch before and that is something that everybody takes for granted.\\" Over time, all Australian bank notes will have the tactile feature, each with a different number of raised dots in accordance to the denomination.

The townsfolk went about their business, casting surreptitious glances at the imposing gallows, which had been hastily erected in the town square. Mace Bishop, a rugged man with piercing blue eyes and a determination that set his jaw firm, rode into town on his trusted horse Thunder. He had come to Val Verde with one goal in mind: to free his brother, Dee, from the hangman's noose.  Dee and his gang were notorious in the region for their reckless lifestyle, and they recently found themselves in hot water after a daring bank heist that went terribly wrong. The Val Verde Savings and Trust Bank was not an easy target, but their greed and arrogance led them to believe they were invincible. In the aftermath of the robbery, Dee and several members of his gang were captured by the local authorities. As news spread, families of the victims demanded justice, and a public execution was the only way to restore order in the shaken town. One of the townsfolk, Maria Stoner, had a particularly bitter reason to see Dee and his gang hanged. During the botched bank robbery, her beloved husband, one of the bank's tellers, had been shot and killed by Babe Jenkins, a ruthless gang member who valued money above human life. Maria's once gentle and compassionate eyes were now clouded with hatred and pain. Having heard of the gang's capture, Mace was determined to save Dee, knowing full well the cost of his actions and the chances of success were slim. He felt a deep sense of responsibility for his brother and couldn't shake the guilt of having left him at a young age, which he believed led Dee down this dark path. Leaving the jail, Dee's gang had split up in search of refuge, leaving a maelstrom of chaos and confusion in their wake. With the scent of blood now fresh in their nostrils, a posse of lawmen had been assembled to track down the remaining fugitives. Their pursuit took on an almost mythical quality, with tales of their tireless search for the scattered gang members spreading far and wide. At the head of the posse, local sheriff July Johnson and his steadfast deputy, Roscoe Bookbinder, valiantly led the chase. Both men had their own motivations to apprehend the gang. The sheriff had his own ambition to see law and order restored in Val Verde, while Roscoe Bookbinder desired retribution for the death of his cousin who was caught in the crossfire of the gang's crimes. Their relentless pursuit led them across the Mexican border into territory policed by bandoleros - ruthless outlaws who showed no mercy to the unwary traveler. The rocky terrain proved challenging and treacherous, and the dry desert air left many a man parched and exhausted. As the posse pushed deeper into unknown lands, their horses taking strained steps under the scorching sun, their determination to bring the fugitives to justice never wavered. Back in Val Verde, Mace Bishop devised a daring plan to rescue Dee from the gallows before the noose could seal his fate. Unbeknownst to him, Maria Stoner, driven by vengeance and weighed down by the burden of her own loss, would become a vital piece of the puzzle in an intricate game that would unfold in the heart of a lawless land. As the sun rose on a fateful day, Mace, the posse, and all involved in the tragic story of Dee's gang were set to collide in a whirlwind of vengeance and brotherly love. The dusty streets of Val Verde would play witness not just to a public execution, but to a breathtaking climax of a tale that would leave the town, much like the lives of the people living in it, forever changed. The chase across the Mexican border would not be an easy one, as the posse, led by the unyielding Sheriff Johnson and the fearless Deputy Bookbinder, would face not just the unforgiving desert, but the untamed bandoleros, who led a life of crime and violence.  In the end, the story of Mace Bishop, Dee, and the posse would go down in the annals of history as a bittersweet tale of redemption, justice, and the unbreakable bonds of family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite Control and Smiley's misgivings, their successors had already begun a secret operationâ\\"Witchcraft\\"âto obtain Soviet intelligence, which is being exchanged with the CIA for US intelligence. Smiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, a British spy, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in the Circus, as Control had suspected. Smiley chooses a trustworthy agent, Peter Guillam, and retired Special Branch officer Mendel to help him. He interviews Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after deducing that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attachÃ© in London, was a spy. Tarr tells Smiley that, on a mission to Istanbul, he had had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus, but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him and ordered him straight home, whereas Moscow immediately kidnapped Irina. Tarr concluded that the mole had intercepted his message, and went into hiding, suspected of defecting and murdering the British station chief. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true. Smiley interviews Prideaux, who after brutal interrogation was exchanged by the Soviets but sacked from the service.

Title: extremely disappointing Review: This movie is long and drawn out, and after sticking it out to the end it was a very unrewarding finale. The film does not work as a love story, mainly because (as one other reviewer said,) the English man is so stiff and non-passionate. I could not understand what she saw in him. As a character study it doesn't work either. Her character is inconsistent - at times innocent and ethereal, at times totally erotic and conniving. As a supernatural movie, well, it totally sucked.

The grass at the Augusta Country Club is cut to 4 inches. Sam likes more of a challenge when playing golf but Jack likes to play on turf where the ball rolls easier.  But I can use this background: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot.  What is an answer for this question: Which Country Club would Jack enjoy playing golf at more, Aurora or Augusta? Answer:","output":"Jack would most likely enjoy playing golf more at the Aurora Country Club. Since the grass is cut to 2 1/2 inches high, it will make the ball roll easier, which is Jack's preference.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics? ?  The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\".

Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona.

Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums.

În primul rând, mecanismele de monitorizare și evaluare ale SAP nu sunt întotdeauna eficiente sau transparente. Aceasta face ca progresul înregistrat de țările candidate să fie greu de măsurat și evaluat, ceea ce la rândul său poate duce la stagnarea reformelor și la întârzieri în desfășurarea negocierilor de aderare. În al doilea rând, condiționalitatea impusă de SAP în ceea ce privește reformele politice, economice și juridice este adesea considerată excesiv de strictă și inflexibilă. Acest lucru poate duce la dificultăți în implementarea reformelor necesare în țările candidate, în special în contextul unor societăți și instituții fragile, afectate de conflicte sau de corupție endemică. În al treilea rând, resursele financiare și tehnice disponibile prin SAP sunt adesea insuficiente pentru a sprijini în mod adecvat procesul de reformă în țările candidate. Acest lucru poate rezulta în incapacitatea acestora de a aborda provocările complexe legate de dezvoltarea economică, reducerea sărăciei, consolidarea statului de drept și protejarea drepturilor omului.

The film opens with several dynamite blasts to break up the ice that's clogging up the deep-sea drilling rigs.  Disappointingly to the company, the drilling rig produces no oil. Baldwin is then picked up from work by an airplane flown by his wife Claudia. On the way home, Claudia tells Michael that she wants to move the kids back to Los Angeles where they can live in a more civilized environment. Michael argues that he cannot just walk away from the exploration since it was his idea. Upon arriving home, Michael and Claudia must deal with their three children arguing with each other about the existence of Santa Claus. To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results. The next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus's chief elf Ed. Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves.  He explains that while their activities at \\"Site A\\", their primary drilling area, are causing extensive damage, any blasts at their secondary site, known as \\"Site B\\", would destroy North Pole City due to the greater proximity of the dynamite blasts.

Based in Germany during the First World War he enrolled in the German Army as an officer in 1916, serving until the armistice. He would later claim that the war had been the death of old Europe and argued that one of its main positives was that it had \\"rescued our nation from the deadly, slimy embrace of a lothsome cuttlefish\\" in reference to Russia.

You'll also need an old toothbrush or a soft scrubbing brush, and a cloth or towel to help dry. 1. Mix a little bit of soap with some water in a small bowl to make a cleaning solution. 2.

Now for the second question, \\"What are great ways to clean white sneakers?\\" This is similar to the first question, but it asks for more ideas. The method I already shared is one way, but other people might use magic erasers, baking soda and vinegar, or even toothpaste to clean white sneakers. Both questions want to know how to clean white sneakers, but the first one talks about the sides while the other one wants different ways.

Wir teilen jedoch die im Entschließungsantrag im Hinblick auf Biokraftstoffe getroffene Aussage, dass die hohen Lebensmittelpreise Auswirkungen auf den Vertriebssektor sowie auf die Sicherheit in der Nahrungsmittelversorgung in der Welt haben. Translate to English","output":"\\"However, we share the statement made in the resolution proposal regarding biofuels, that high food prices have implications on the distribution sector as well as on food supply security worldwide.\\" This German statement implies a concern about the impact of biofuels on global food pricing and distribution. Biofuels are a type of energy derived from biological materials, often crops such as corn or sugar cane. Because these crops are also a source of food, the production of biofuels can drive up the prices of these crops by increasing demand. This dynamic makes it more expensive for people to purchase these foods, which in turn can contribute to food insecurity, or a lack of consistent access to sufficient food. Furthermore, the rise in food prices can also have an impact on the distribution sector. This sector, which includes businesses that move goods from producers to consumers, may have to increase prices to cope with higher food costs. This increase in prices can add a financial burden to consumers and potentially limit access to other goods or services. In a global context, these impacts can be particularly devastating in regions where poverty levels are high and food insecurity is already a major concern. These areas may be dependent on more developed regions for food imports, and if the prices of these imports increase due to the production of biofuels, it can exacerbate their existing struggles with food insecurity. The resolution proposal mentioned in this statement likely refers to a formal decision or recommendation by a governing body or organization. If this governing body agrees with the concerns outlined, they would be indicating that they believe current biofuel production methods may be negatively affecting worldwide food distribution and security, and that they are in favor of implementing changes to mitigate these impacts.  These changes could potentially include implementing more sustainable farming practices, investing in new technology to make biofuel production more efficient and less reliant on food crops, or implementing regulatory measures to control the impact of biofuel production on food prices. By adopting such measures, it is hoped that the effects of biofuels on food prices and distribution can be managed in a way that takes into account both the need for sustainable energy sources and the necessity of maintaining global food security."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two U.S. filmmakers were injured Saturday when their small plane crashed into a three-story residential building in downtown Nairobi. People gather around the wreckage of a plane that struck a building in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Saturday. Dan Parris, 25, and Rob Lehr, 26, both from St. Louis, Missouri, were shooting an independent documentary on poverty in Africa. Both men were hospitalized and expected to survive, according to David Peterka, who was part of the film crew, but was not aboard the plane. He said that all four aboard the plane were Americans. A flight engineer, whose name was not released, was critically injured and was in a coma, Peterka said. The pilot, whose name has not yet been released, was killed in the crash. The crew had been in the east African nation for four days and was shooting video of Kibera, one of the largest slums in Africa. The plane was headed to nearby Wilson Airport, where most light aircraft land in the Kenyan capital. \\"The pilot had warned that he was going to hover and go slow,\\" Peterka said. \\"They were surprised when they went to about 50 feet off the ground --- and then they hit electrical lines and the plane flipped into the building.\\" Just before the plane crashed, the listening devices went off and they could not communicate with the pilot, Peterka said.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

Question 1: \\"Will a Trump Presidency damage the environment so much that we can never recover?\\" This question seems to ask whether actions taken during the time when Donald Trump was president could hurt the environment in such a way that we can't fix it anymore. Kind of like when you break your favorite toy and it's broken so badly that it can't be put back together.

Well, they're similar because they both inquire about the impact of Donald Trump's presidency on the environment. But they are not exactly the same. The first one is asking about whether the damage done would be irreversible; so, like we said, if a toy is broken so badly it can't be fixed.  The second question is asking if the environment will be able to 'survive' or 'get through' Trump's presidency, which suggests there might be damage, but maybe not as destructive or permanent.

When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star.

There was a boy, who, as it turned out, was an orphan and was living and working for a small farming family. He didn't appear at first glance to ever be fully engaged  in the school learning process;he would sit quietly, never seem to get any attention from the teacher, and would spend a lot of time staring out of the window just behind him. Over the next few weeks, I got to know this boy while playing outside in the schoolyard playing baseball, or soccer. He was very athletic and very good at anything we played. I started to wonder why he didn't seem to do well in school and why the teacher ignored him. He told me he had been in several foster   homes since he was a little boy and that most of his time in the last few years had always been on farms. He said he was made to work before he went to school and as soon as he got home until it was time for bed. He was never given a chance to go out and play, nor was he allowed to have any friends although he told me he really didn't have any friends anyway, because he was an orphan and they did not want anything to do with him. I had never before been acquainted with prejudice of any kind. Here was one characteristic of a human being who through no fault of his own carried a label that prevented him from even having friends as a child. His potential was also being ignored by the teacher. It wasn't that he couldn't learn, or didn't want to -- it was because he wasn't encouraged or in some cases, allowed to. We may all meet people through the years that we tend to apply labels   to without really taking the time to get to know them, to discover their real potential because our vision is clouded by how we always put people into _ that we are used to or comfortable with.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Why might people go to a party? Possible A: to be alone, believe in god, enjoy themselves, face each other, group together  Why is \\"enjoy themselves\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Enjoy themselves\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense stems from understanding the innate social nature of humans and the primary purpose of parties as social gatherings. In most cultures, attending a party, engaging in conversations, and partaking in the various activities provided are opportunities for amusement, relaxation, and bonding with others.  To comprehend why \\"enjoy themselves\\" is the most suitable answer from the given options, let's evaluate each choice: 1. To be alone: Parties are primarily about coming together with others and participating in group activities, so seeking solitude contradicts the main purpose of attending such an event. Though someone might seek a moment of quiet or privacy at times, it is not the primary reason for attending a party. 2. Believe in god: While spirituality and religion hold significant value for many people, parties are generally unrelated to one's faith, with the main focus being social interaction and enjoyment. Religious gatherings and parties may occasionally intersect, but the primary purpose of a party typically does not revolve around deepening one's faith. 3. Enjoy themselves: This answer aligns with the primary purpose of a party, which is to engage in social activities, have fun, and create pleasant memories with friends, family, or colleagues. People attend parties to unwind, experience a variety of emotions, and indulge in the pleasure that comes from such events, making this the most common-sense explanation for attending a party. 4. Face each other: Though facing each other may be a natural part of conversation and interactions during a party, it is not the main reason for attending one. While facing others may be part of the social aspect of the party, it is a rather specific and narrow understanding of the human interactions that take place at such events, and as such, is not a primary reason for attending a party. 5. Group together: Although grouping together may occur during a party, it is merely a reflection of social dynamics and not necessarily the ultimate reason someone would attend a party. People attend parties mainly to socialize, network, and have a good time – not solely to group together. In summary, among the given options, \\"enjoy themselves\\" reflects the primary motivation for attending a party, as it comprehensively acknowledges the fundamental social nature of such events and the personal pleasure and satisfaction derived from them. By understanding the core purpose and essence of parties, it becomes clear why enjoying themselves is the answer that aligns with human common sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The task asks you to list all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element. In this case, that would be elements 14 to 16. Remember that Python list indices start from 0. So, to find the ith element, locate the element at index i-1. Similarly, to find the jth element, look for the element at index j-1. 3. Extract the elements from i-1 to j-1. In this example, that would be elements at indices 13, 14, and 15. You will get ['3067', 'w', 'm']. 4. Now, you need to reverse the order of the extracted elements.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977.  - The ZX81 is a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market  the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in several countries.  - Don Priestley (born 1940) is a video game programmer who wrote for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum between 1982 and 1989.  - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory.  - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations.  - A game programmer is a software engineer, programmer, or computer scientist who primarily develops codebases for video games or related software, such as game development tools. Game programming has many specialized disciplines, all of which fall under the umbrella term of \\"game programmer\\". A game programmer should not be confused with a game designer, who works on game design.  - The Trap Door is a computer game published for several 8 - bit formats in 1986 by Piranha Games .

An aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel, but all are in the same flower: the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit, as seen in the raspberry. Multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers. An example is the pineapple, where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit.

Sue and Peter were at an airport waiting for their flight, which had been delayed by the snowstorm. Veronica and Joe were at the destination and planning to pick Sue and Peter up from the airport when they arrived. The conversation began with Joe asking when Sue and Peter were planning to come. Sue informed everyone that their flight had been delayed due to the snowstorm and she was unsure when they would actually take off. Veronica reassured Sue not to worry, only to learn from Sue that Peter was feeling quite anxious about the situation. Peter chimed in, stating that they had already been stuck at the airport for three hours due to the flight delay. Veronica offered to pick Sue and Peter up from the airport once they arrived, asking them to keep everyone updated on their flight status. Sue then reported that it seemed like boarding was starting, and Joe expressed his hope that everything would go smoothly. However, Peter soon revealed that it was a false alarm, as they had boarded the plane but were still waiting for the aircraft to be defrosted before taking off. Sue estimated that it should take less than an hour for the defrosting process to be completed. Joe asked them to keep everyone informed, as it would take an hour for them (Joe and Victoria) to reach the airport for pickup. Peter confirmed that the defrosting process seemed to be finished, and Sue expressed her excitement to see everyone soon. Victoria sent a final message, indicating that they would be waiting for Sue and Peter in the arrivals area at the airport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \\"American aggression in the guise of the UN\\".\\"  Answer: A:","output":"To answer the question: \\"Which of the following is not the name of an army: KPA, PLA or PRC?\\", we can go step-by-step in analyzing the context provided: 1. Identify the armies in the context: The passage describes the historical events surrounding the KPA, PLA, and PRC.    a. KPA is mentioned as invading, signaling that it is an army.    b. PLA is mentioned as having an invasion force and being reorganized into another force, which points to it being an army as well. 2. Identify the non-army entity in the context: Only PRC remains.    a. The passage talks about PRC as the People's Republic of China, which is not an army but a country.

Additionally, the staff member did not listen to the reviewer's preferences and seemed to prioritize their own interests, further highlighting the poor customer service. Furthermore, the reviewer explicitly states their unhappiness with the hair-cut results, as the outcome was not what they had initially requested. Despite their dissatisfaction, they mention having paid for the service and even tipping, which demonstrates their graciousness but also emphasizes the gravity of the negative situation. In the final part of the review, the reviewer reiterates their discontent with both the establishment and customer service by labeling it as \\"awful.\\" Moreover, they declare that they will never return to the place, suggesting that the experience had a significant impact on their perception of the business.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. make music  B. orchestra  C. high school band  D. symphony  E. cricket stadium A:","output":"The most suitable option to hear a bassoon played in a very pleasing fashion would be B. orchestra.  An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble that typically includes the brass, string, woodwind, and percussion sections. Among the woodwind instruments, you will find the bassoon, which has its unique, deep, and warm sound. In an orchestra setting, the bassoon often plays both expressive melodies and supporting harmonic roles. Professional orchestras consist of highly-skilled musicians who have spent years honing their craft, allowing them to deliver high-quality performances with a focus on aesthetic and artistic value.  While other options like C. high school band and D. symphony also involve the presence of bassoons and may offer enjoyable performances, they might not always showcase the instrument to its full potential or in as pleasing a manner as an orchestra can. High school bands can have varying skill levels, and the quality of performance may not be consistently high. Meanwhile, a symphony could be a great option too, as it is a specific type of orchestra that performs classical music. However, orchestras generally encompass symphony orchestras as well as other ensembles, making option B a more inclusive choice.  Option A. make music is not a suitable or clear choice as it is not linked to any specific performance context or musical ensemble. Lastly, option E. cricket stadium is an unsuitable option as well, as the primary focus at a cricket stadium is sports, and music is not the main form of entertainment.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sir Ian Terence Botham, OBE (born 24 November 1955) is an English former cricketer and current cricket commentator. Widely regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders in cricket history, Botham represented England in both Test and One-Day International cricket. He played most of his first-class cricket for Somerset, and also for Worcestershire, Durham and Queensland. He was an aggressive right-handed batsman and, as a right arm fast-medium bowler, was noted for his swing bowling. Botham's third overseas tour was to India in February 1980. It was the fiftieth anniversary of India's entry into Test cricket and so England played a single commemorative Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Bombay. It turned into a personal triumph for Botham who became the first player in Test history to score a century and take ten wickets in the same match. England's wicketkeeper Bob Taylor held ten catches in the match, eight of them off Botham's bowling.  India won the toss and decided to bat first but, with Botham taking six for 58, they were all out on day one for 242. England replied with 296, the highlight being Botham's 114 from just 144 balls; he began his innings with England in trouble at 57 for four. This quickly became 58 for five and Botham was joined by England's other match hero Taylor. England's first five batsmen had contributed just 51 to the total. Botham was often unfairly labelled a \\"big hitter\\" but in fact his style was very orthodox (i.e., he \\"played straight\\") and in this innings he scored 17 fours but, significantly, no sixes. Taylor provided dogged support and their sixth wicket partnership realised 171 runs. When Botham was out near the end of day two, the score was 229 for six and England reached 232 for six at close of play, still ten runs behind. On the third morning, Taylor led England past India's total and, with useful batting performances by the specialist bowlers, England totalled 296 to gain a first innings lead of 54.  India's second innings was a disaster and they lost eight wickets by the close of play on the third day with only Kapil Dev offering any resistance. They were all out early on the fourth day for 149. Botham was the outstanding performer again, taking seven for 48 which gave him match figures of thirteen for 106. Geoffrey Boycott and Graham Gooch scored the necessary runs for England to win by ten wickets with a day to spare. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he have any other notable achievements?","output":"Sir Ian Terence Botham indeed has numerous notable achievements in his illustrious cricketing career. In addition to the India tour feat mentioned previously, Botham's remarkable performances include his 1981 Ashes series heroics which are fondly remembered as \\"Botham's Ashes.\\" During this series, he single-handedly turned around games with his magnificent batting and bowling, leading England to a dramatic 3-1 series victory over their arch-rivals Australia. Another achievement worth mentioning is Botham's milestone of scoring over 5,000 runs and taking more than 300 wickets in Test cricket. Only a handful of players have managed to achieve this exceptional all-round record. In total, Botham took 383 Test wickets at an average of 28.40 and scored 5,200 runs at an average of 33.54 in his 102-match Test career. In one-day internationals (ODIs), he took 145 wickets and scored 2,113 runs from 116 appearances. Apart from his incredible cricketing accomplishments, Botham is also known for his charitable work, particularly his fundraising efforts for leukemia research. He has embarked on several long-distance charity walks, raising millions of pounds for various charitable causes. Sir Ian Botham was duly recognized for his services to cricket and charity when he was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1992 and was later knighted in 2007. Today, he continues to be involved in cricket as a commentator and analyst, further contributing to the sport that he has passionately served throughout his career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Like many other inventors before him, professor Slawomir Suwak designed only the things he needed himself. He had several patents on his conscience already: an automatic cork opener for wine in the indicative state, a portable set of board games for solving personality problems, a wallet with a mini-device for the duplications of 100 zloty bills, and a piece of equipment \\"the day after\\" used to irretrievably eliminate from the time-space continuum days burdened with a hangover. Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour. It was to be worn on the right wrist. The fact it had to be the right wrist was very important. Otherwise, the invention didn't work properly, or even worse, it produced results opposite to its intended effect. Each day, its mini-containers had to be re-filled with substances promoting positive processes in the body leading to the return of good mood. There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase. The device, when it was turned on, made a low murmur (or according to some - a loud growl) designed to keep the owner in a good mood. Professor Suwak called his new baby \\"mini-anti-aggressor.\\" The McPhilips corporation expressed its interest in the product early on, even when it was still at the drawing-board stage.

Background: Adolf Hitler (German: ['adolf 'hItla] ( listen); 20 April 1889 - 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria--then part of Austria-Hungary--and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. Context: In 1923 Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the \\"Beer Hall Putsch\\". The NSDAP used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini's \\"March on Rome\\" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (state commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria's de facto ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.  On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the Burgerbraukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff. Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.  Hitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide. He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason. His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924, and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the NSDAP. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.  While at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Some passages imply genocide. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.  Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported back to Austria. The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void. In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925. Question: Did he serve his entire sentence? Answer:","output":"No, Adolf Hitler did not serve his entire sentence. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison on 1st April 1924 for high treason. However, due to the friendly treatment from the guards, and political pressure, he was pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court. He was released from jail on 20th December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. In total, including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison, rather than the full five-year sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Just 1:18 into the game Randall Cobb managed to make a punt-return TD over 80 yards to give the Packers the lead. The Vikings managed just 1 first down before the Packers defense forced them into another punt, Aaron Rodgers & co. took advantage of it and the lead went up to 14. 1:18 before the end of the first quarter the Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell missed a 52-yd field goal.

No more scoring happened in this half, Tramon Williams successfully intercepted a pass by Ponder, making it only the second highlight that quarter. The Vikings were shut down by the Packers defense by managing not to score the whole first half. At the start of the third quarter Rodgers found Jordy Nelson for a 17-yd TD pass to push the lead to 24-0. Later on, Adrian Peterson scored a TD after a 3-yd run to give Minnesota the only points in the game. The rest of the way was a one-sided affair, with the Packers scoring another three touchdowns. John Kuhn and Nelson for the second time gave Rodgers two more TD passes in this game.

A new creative team emerged in 1950 when brilliant actor James Stewart teamed with the equally-brilliant director Anthony Mann to make a series of westerns that helped define that genre for the future. Until that time Stewart was mainly noted for an aw..aw..aw approach to family oriented comedies, dramas, and romances. Not that he wasn't already a multi-talented Hollywood star. One of his best screen performances ever and one of the best for anyone on celluloid was as Macaulay 'Mike' Connor, a sarcastic writer for a scandal rag in \\"The Philadelphia Story.\\" He had even done westerns before. His portrayal of gun shy yet expert shot Thomas Jefferson Destry Jr. in the comedy western \\"Destry Rides Again\\" helped make that film a classic. But to most movie goers he was the all-American boyscout type Mr. Smith or George Bailey. Seldom was there a dark side to any of the characters he played.  Anthony Mann was associated with B flicks in the film noir mode. \\"Raw Deal,\\" \\"Side Street,\\" and \\"T-Men\\" caught the eye of James Stewart. So the two gifted men combined their resources to produce some of the greatest Hollywood westerns ever made. \\"Winchester '73\\" and \\"The Man from Laramie\\" were the best but the others were almost as effective. Mann became a successful director of A films as a result going on to direct what some critics believe to be the greatest western of them all Gary Cooper's \\"Man of the West.\\" Stewart became fabulously wealthy as a result of the partnership because he signed for part of the royalties in return for a fraction of the salary he was usually paid, a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on. Winchester '73 was also one of the first films, maybe the first, to tell a story from the standpoint of a traveling gun. Each owner is part of the tale being told and it all comes together in the exciting showdown at the end of the movie, which also holds a surprise for the viewer. Based on a story by Stuart Lake, the tale centers on revenge and the ownership of the Winchester '73. The year is 1876. Custer and his 7th cavalry have been annihilated by the Sioux and Cheyenne at Little Big Horn. The whites want revenge. The native Americans want their land and their way of life back. This conflict leads to a confrontation between native Americas led by Young Bull (young Rock Hudson showing his potential as an actor) and a small cavalry group pinned down in a canyon and joined by civilians Lin McAdam (Stewart), his partner and life-long pal High Spade ( the underrated actor Millard Mitchell), and a couple trying to find themselves, Steve Miller (Charles Drake) and Lola Manners (Shelley Winters), a soiled dove with a kind heart. Among the horse soldiers are newcomers Tony Curtis and James Best (late of the \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\"), whose part is cut short by a bullet. Wyatt Earp was in Dodge City in 1876. The movie has him as head marshal. The fine actor Will Geer (later of the Waltons) looks like an older Earp. In reality Wyatt was assistant Marshal in Dodge at the time just cutting his teeth on being a lawman. Lin McAdam wins the Winchester in a shooting contest, but has it taken from him not long afterward by outlaw Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) and his henchmen. McAdam and High Spade are after both Dutch Henry and the Winchester for the remainder of the movie. An even more sinister character emerges along the way, Waco Johnnie Dean, played as evil personified by Dan Duryea who threatens to steal the show from the other members of a stellar cast. The Winchester passes through several hands during the course of the film, each time the transfer is intense. One involves a gunrunner played to perfection by John McIntire. Other swaps are intermingled with the scenario above. All this plus the action keeps the viewer glued to the seat throughout the entire show.

Here is a goal: how to boost mood instantly How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of boosting your mood instantly, it is essential to focus on practical and effective strategies that are easy to implement. The primary goal is to shift your mental and emotional state quickly, transforming your mindset from negative or flat to positive and energized. Here are several strategies to help you achieve this goal: 1. Deep breathing exercises: Taking slow, deep breaths for a few minutes can help in calming your nerves, relaxing your mind, and promoting a feeling of happiness. Inhale deeply for a count of four seconds, hold your breath for four seconds, and then exhale for another four seconds. Repeat this process for two to three minutes to feel an immediate improvement in your mood. 2. Positive affirmations: Affirmations are powerful statements that help to reframe negative thoughts and beliefs. Choose a positive affirmation that resonates with you, such as \\"I am strong and capable,\\" or \\"I am deserving of happiness and success.\\" By repeating your affirmation aloud or internally, you can create an instant shift in your mindset. 3. Gratitude exercise: Make a list of three things that you are grateful for in your life. This simple activity can help bring your focus away from negative thoughts and elevate your mood by reminding you of the positive aspects of your life. 4. Listen to uplifting music: Music has a profound influence on our emotions. Choose a song or playlist that has a positive and uplifting vibe, and allow the music to shift your mood as you listen attentively. Singing or dancing along can also help boost your spirits further. 5. Social interaction: Reach out to a friend or family member who you know uplifts you. Sometimes just having a light conversation with someone you feel comfortable with can instantly boost your mood. 6. Aromatherapy: Smelling essential oils like lavender, citrus, or peppermint can evoke positive emotions through their pleasant aroma. Keep your preferred essential oil handy and use it when you feel the need for an instant mood boost. 7. Engage in physical activity: Exercise releases endorphins in the brain, which can help elevate your mood instantly. Even a short, brisk walk or a few minutes of stretching can have a significant impact on your emotional state. 8. Smile: Smiling tricks your brain into thinking that you are genuinely happy, as it activates the release of feel-good neurotransmitters, like serotonin, endorphins, and dopamine. Force yourself to smile and see how it can affect your emotions. 9. Visualization: Close your eyes and imagine a peaceful and tranquil place that brings you joy. Place yourself in this calming environment and focus on the positive emotions it evokes. This mental escape can help reset your mood and set a positive tone for the rest of your day. 10. Practice self-compassion: Remind yourself that it's okay to feel down or stressed occasionally and that everyone experiences these emotions. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would treat a loved one in a similar situation. By incorporating these strategies into your daily routine, you can effectively boost your mood instantly and create a more positive and resilient mindset.

Math Problem Solve 0 = -18*j + 112 + 14 for j.","output":"Okay, let's solve this math problem together like we're trying to find out how many cookies we have or something that makes it easier to understand. So, we have this equation: 0 = -18 * j + 112 + 14 First, let's add the two non-j numbers (112 and 14) together. When you have 112 cookies and someone gives you 14 more cookies, you will have: 112 + 14 = 126 cookies Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = -18 * j + 126 We want to find out how many times we need to give away 18 cookies to end up with none left. To do this, we need to move the 126 to the other side of the equal sign. Since it's positive on the right side, it will become negative on the left side: -126 = -18 * j Now, we want to know how many times we must give away 18 cookies. To find that out, we need to divide -126 by -18: j = -126 / -18 When you divide a negative number by another negative number, you get a positive result: j = 7 So, the answer is j = 7, which means we need to give away 18 cookies 7 times to be left with no cookies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

Context: The parking lot for the Center for Addictions Treatment was in the back of the building, as was the front door. The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating. The telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette. \\"Admit it now, Ray.\\" She sounded petulant. \\"Fine, I admit it.

It remains unclear if Mr Trump’s wall would supplement the existing barriers in urban areas along the 1,900 mile border, constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers in the mid-1990s, or simply replace it.

USA: Donald Trump will build the BIGGEST anti-Mexico wall... apparently      “The border business was down, but then came Isis and the Syrian conflict,” he said. “The world is changing and borders are coming back big-time.”      Another sector apparently benefitting from Mr Trump’s election win is the private prison industry. Two companies, Corrections Corp and GEO Group, saw significant gains, recouping losses they suffered after the Department of Justice announced it would discontinue the use of federal private prisons.      It is likely that a President Trump would reverse that decision.      “Private prisons would likely be a clear winner under Trump,” analysts for Height Securities LLC wrote, “as his administration will likely rescind the DOJ’s contract phase-out and [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] capacity to house detainees will come under stress.” ||||| Guns stocks are tumbling and prison stocks are soaring after Donald Trump won the presidential election.

Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation US:SWHC shares closed down 15%.      Gun sales ticked up after of President Obama’s elections on concerns that laws around gun control would become more restrictive, said Chris Krueger, senior research analyst at Lake Street Capital. Now he believes gun buyers are more confident that Trump will protect gun-carry laws, so they’re not rushing out to buy them, leading to a drop in the stock, he said.      In California, voters passed a ballot measure that tightened gun-control laws in the state. Washington state residents voted to restrict access to firearms for people that have been deemed by a court to be a threat. Nevada residents voted to expand background checks for gun purchases.      Krueger said these initiatives were somewhat expected, which is why the stocks don’t seem to be reacting much to them. Additionally, he said gun enthusiasts are bullied by the prospect of a pro-gun nominee appointed to the Supreme Court by Trump.      “I think today it’s more about the presidential election than the gun-control initiatives,” Krueger said. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"An Israeli company that constructs walls, like the one around Gaza, has experienced a surge in share prices following the election of Donald Trump because of his promise to build a wall between the US and Mexico.

Available choices:  --For example, standard accounting settings are 245 to 232 x 200 people. If you are inviting a \\" mid profile size \\" group, you will need a larger hall to accommodate the group and a larger section to hold food, beverages, cocktails, and wine.  --Gather the utensils you will need. Remember to use the 5 basic utensils of a dinner knife, salad fork, dinner fork, and a teaspoon.  --Find out if there is a pre-or post-event setup option available so that you can set up your tables. Typically, pre-event setup has 30 tables available ,.  --Take stock of how much more space you will have available to accommodate your tables and utensils. If you have a huge house, estimate a cultural event like a hollywood arts convention. Answer:","output":"Gather the utensils you will need. Remember to use the 5 basic utensils of a dinner knife, salad fork, dinner fork, and a teaspoon. These utensils are essential in providing a proper and functional place setting for your guests. Each utensil has a specific purpose, and arranging them correctly will not only make your table setting look more polished but also promote ease during the dining experience. Make sure you have enough sets of these utensils for all expected attendees. Before setting the table, ensure that each piece of silverware is clean and polished. This will create a positive first impression on your guests and demonstrate your attention to detail. Next, start with arranging the dinner plate at the center of each place setting. This will create a focal point for the rest of the silverware to be organized around. When placing the silverware, consider the order in which the courses will be served. It is customary to arrange the utensils in the order guests will use them, working from the outside in. For instance, if you start with a salad course, the salad fork should be placed on the outermost part of the settings. The dinner fork, which is used for the main course, should be placed to the left of the dinner plate. To the right of the plate, place the dinner knife, with its serrated edge facing the plate. If you are serving soup as part of the meal, add a soup spoon to the right of the dinner knife. For dessert, the dessert utensil can be placed above the dinner plate, parallel to the edge of the table with the handle pointing towards the right. If you plan to serve coffee or tea, prepare teaspoons and set them next to the dessert utensil or provide them at the time of serving the beverage. Finally, keep in mind the various types of silverware available, such as stainless steel or silver-plated, which may impact the overall aesthetic of your table settings. Choose the style that best complements the theme of your event and the existing tableware, such as plates, glasses, linens, and additional décor. This will ensure a cohesive and visually appealing presentation that will impress your guests and make your event memorable."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is difference between try and do?","output":"While these two questions are seeking clarification on differences between terms, their subject matters are different. The first question focuses on differentiating between brownfield and greenfield projects, which are concepts related to development and construction. The second question aims to differentiate between \\"try\\" and \\"do,\\" which are verbs denoting action. Let's analyze and provide detailed answers to each question separately. 1. What is the difference between a brownfield project and greenfield projects? Brownfield and greenfield projects are distinct types of development projects, particularly in the context of real estate, construction, and infrastructure. Brownfield Projects: Brownfield projects refer to the redevelopment or modification of existing structures, sites, or facilities. These projects often involve revitalizing areas that have been previously developed, such as old buildings, abandoned factories, or contaminated sites. They aim to boost the efficiency and functionalities of the existing infrastructure or create new utility out of it. Brownfield projects can also pose certain challenges requiring additional considerations: - Environmental issues: Brownfield projects may necessitate extensive environmental clean-up, especially if the previous use left contamination behind. - Legal complexities: Various permits and regulatory approvals might be needed due to the prior use of the site. - Higher costs: Remediation and handling of pre-existing structures can lead to increased expenses. Greenfield Projects: Greenfield projects, on the other hand, involve new developments on previously unused or undeveloped lands, like an empty plot or an agricultural field. These projects start from scratch, providing complete freedom for designing and planning the new structure or facility according to specific requirements. Some advantages of greenfield projects include: - More creativity: Fewer constraints from previous developments allow architects and engineers to build according to modern design principles and optimize space usage. - Lower initial costs: Since there are no pre-existing structures to remove or remediate, the initial costs can be significantly lower compared to brownfield projects. - Minimal regulatory hurdles: Greenfield projects generally face fewer legal complexities and regulatory burdens. However, greenfield projects may also contribute to urban sprawl, loss of natural habitats, and depletion of agricultural lands. 2. What is the difference between \\"try\\" and \\"do\\"? \\"Try\\" and \\"do\\" are both verbs that describe action, though they convey different meanings and intentions: Try: \\"Try\\" refers to making an effort or attempt to perform a particular task or accomplish something without any guarantee of success. It implies that an individual is uncertain of the outcome or is faced with difficulties in carrying out the task. Some examples include: - \\"I will try to finish the report by tomorrow.\\" - \\"She tried to learn a new language.\\" In these examples, the verb \\"try\\" signals a willingness to put forth effort, but it does not ensure that the goal will be achieved. Do: Contrastingly, \\"do\\" refers to the act of performing, executing, or completing a task or action. It implies more certainty and determination in completing the action, without focusing on the possibility of difficulties or failures. Some examples include: - \\"I will do my homework after dinner.\\" - \\"She did her best in the competition.\\" In these examples, the verb \\"do\\" conveys a confident commitment to carrying out the task or giving one's best effort. In conclusion, while both questions focus on differentiating between related concepts, the first question discusses the difference between brownfield and greenfield projects in development, and the second question highlights the difference between \\"try\\" and \\"do\\" as verbs denoting action."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A boy wearing a red shirt plays a video games.\\" if \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt.\\"?","output":"No, it is not logically possible to conclude that \\"A boy wearing a red shirt plays a video games\\" from the statement \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt.\\"  Understanding why requires looking into what conclusions can logically be drawn from any given statement. In logic, conclusion can only be derived if it is directly or indirectly implied in the premises or the initial statements. The premises or initial statements are conditions that justify the argument and eventually lead to the conclusion. In the statement \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt,\\" only the color of the shirt the boy is wearing is mentioned. This statement speaks nothing about what the boy is doing, i.e., whether he is playing video games or not, which is out of the context of the statement. And this statement also does not speak about him wearing a red shirt, the color of shirt mentioned is brown, not red.  For the first statement to logically lead to the conclusion \\"A boy wearing a red shirt plays a video games,”, there should be several more premises added to bridge the gap.

However, as it stands, simply from the statement \\"A boy is wearing a brown shirt,\\" it is not possible to logically conclude that \\"A boy wearing a red shirt plays video games.\\" They are unrelated in color of shirt and action the boy is doing.

He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better.

The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus. A:","output":"In the given article, it is mentioned that the inaugural games held to celebrate the completion of the Colosseum (Flavian Amphitheatre) during Emperor Titus' reign lasted for more than one hundred days.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In modern society there is a great deal of argument about competition. Some value it highly, believing that it is responsible  for social progress. Others say that competition is bad; that it sets one person against another; that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people. I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth depended on how well they performed at tennis and other skills. For them, playing well and winning are often life-and-death affairs . The development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten. However, while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed, others take an opposite attitude. In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the common players, they are strongly against competition. Most of them are young people who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society. Teaching these youngsters, I often observe  in them a desire to fail. They seem to find failure by not trying to win or achieve success. By not trying, they always have an excuse: \\" I may have lost, but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try.\\" What is not usually accepted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost, that would mean a lot. Such a loss would be a measure  of their worth. Clearly, this belief is the same as that of true competitors who try to prove themselves. Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-worth depends on how well one performs in the competition. Both are afraid of not being valued. We can discover a new meaning in competition only as this kind of fear begins to disappear. Question: What is the similar belief of the true competitors and those with a desire to fail? Options: A: One's worth lies in his performance in the competition. B: One's success in competition needs great efforts. C: One's achievement is decided by his special skills. D: One's success is based on how hard he has tried.

During the week leading up to the game, Bengals star wide receiver Chad Ochocinco said in an interview that he'll do a celebratory \\"Lambeau Leap\\" into the end zone seats if he scores in Sunday's game at Lambeau Field. The Packers started the contest with the ball, but could only manage to move the ball to mid field before they settled for a punt. The Bengals offense then took to the field at their own 37-yard line and after moving the ball into the Packers red zone, Carson Palmer managed to hit Laveranues Coles on a short 5-yard pass in the center of the end zone to take an early 7-0 lead. The Packers managed to match the Bengals drive though, by capping an 11-play, 80-yard drive with a 3-yard pass by Aaron Rodgers to Donald Driver along the right sideline of the end zone. The score was now tied a 7-7. The Bengals regained possession after the Packers touchdown, but on the first play of their corresponding drive Carson Palmer attempted a pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco along the right sideline, but Packers cornerback Charles Woodson stepped in front of Ochocinco and intercepted the attempted pass. Woodson then returned the ball down to the Bengals 11-yard line for a return of 22 yards. Two plays later, Packers running back Ryan Grant scored a touchdown on a 4-yard run outside of the left guard to take a 14-7 lead. After the Grant touchdown, both teams exchanged possessions into the second quarter. On the Bengals second drive after the Ryan Grant touchdown run, quarterback Carson Palmer capped the Bengals drive with a 1-yard sneak up the middle for a touchdown to re-tie the contest at 14-14. The Packers offense again sputtered and couldn't find the rhythm that the offense once possessed a season ago. After the punt, Carson Palmer was sacked for a loss of 8 yards and then on the next play Charles Woodson intercepted another pass along the right sideline from Palmer and returned the ball 37 yards for the Packers first defensive score of the season to retake the lead 21-14. On the Bengals next drive though, they would then retake the lead again on a 5-yard Palmer pass to Chris Henry in the back of the end zone. The score was now tied 21-21. The Packers offense retook the field aiming to break the tie before halftime, but only could manage to give kicker Mason Crosby a 55-yard attempt in which he missed as the clock expired. The teams went into the half tied at 21. After the half, the Bengals offense took to the field first but was forced to punt. The Packers responded by moving the ball quite efficiently, but their drive came to an end when Ryan Grant fumbled after pulling in a short Aaron Rodgers pass. The Bengals then managed to capitalize on the Packers first turn over of the season by putting together a 12-play, 62-yard drive capped by another Carson Palmer touchdown pass, this time to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. After the touchdown, Ochocinco ran behind the endzone looking for a place to Lambeau Leap finally settling for a group of Bengals fans in the right corner of the endzone. Both teams exchanged possession without scoring through the end of the third quarter. With both teams unable to score into the fourth quarter, the Bengals finally converted a field goal with 2 minutes left in game. to take a 31-21 lead. After the field goal, the Packers took over and managed to get the ball into field goal range in which Packers coach decided to kick the field goal to decrease the lead to 7 needing an onside kick recovery to tie the game anyway. The Mason Crosby kick was successful and the Packers special teams unit then lined up in the onside kick formation. Mason Crosby kicked the ball the right side and the ball hopped right to Packers corner back Tramon Williams for the recovery. With 45 seconds remaining, The Packers offense took the field with no timeouts. Rodgers then completed a couple of passes and moved the ball past midfield with 16 seconds remaining. Rodgers then completed a 25-yard strike to Donald Driver in the center of the field for 25 yards down to the Bengals 10-yard line. Hurrying down field the Packers snapped the ball with 1 second remaining but the Packers were flagged for a false start. With the penalty the remaining time was run off the clock and the game ended.

We all keep hearing that trains are slow, that they lose money, and that they're dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, the railways have become highly competitive with motorcars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't leave you as a plane does, miles and miles from the city center. It doesn't hold you up as a car does, in endless traffic jams.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award?, using the article: In June 1965, Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971 the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be. The minor planet 4149 Harrison, discovered in 1984, was named after him, as was a variety of Dahlia flower. In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrison's \\"critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of world music\\" and for his having \\"advanced society's comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music\\". Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\".In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Eric Clapton organised the event, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle, who described Harrison as \\"one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced\\", was among the performers of Monty Python's \\"Lumberjack Song\\". The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.In 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra.A documentary film entitled George Harrison: Living in the..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award is \\"George\\". This person is George Harrison, notable as a member of the Beatles who received recognition for their musical contributions with an appointment as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1965. Harrison continued to carve his legacy in the music industry as reflected by his various achievements over the years. His contributions went beyond the Beatles, as Harrison also pursued successful endeavours in his solo career and collaborations with other artists. These are evident in receiving an Academy Award for the Best Original Song Score in 1971 for the film Let It Be, as well as recognitions extended after his passing, such as his posthumous induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. However, the accolade in question, the Billboard Century Award, was received by Harrison in December 1992. This award honours music artists for their significant bodies of work and in Harrison's case, it recognized how integral he was to shaping the modern concept of world music and demonstrating how popular music can embody spirituality and altruism. Therefore, the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award bearing the first name \\"George\\" is George Harrison."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Он может производиться и использоваться в различных видах и составах, которые могут быть разделены на следующие основные категории: 1. Горячий асфальт (тонкозернистый и крупнозернистый) - эта разновидность асфальта производится путем смешивания битума с песком и мелким гравием или крупным щебнем. Эти компоненты нагреваются для получения горячей смеси, которая затем укладывается машинами и трамбуется для формирования плотного асфальтированного покрытия. 2. Холодный асфальт - этот вид асфальта изготавливается без нагрева компонентов до высоких температур. Здесь используются специальные добавки или модифицированные виды битума, которые позволяют смешивать и укладывать асфальтную смесь при более низких температурах. Холодный асфальт обычно применяется для быстрого ремонта повреждений дорожного покрытия, таких как ямы и трещины. 3. Черный щебень - это основной компонент многих асфальтовых смесей, который обеспечивает прочность и структуру дорожного покрытия.

Given the question: If people are shot in the head by a bullet, what is the likely result? - believe in god - migraine - complete high school - die suddenly - cross river  The best answer is The answer is:","output":"die suddenly. A gunshot to the head often results in immediate death due to the critical damage inflicted on the brain, which is the control center of the body. The brain is responsible for all bodily functions including heartbeat, breathing, consciousness, and movement. Severe damage to the brain can result in immediate cessation of these life-sustaining functions. In non-fatal cases, it can cause permanent brain damage leading to cognitive and physical disabilities. Other outcomes like migraines or progression in life events like completing high school or crossing a river are not directly related to being shot in the head, and believing in God is a personal and complex deliberation that can't be determined by a physical event like a gunshot.

When done correctly, dog training not only cultivates a strong bond between owners and their pets, but it also ensures a well-behaved and disciplined companion. In this article, we will discuss four key principles of dog training: being patient, rewarding good behavior, keeping training sessions short, and starting training as soon as possible. 1. Be Patient: Training a dog is a gradual process that requires understanding, compassion, and tolerance. Dogs, like humans, learn at different paces and may need more or less time to grasp a concept or a command. Patience is essential because it helps to create a positive and stress-free learning environment, where the dog feels safe and encouraged to grow and learn new skills. Frustration, anger, or impatience might hinder the training process and can even create negative associations for the dog. Be patient and recognize that progress may be slow, but each step forward is a significant achievement. 2. Reward Good Behavior: Dogs respond well to positive reinforcement; the use of praise, treats, or warm affection can motivate them to perform a specific action. Rewarding good behavior is crucial because it helps the dog associate the action with a positive outcome. The more frequently the dog is rewarded for good behavior, the more likely it is to become a habit. This encourages the development of desirable behaviors while concurrently discouraging undesired actions. Be consistent in rewarding your dog and choose rewards that hold a high value for your pet, such as a favorite treat or toy. 3. Keep Training Sessions Short: Dogs have limited attention spans, and it is important to keep training sessions short and exciting to maintain their focus and interest. Experts recommend that training sessions should not exceed 15 minutes, especially for younger dogs, since their concentration may diminish over extended periods. Conducting multiple short sessions throughout the day is more beneficial than longer, less frequent sessions. This allows the dog to absorb and practice the new skills without becoming overwhelmed or fatigued. 4. Start Training Immediately: The sooner you begin training your dog, the easier and more effective the process will be. Puppies are more receptive to learning new commands and concepts, whereas older dogs may have developed habits that are more difficult to modify. This does not mean that older dogs are untrainable; it simply means that the process may take more time and effort. In either case, starting your dog's training as soon as you bring them home is vital for fostering good behavior and establishing clear expectations. Conclusion: Dog training is a rewarding and fulfilling aspect of the bond between pet and owner. Focusing on patience, rewarding good behavior, keeping training sessions short, and starting training as early as possible can significantly improve the process for both the dog and the trainer. Remember that consistency is key, and that every step forward in your dog's training journey is a testament to the loving and nurturing partnership you share."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, because I don't think that a per -- I don't think there is a per se rule that should apply here because this is a grant of Congress, to Congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial. There may be other constitutional provisions that come into play, or there may be other existing -- Can we draw the following conclusion? Congress has the power to write laws","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Congress has the power to write laws based on the given statement and further understanding of the United States Constitution. The statement mentions that it is a grant of power to Congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial. This grant of power refers to the authority given to the United States Congress in the U.S Constitution. As Congress is the legislative branch of the federal government of the United States, it is primarily responsible for making laws. To better understand this, it is essential to look at the history and structure of the U.S. Constitution. Established in 1787, the Constitution provides both a framework and guiding principles for the functioning of a democratic government in the United States. The Constitution separates the powers of the federal government into three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Article I of the U.S. Constitution describes the authority and power granted to Congress. It states that the legislative power, which is the power to create laws, shall be vested in a bicameral legislature consisting of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Together, these two houses are responsible for writing, debating, and ultimately passing bills, which, when signed by the President or passed over a presidential veto, become federal laws. The primary purpose of having a bicameral Congress is to ensure that all perspectives are considered, and the interests of the states, as well as their constituents, are represented both at a local and national level. This process also involves several checks and balances that are crucial to maintaining the stability of the federal government and preventing the abuse of power by a single entity or individual. Moreover, the United States Congress operates within a broader constitutional framework, which includes safeguards to protect citizens' fundamental rights and liberties, as well as accountability and oversight mechanisms to ensure that laws are consistent with the Constitution. While Congress is granted wide latitude to write laws, they must uphold and respect the Constitution's rights, principles, and limitations, as enforced by the executive and judicial branches. In conclusion, yes, Congress has the power to write laws based on the authority granted to them by the United States Constitution. Legislating is a fundamental function of the legislative branch and is essential for maintaining a well-functioning democratic government. However, this power must be exercised within the wider context of the U.S. Constitution to ensure that all laws adhere to the principles of democracy, fairness, and the protection of individual rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.  Now, I have a new situation: Tree city and Leaf city were the two biggest cities in Boulderland. Tree city burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, while Leaf city was very protective towards its environment.  Answer this question please: Which city caused less air pollution? Answer:","output":"Leaf city caused less air pollution. Step 1: Understanding the situation The situation presents two cities: Tree city, which burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, and Leaf city, which was very protective towards its environment.  Step 2: Comparing air pollution sources Tree city relied heavily on burning gas and fossil fuels, which are known to be significant sources of air pollution. On the other hand, Leaf city's approach to prioritize environmental protection suggests that it likely took measures to reduce air pollution and relied less on pollution-causing sources. Step 3: Drawing the conclusion Since Leaf city took protective measures for the environment, it is reasonable to conclude that it caused less air pollution compared to Tree city, which had more pollution-causing activities."},{"instruction":"Q:- number is 25    - draftpick is 36 -lrb- by the green bay packers -rrb-      - birth date is 15 september 1939    - nfl is bur593220    - debutyear is 1964    - statlabel is rushing attempts-yards receptions-yards touchdowns    - statvalue is 304-1088 112-1379 13    - death date is 28 february 2009    - college is mississippi state    - birth place is goodman , mississippi    - death place is bay st. louis , mississippi    - draftyear is 1964    - position is hb/wr/p    - draftround is 3    - afldraftyear is 1964    - finalyear is 1969    - afldraftpick is 30    - afldraftround is 4    Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 08:25 EST, 10 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 15:31 EST, 12 October 2012. Enraged: Robert Zimmerman Jr., pictured on Piers Morgan Tonight, launched a threatening Twitter tirade at the the Trayvon Martin family's attorneys. The older brother of George Zimmerman has launched a Twitter tirade on an attorney for Trayvon Martin's family, vowing to make it his life's work to disbar her. Robert Zimmerman Jr.'s rant followed a week of television interviews in which he protested the innocence of his brother, who stands accused of killing the unarmed teenager in February. The Zimmermans have been on a national media crusade over the past week - chatting with Piers Morgan and Spanish-speaking channels - to 'reintroduce' the family, who believe they have been misrepresented throughout the high-profile, divisive case. On Monday, Robert Zimmerman Jr. marked the end of his press tour by unleashing his anger at attorney Natalie Jackson, blaming her for the false portrayal of his family. 'I hope GOD grants you a long life so. you live to repent for what you have done,' he wrote on a tweet to her on Monday. He went on: 'My Life’s work = you WILL be held accountable for your words/actions. You AINT seen NOTHIN' yet... I will see U disbarred.' And, in a reference to what critics have dubbed the 'scheme team' behind the case - attorneys Jackson and Benjamin Crump and Orlando publicist Ryan Julison - he added: 'The Scheme will be exposed, one by one, day by day - SHAME on you.' Jackson quipped back: 'Please see my Rule #1: Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference - Mark Twain.' Scroll down for video. Anger: Zimmerman, the brother of George Zimmerman, directed messages at attorney Natalie Jackson. His emotional outburst underscores the trouble the family has faced controlling their image, and the struggle the defense team endures to keep their client and his family in line. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara told the Miami Herald that he. cringed when he saw the rant and that the media tour had gone ahead without George Zimmerman's knowledge. In their attempts to support their relative, the Zimmermans may be doing more harm than good, he suggested. 'I have been cautious with how we act in. this case and now someone with the same last name who does not act with. the same constraints is out there - and I have no control over him,' O'Mara said. Target: Natalie Jackson (centre) is representing the Martins with Daryl Parks (left) and Ben Crump (left) It is just another debacle for the defense team. They faced an early struggle after nationwide protests called for the arrest of Zimmerman, who they claimed attacked 17-year-old Trayvon because he was African American. After Zimmerman was released from prison after bailing himself out, he ended up back behind bars and on a new bail after the courts accused him about failing to reveal the extent of his legal funds. Then, last month, Zimmerman's best friend published a book full of errors about how Trayvon died - but ended up on the prosecution's evidence list, the Herald reported. Robert Zimmerman Jr., 31, decided to stand up for his family - who have all gone into hiding since the case arose - and travelled to Los Angeles last week to carry out interviews. Case: Neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, left, has been charged with second-degree murder for the February shooting of Trayvon Marton, right. He shot the teenager as he walked home. Family support: Robert Jr. has appeared on a number of TV and radio shows this week to speak against the portrayal of his brother and his family by the media. His aim, he said in an email to. reporters, was to 'reintroduce the Zimmerman family' and he was the only. person authorized to speak on their behalf. He went on to appear on radio and television shows in Los Angeles, where he painted his brother as a hard-working man attacked by the teenager and demonised by the media. He also appeared on Piers Morgan Tonight with his mother, who had her face obscured, before taking to his Twitter account for the attack on the Martin lawyer. In an email to the Herald, he stood by his rant, saying: 'I. don't want her to be able to use her position as an attorney to. assassinate anyone else's character or to ever hurt anyone else's. family.' Fight: Attorneys for Zimmerman said the Twitter rant will not have helped their already troubled case. Here, supporters of Trayvon Martin hold a rally in March, calling for Zimmerman's arrest. His brother, 29, has been charged with second-degree murder for the February 26 shooting in Sanford, Florida. Trayvon was found to be just carrying Skittles and iced tea when he was killed, but Zimmerman's attorneys claim he acted in self defense when the teenager tackled him. The team has requested that Trayvon's school records and social media posts be released as part of the trial. A hearing for the request will be heard on October 19. See below for video - Robert Zimmerman Jr. speaks to Piers Morgan. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article talks about a man named Robert Zimmerman Jr., who is the older brother of George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman was accused of killing an unarmed teenager named Trayvon Martin in February 2012. Robert and his family have been trying to show that they are not bad people by talking to different people on TV and the radio.  Robert got very angry and started saying mean things on Twitter to a lady named Natalie Jackson, who is a lawyer helping Trayvon Martin's family. He said he will work hard every day to make sure she gets in trouble for what she said about his family. The lawyer, Natalie Jackson, responded with a quote from Mark Twain, a famous writer, that says you should not argue with a foolish person, because other people might not be able to tell the difference between the two.  Some people think that even though Robert is trying to help his brother, his actions could be causing more problems for the brothers and their family."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: EACH of us fails from time to time. If we are wise, we accept these failures as a necessary part of the learning process. But all too often we convey to our children either by words or by actions that failure is something to be ashamed of, that nothing but top performance meets our approval. Donnie was my youngest third-grader. His fear of failure kept him from classroom games that other children played excitedly. He seldom answered questions - he might be wrong. He seldom finished his work because he repeatedly checked with me to be sure he hadn't made a mistake. I tried my best to build his self-confidence. But nothing changed until midterm, when Mary Anne, a student teacher, was assigned to our classroom. She was young and pretty, and she loved children. My pupils, Donnie included, adored her. But even enthusiastic, loving Mary was _ by this little boy who feared he might make a mistake. Then one morning we were working math problems. Donnie had copied the problems with painstaking neatness and filled in answers for the first row. Pleased with his progress, I left the children with Mary. But when I returned, Donnie was in tears. He'd missed the third problem. Mary looked at me in despair. Suddenly her face brightened. From the desk we shared, she got a canister   filled with pencils. \\"Look, Donnie,\\" she said, \\"I've got something to show you.\\" She removed the pencils and placed them on his desk. \\"See these pencils, Donnie?\\" she continued. \\"They belong to Mrs. Lindstrom and me. See how the erasers are worn? That's because we make mistakes too. Lots of them. But we erase the mistakes and try again. That's what you must learn to do, too.\\" She kissed him and continued: \\"I'll leave one of these pencils on your desk so you'll remember that everybody makes mistakes, even teachers.\\" Donnie looked up with love in his eyes and just a glimmer   of a smile.

Q: Abstract: Nervous system function requires proper development of two functional and morphological domains of neurons, axons and dendrites. Although both these domains are equally important for signal transmission, our understanding of dendrite development remains relatively poor. Here, we show that in C. elegans the Wnt ligand, LIN-44, and its Frizzled receptor, LIN-17, regulate dendrite development of the PQR oxygen sensory neuron. In lin-44 and lin-17 mutants, PQR dendrites fail to form, display stunted growth, or are misrouted. Manipulation of temporal and spatial expression of LIN-44, combined with cell-ablation experiments, indicates that this molecule is patterned during embryogenesis and acts as an attractive cue to define the site from which the dendrite emerges. Genetic interaction between lin-44 and lin-17 suggests that the LIN-44 signal is transmitted through the LIN-17 receptor, which acts cell autonomously in PQR. Furthermore, we provide evidence that LIN-17 interacts with another Wnt molecule, EGL-20, and functions in parallel to MIG-1/Frizzled in this process. Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for Wnt and Frizzled molecules in regulating dendrite development in vivo..

What is the solution?","output":"In order to solve the given equation, -240*n + 302 - 62 = 0, for n, you will need to follow a process of rearranging and simplifying the equation to isolate n. Here's the step-by-step solution: Step 1: Combine like terms Combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation. -240*n + (302 - 62) = 0 -240*n + 240 = 0 Step 2: Isolate n To isolate n, you will need to move the constant term (240) to the other side of the equation. You can do this by adding or subtracting the term from both sides of the equation. In this case, you will subtract 240 from both sides. -240*n + 240 - 240 = 0 - 240 -240*n = -240 Step 3: Solve for n Now that you have isolated n, you will need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n, which is -240 in this case.

Q:Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare.

Given these facts, what produces variation among the following options: - animals  - evolution  - pollen  - environment  - a doorbell  - movement  - seasons  - competition The answer is:","output":"To identify the correct answer, let's go through the options step by step. 1. Animals: Although animals display variation, they don't produce variation on their own. They only express the genetic differences already present. 2. Evolution: Evolution is the overall process that leads to variation and selection, but it is not the direct cause or producer of variation. 3. Pollen: Pollen plays a role in plant reproduction, leading to genetic variation by allowing the fusion of sperm and egg cells in different plants. However, it does not contribute to variation in other forms of life. 4. Environment: The environment does not produce variation directly but acts as a selection force in the process of evolution. It influences which variations are more suited for survival and reproduction. 5. A doorbell: A doorbell is unrelated to the production of variation. It's an inanimate human-made object with no impact on biological variation. 6. Movement: Movement can contribute to creating new gene combinations when organisms relocate or migrate to different areas. However, it is not the primary producer of variation, just an indirect influencer. 7. Seasons: Like environment, seasons can act as a selection force by influencing survival and reproduction rates of organisms. However, they do not directly produce variation. 8. Competition: Competition acts as a selection force, favoring traits that help organisms survive and reproduce in an environment where resources are limited, but it doesn't generate variation itself. None of the options listed is the direct producer of variation. Variation mostly originates from genetic mutations and sexual reproduction (recombination).

Yet Mexican drug cartels are arguably as dangerous and deadly as terrorists, and they were operating far inside our borders well before 9/11.

So, a long time ago, lots of people in America thought the biggest danger to our country was something called terrorism. Terrorism is when some bad people try to scare and hurt others on purpose. There was a really sad event called 9/11, where terrorists made two big buildings fall down, and many people got hurt. After that, America decided to send soldiers to a place called Afghanistan to try to stop more dangerous events like this from happening. Now, there's another problem called Mexican drug cartels. These are groups of people selling bad things called drugs and sometimes hurting people too. Some people think the drug cartels are just as dangerous as terrorists.  Since that sad event called 9/11, there haven't been many big terrorist attacks in the US.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others...

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard).

Step 2: Determine the atomic number and mass number of carbon-12. The atomic number of carbon is 6, meaning it has 6 protons. Carbon-12 has a mass number of 12 (hence its name), which is the combined number of protons and neutrons. Step 3: Calculate the number of neutrons in carbon-12. Since the mass number of carbon-12 is the sum of its protons and neutrons, we can find the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number.

By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A police officer, also known as a policewoman, policeman, police agent is a warranted law employee of a police force. In the United States, \\"officer\\" usually is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, \\"officer\\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often \\"constable\\". In some nations the use of the rank \\"officer\\" is legally reserved for military personnel. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary citizens.  - Special police (also see Auxiliary police) usually describes a police force or unit within a police force whose duties and responsibilities are significantly different from other forces in the same country or from other police in the same force, although there is no consistent international definition. A special constable, in most cases, is not a member of a special police force; in countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and often elsewhere, a special constable is a voluntary or part-time member of a national or local police force or a person involved in law enforcement who is not a police officer but has some of the powers of a police officer.  - Concurrent jurisdiction exists where two or more courts from different systems simultaneously have jurisdiction over a specific case. This situation leads to forum shopping, as parties will try to have their civil or criminal case heard in the court that they perceive will be most favorable to them.   - Community Safety Accreditation Schemes are a means by which the Chief Constable of a police force in the United Kingdom may grant a limited range of police powers to employees of non-police organisations who contribute towards community safety. Community Safety Accreditation Schemes were created under section 40 of the Police Reform Act 2002. Individuals who have been granted these powers are known under the Act as Accredited Persons.  - In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes. These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole and probation. A typical \\"correctional institution\\" is a prison. A \\"correctional system\\", also known as a \\"penal system\\", thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and community-based programs like parole and probation boards;. This system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts. Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly-named agencies.  - Michele Marie Leonhart ( born February 27 , 1956 ) is an American career law enforcement officer and the former Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . After the resignation of Administrator Karen P. Tandy in the fall of 2007 , Leonhart also served as Acting Administrator of the DEA . On February 2 , 2010 , President Barack Obama nominated Leonhart for the position of DEA Administrator . Leonhart 's tenure as DEA Administrator was marked with controversy and scandals including a prostitution scandal ; by the end of her service in April 2015 , she was labelled \`\` embattled '' when a bipartisan group of lawmakers declared that they had no confidence in her leadership . On April 21 , she conveyed to Attorney General Eric Holder that she intended to resign the following month .  - In the United States, a special agent is usually a detective or investigator for a state, county, municipal, federal, or tribal government who primarily serve in investigatory roles. Within the United States' federal law enforcement system, dozens of federal agencies employ federal law enforcement officers, each with different criteria pertaining to the use of the titles \\"\\"Special Agent\\"\\" versus \\"\\"Agent\\"\\". In intelligence usage, agent refers to one who is recruited, trained, controlled and employed to obtain and report information.  - The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is the statute establishing federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. It was passed by the 91st United States Congress as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.  - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing.  - The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States. The DEA is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security, and the U.S. Border Patrol. It has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations both domestic, and abroad.  - The role of Immigration officers is to ensure that immigration legislation is enforced. This can cover the rules of entry for visa applicants, foreign nationals or those seeking asylum at the border, detecting and apprehending those that have breached the border and removing them, or pursuing those in breach of immigration and criminal laws.  - Parole officers and probation officers play a role in the criminal justice systems by supervising offenders released from incarceration or sentenced to non-custodial sanctions such as community service. In some jurisdictions parole or probation officers are involved in presenting reports on offenders and making sentencing recommendation to courts of law.  - Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to serve as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004.  - Homeland security is an American umbrella term for \\"the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive to the national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and minimize the damage from attacks that do occur.\\"  - The Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States, which simultaneously serves as the nation's prime federal law enforcement agency. Operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI is concurrently a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. A leading U.S. counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes.  - A law enforcement officer (LEO) or peace officer, in North American English, is a public-sector employee whose duties primarily involve the enforcement of laws. The phrase can include police officers, municipal law enforcement officers, special police officers, customs officers, state troopers, special agents, special investigators, border patrol officers, immigration officers, court officers, probation officers, parole officers, arson investigators, auxiliary officers, game wardens, sheriffs, corrections, marshals, and deputies. Security guards are civilians and therefore not law enforcement officers, unless they have been granted powers to enforce particular laws, such as those accredited under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme. Although typically the term \\"law enforcement officer\\" refers to those government agents with police powers, prosecutors are also law enforcement officers.  - A sheriff is a government official, with varying duties, existing in some countries with historical ties to England, where the office originated. There is an analogous although independently developed office in Iceland that is commonly translated to English as \\"sheriff,\\" and this is discussed below.  - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - An officer is a person who has a position of authority in a hierarchical organization.  - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.

Context: In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea (£1.05 in present British currency) per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I read this background article the other day: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\"  I am facing a new situation today: Tom and Jerry are two friends who have always had competitions with one another throughout their whole lives. Yesterday, they just finished their most unique competition so far. Each man was given a room to sit in that had several highly radioactive objects in it. The challenge was to see who would stay in the chamber longer. Tom didn't stay in his room for very long, but Jerry felt determined to win and stayed in his chamber almost the entire day.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which man is more likely to go bald sooner? A:","output":"Based on the background article and the situation you presented, Jerry, who stayed in his chamber with highly radioactive objects for almost the entire day, is more likely to go bald sooner. Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause damage to living tissue and result in various health issues, including hair loss. As stated in the background article, high doses of ionizing radiation can lead to Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), which may cause symptoms such as skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and death. Jerry's prolonged exposure to the radioactive objects puts him at a higher risk of experiencing these negative effects, including hair loss or baldness, compared to Tom who stayed in his room for a shorter period. However, it's important to note that calculating the exact risk and chance of these health issues happening, such as hair loss, is not well understood and may depend on factors like the level of radiation exposure and individual susceptibility. Additionally, without knowing the exact levels of the radiation in each room, we can't provide a precise estimation of the risks they faced. Nevertheless, based on the information given, Jerry is likely to face greater risks, including going bald sooner, due to his longer exposure to the radioactive environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: -- negative -- positive Short movie review: i just did n't care  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review provided, it is apparent that the critic is thinking negatively about the movie. The statement \\"I just didn't care\\" signifies that the movie failed to capture the critic's interest or evoke any emotional response from them. When a critic has a positive view of a movie, they typically express appreciation for various aspects such as the plot, performances, direction, cinematography, or other notable elements. They would highlight the aspects that resonated with them and made a lasting impression. Positive reviews would contain words and phrases like \\"impressive,\\" \\"well-crafted,\\" \\"excellent performance,\\" and \\"compelling.\\" On the other hand, a negative review, like the one provided, often suggests a lack of impact or investment in the film. The critic is likely disappointed or underwhelmed by the movie. As a result, they might use language that reflects their dissatisfaction or indifference. Expressions like \\"didn't care,\\" \\"forgettable,\\" \\"mediocre,\\" or \\"uninspired\\" can be indicative of negative opinions about a film. In this case, the critic simply saying \\"I just didn't care\\" reveals a negative opinion since they are not highlighting any positive aspects nor showing any enthusiasm about the film. They neither felt connected to the movie nor found it significant enough to garner their interest or emotional involvement, which reflects an unfavorable assessment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins.

Mr. Speaker, Robert Kennedy once said each time a person stands up for an ideal, strikes out against injustice, they send forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of resistance. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Robert kennedy felt that unilateral action was effective .","output":"Based on the given paragraph by Robert Kennedy, it is possible to infer that he believed in the power of individual actions and their capacity to create significant change. However, it is important to consider the context and nuances of his statement to determine whether it entirely supports the notion that \\"Robert Kennedy felt that unilateral action was effective.\\" The quote itself emphasizes the value of individuals taking a stand and acting in the face of injustice. Kennedy's words illustrate the idea that although a single action may seem insufficient or negligible, collectively, they have the potential to bring about substantial change in society. In this sense, Kennedy appears to be advocating for the importance of individual action in tackling societal issues and promoting justice. However, the statement that Kennedy felt unilateral action was effective can be seen as an oversimplification of his beliefs. Unilateral action broadly refers to decisions or actions taken by a single individual, group, or nation without the agreement or cooperation of others. While Kennedy's quote does acknowledge the importance of individual actions, it does not dismiss the significance of collaboration and solidarity. The mention of ripples crossing \\"from a million different centers of energy\\" indicates that Kennedy believed change and progress were not solely the result of solitary efforts. He recognized the need for diverse individuals to come together, contributing their individual energies and efforts to a collective movement. In this way, it can be argued that Kennedy's statement speaks more to the power of the collective than to unilateralism. To conclude, while Robert Kennedy's quote does emphasize the importance and potential impact of individual actions, it also highlights the necessity of these actions coming together to build a \\"current\\" capable of sweeping down the \\"mightiest walls of resistance.\\" This passage demonstrates both the value of singular actions and the power of collective efforts. As a result, it would be more accurate to say that Robert Kennedy felt that individual actions could be effective when combined with other like-minded actions, rather than asserting that he believed unilateral action alone was effective."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Author Zoe Strimpel says Facebook bombards single women with pictures of 'perfect' weddings and babies, which causes envy and voyeurism. Single women should ditch Facebook because the 'perfect lives' of their friends are bad for their health, a relationship expert has warned. Author Zoe Strimpel says the social media site bombards singletons with pictures of 'perfect' weddings and babies which causes envy and voyeurism. She. said: 'What [Facebook] does is it enhances the sense that your life is. lacking and specifically, when you are single, you focus in on all those. pictures of perfect weddings, perfect babies, perfect couples. She urged single women to cut down or get rid of Facebook completely during a lecture at Cambridge’s Festival of Ideas. She. said getting rid of your profile will help 'limit that delicious but. yucky feeling of voyeurism, slight envy, maybe even narcissism.' Ms Strimpel, who wrote ‘Man Diet: One Woman’s Quest to End Bad Romance’, said the fairer sex also spends too much time monitoring potential suitors online. She said the ready availability of biographical information on Facebook encourages women to over-analyse potential dates. 'You become addicted to information that you might not need to know about, say, Joe the musician who you drunkenly snogged at a house warming, but who turns out has a girlfriend. 'Thanks to Facebook you may know his mother’s name, the details of his last holiday, the names of his exes, who he is hanging around with. 'This is not healthy or helpful information, plus it gives the impression that these men are more in your life than they actually are, which is quite corrosive. 'There’s plenty of psychology that supports taking a break from social media.' On a more positive note. The Joy of Sex rewriter Susan Quilliam told the same conference modern women have never had it better in bed. The psychologist, single at 63 after her marriage of 25 years ended, said women are free to enjoy sex - unlike her mother who didn’t know what her clitoris was. Ms Strimpel said the site 'enhances the sense that your life is lacking and specifically, when you are single, you focus in on all those pictures of perfect weddings, perfect babies, perfect couples' (file picture) She said: 'I can, if I so wish, go out and sleep with somebody tonight without opprobrium, without being told I’m a slut.

'It meant a lot of drinking, a lot of staying out late and feeling hungover at work, which was horrible. 'It meant telling a lot of funny stories about my capers to my friends, who loved it and they wanted more and more, and spending a lot time worrying about various guys that I don’t even remember now.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The seven biggest midterm campaign story lines with seven days left There are only seven days left until the midterm election. (Not that we're counting or anything.) So much to be sorted out, so little time. Here are the seven biggest story lines to watch with a week left to go: 1. The obvious: Will Republicans win the Senate majority? This was the biggest question on Day One of the midterm campaign. It will stay that way until the very end. The GOP needs to gain six seats to win back the chamber. If you watch just three races, make them North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa. Polls show razor-tight races in these states, which could collectively decide which party controls the Senate. Also keep an eye on Georgia, where Democrats feel like they have some momentum. It could go to a runoff. (More on that below.) 2. Runoffs? You kidding me? Runoffs? The smart money says the Louisiana Senate race is headed to a runoff. Georgia may be headed to one, too. (Runoffs are triggered in those states if no candidate wins a majority.) If control of the Senate is on the line, these two states will be the focus of the political world for the next couple of months. Louisiana's runoff would be Dec. 6. Georgia's Senate runoff would be Jan. 6 -- after the new Congress is scheduled to be sworn in. 3. How many seats will Republicans gain in the House? It's becoming increasingly clear that this election is shaping up as a painful one for House Democrats. After talking up their recruits and offensive opportunities for months, they are shifting more and more money toward protecting endangered incumbents. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden (Ore.) has been saying for months that getting to 245 is an attainable goal for Republicans, who currently hold a 233-199 advantage. That would be a big victory for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Co. President Obama's low approval rating is dragging down Democrats everywhere. But the reason gaining a dozen seats is on the high end of what observers are predicting for Republicans is that they did so well in 2010 and there simple aren't nearly as many swing districts that can realistically be flipped. 4. Will Republicans hold their 29 gubernatorial seats? Republicans have set a public goal for governor's races: Walk away with 29 wins -- exactly the number they currently hold. What's so exciting about treading water? Well, considering that the GOP is defending 22 seats compared to just 14 for Democrats, and they have nine incumbents running in states Obama won twice, it would be more of an accomplishment than meets the eye. Democrats have declined to set a public goal of their own. Both sides have added unlikely pickup opportunities to the fold, scrambling the landscape. The GOP could spring upsets in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Colorado. Democrats could pick off Kansas and Georgia. 5. Is this the beginning, or is this the end? We're looking at you, Scott Walker and Martha Coakley. Two of the most interesting subplots in the gubernatorial landscape involve household names whose political fortunes hinge on the outcome next Tuesday: their careers will take a serious hit if they lose, and be set on a superstar trajectory if they win. If Walker wins reelection in Wisconsin, he will reaffirm his spot on the short list of top potential candidates for president. If he loses, he's no longer on that list. Polls shows Walker in a close race against Democratic challenger Mary Burke. Coakley, who lost to Scott Brown disastrously in 2010, is getting a second chance in Massachusetts -- although there are signs she might be about to blow it in the governor's race against Republican Charlie Baker: She's struggled to raise money, and has run a lackluster campaign. But she can still put it in the past with a win that would propel her to the top job in one of the most liberal states in the country. If she loses, it's hard to see her generating any enthusiasm for another campaign for higher office. 6. Can embattled Republicans Michael Grimm and Vance McAllister defy the odds and hold their House seats? Grimm (R-N.Y.) is under indictment on tax and business fraud allegations. McAllister has become known as the \\"kissing congressman\\" after being caught on camera kissing a staffer who was not his wife. Yet both of them stand a fighting chance of winning. McAllister is using the same \\"politics of forgiveness\\" playbook Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) used in his successful comeback. Grimm has insisted he is innocent, and enjoys a base of support that doesn't seem to be too moved by the allegations he is facing. 7. Which 2016ers will walk away with the most IOUs? This will be a bigger question once the election is over and the dust has cleared. There's no better way to set yourself up for 2016 than making important friends in 2014. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has been playing nice with the establishment, backing mainstream Republican contenders left and right. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has raised boatloads of money for Republican candidates and barnstormed the country as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Others, like Hillary Clinton (D) and Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) have also pitched in for their party. It won't be long before they all try to collect on their unofficial IOUs. Sean Sullivan has covered national politics for The Washington Post since 2012. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"As the midterm campaign reaches its final days, the Senate majority remains a critical issue, while potential runoffs in Louisiana and Georgia could keep the focus on these races for months after the election. Meanwhile, gubernatorial seats remain contentious, prominent figures face crucial points in their careers, and embattled House candidates may still hold their positions, all creating an intriguing backdrop for potential 2016 candidates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Are the following two questions the same? Why do men like women's butts? How does the shape of a women's butt matter in sexual pleasure? Do men like cute or hot women?","output":"No, the two questions are not the same; they address different aspects of attraction and sexual preferences. However, both questions belong to the realm of human sexuality and interpersonal attraction. Let's analyze each question individually, discussing the reasons men might be drawn to a particular preference. 1. Why do men like women's butts? How does the shape of a women's butt matter in sexual pleasure? Men's attraction to women's butts can be explained from evolutionary, biological, and cultural perspectives.  From an evolutionary standpoint, men may be drawn to a woman's butt due to the correlation between hip-to-waist ratios and fertility. The lower a woman's hip-to-waist ratio, meaning smaller waist and wider hips, the more fertile she is believed to be, which could be an advantageous characteristic for a mate. Biologically, the sight of a curvaceous or rounded buttocks can induce an arousal response in men, as it signifies both fertility and physical fitness. The shape of a woman's buttocks is determined by muscle and fat distribution, with some studies speculating that men prefer a more balanced fat distribution, resulting in a firm but proportional buttocks shape. From a cultural perspective, various societies and social norms have idealized the shape of a woman's buttocks, making it a desirable trait. Media and fashion industries can further contribute to defining and reinforcing such preferences. As for sexual pleasure, the physical shape of a woman's buttocks may not directly impact sexual satisfaction for either partner. However, men might derive psychological pleasure from the visual appeal of a preferred buttocks shape, which could contribute to overall arousal and enjoyment. 2. Do men like cute or hot women? Preferences for \\"cute\\" or \\"hot\\" women are subjective and vary amongst individuals; these traits are not mutually exclusive, and might appeal to different men at different times or in different circumstances. \\"Cute\\" typically refers to a more youthful, innocent, or approachable aesthetic. This trait could be appealing to men who find comfort in nurturing or protective instincts. Additionally, cuteness can evoke positive and comforting emotions, which may foster a desire for emotional intimacy and attachment. On the other hand, \\"hot\\" generally denotes a sexually attractive appearance connoting maturity and confidence. Men who prefer a \\"hot\\" aesthetic might place a stronger emphasis on physical attraction and sexual experiences. A woman with a \\"hot\\" appearance might exude a sexual mystique and magnetism that can be enticing to men. In summary, the two questions are not the same but fall under the broader theme of attraction and sexual preferences. The first question deals primarily with the physical attraction to women's butts and its potential impact on sexual pleasure, while the second question delves into preferences for types of attractiveness, specifically \\"cute\\" versus \\"hot\\" women. Preferences across individuals will inevitably differ, shaped by factors such as biology, personal experiences, and cultural upbringing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But this idyllic 12th century church could not survive the fire that ripped through it hours before last Sunday's service. The once-iconic wooden vestry was destroyed, leaving its bells missing amid the rubble. Almost destroyed: The original roof and many pews were destroyed in the blaze that tore through the church. Firefighters battled the blaze for an hour at St Andrews Church in Romsey, Hampshire, just three-and-a-half hours before its regular Sunday service. Too dangerous for them to go inside, they used six pumps to put out the flames and stayed for several hours to prevent the fire flaring again. Only some of the church's treasures, including an irreplaceable 1613 'chained' Bible, were saved. A 13th century wooden chest was badly damaged and a limestone font, with graffiti from 1681, was severely damaged, possibly beyond repair. The West Window, in memory of a much-loved churchwarden Bill Watkinson, was destroyed. The bells of St Andrews Church in Romsey, Hampshire, the same ones from 1212, have been lost in the rubble. Around half of the roof at the west end has been gutted but the east end is relatively unscathed, including a 13th century screen. Churchwarden Catherine Baker said: 'I can't really believe it. 'I was called by a neighbour who saw smoke and I could hear the crackling. I feel absolute horror. 'The most shocking thing was seeing the flames. As far as I know we have never had a fire before. 'If the fire brigade had not got here the roof would have been completely destroyed. 'They have been wonderful, as have all the neighbours who raised the alarm. 'My husband Bill and daughter Isabel, who were first on the scene, saw things falling off the roof. Church warden Catherine Baker, standing outside, is distraught after the church's first fire in 900 years. 'There was not a lot we could do.' Churchgoer Peter Pritchett-Brown said: 'It is awful to see something like this happen to something that has stood here for so long.' The little 20 metres by eight metres church was due to hold a Sunday service at 11am for its 20 regular worshippers. However, parishioners gathered for prayers in a nearby house with Rev Canon Steve Pittis. The alarm was raised at 7.27am and the cause of the blaze is unclear and is still being investigated. Nobody was injured. Fire borough commander Dan Tasker said: 'The damage is quite extensive. 'The fire started at one end and spread into the roof and, unfortunately, half has been destroyed.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - There is a rain cloud in the sky - Small bits of ice within the cloud bump each other - The collisions create electrical charge - Lighter, positively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud - Heavier, negatively charges particles rise to the top - When the positive and negative charges grow large enough, a giant spark, called lightning occurs -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wind spreads more spores happens, how will it affect an increase in positive particles at the bottom of the cloud.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests a change in the initial conditions of the process, which, in this case, is the spreading of more spores due to the wind. To understand if this perturbation would have an effect on the presence of positive particles at the bottom of the cloud and the subsequent lightning occurrence, let's first delve deeper into the mechanisms involved in charge buildup within clouds and how spores may potentially influence them. Rain cloud formation typically starts with water droplets condensing around aerosols, which can be natural particles like dust, pollen, or spores. These microscopic particles, called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), serve as the basis for the growth of water droplets within the cloud. As the cloud develops and temperature drops, some of these water droplets freeze into ice particles. As you described, the collisions between small ice particles take place within the cloud, with lighter and positively charged particles settling toward the bottom, while heavier and negatively charged ones rise to the top. This charge separation creates an electric field within the cloud and on the ground below. When the difference in electrical charge between the cloud and the ground becomes significant enough, lightning occurs, discharging the built-up electrical energy. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis, let's evaluate whether the presence of more spores due to increased wind will have a direct or indirect impact on the charge buildup within the cloud. Spores, when introduced as aerosols, can influence cloud formation by serving as additional CCN. This can potentially lead to higher droplet concentrations within the cloud and ultimately, a higher number of ice particles. However, the actual charge separation process mainly depends on the physics of interaction occurring between ice particles, as well as temperature and other environmental factors. While the increased concentration of spores and the consequent increase in ice particle count might slightly alter the frequency and intensity of these interactions, it is unlikely to have a significant direct influence on the overall charge separation process. The primary component of the question's hypothesis is the possibility that the presence of more spores will specifically increase the positive charge concentration at the bottom of the cloud. Yet, since the charge separation mechanism predominantly relies on factors like the size, shape, and relative motion of ice particles in connection to collision processes, a larger number of spores would not necessarily translate to a sizeable change in the distribution of positive charges. In conclusion, while the supposed perturbation in this hypothesis might result in more ice particles (and subsequently increase the number of collisions within the cloud), it is unlikely to have a strong direct or indirect effect on the charge separation process that leads to lightning occurrence. Thus, the introduction of more spores due to wind may not significantly impact the concentration of positive particles at the bottom of the cloud. However, more research and detailed analysis could help provide a comprehensive understanding of the subtle interplay between spores and cloud electrification."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Identify the most salient words in this sentence: green peach hanging on a small branch with leaves","output":"The most salient words in the given sentence are: 1. Green: This color word acts as an adjective, helping the reader to visualize the appearance of the peach. It also implies that the peach is not yet ripe, as ripe peaches tend to have more orange or reddish hues. 2. Peach: This is the primary subject of the sentence and the central object being described. The peach is a fruit that grows on trees and is the focus of this statement. 3. Hanging: This verb demonstrates the position of the peach relative to its surroundings, indicating that it is suspended from a surface and supported by the branch. It informs the reader of the peach's location and the way it is attached to the tree. 4. Small: This adjective describes the size of the branch and suggests a relationship between the peach and branch. It gives greater context to the peach's positioning on the tree and highlights that it is not attached to a large or sturdy branch. 5. Branch: This noun represents the tree's extension on which the peach is hanging. Branches typically grow from the trunk and provide support and structure to the tree, allowing for leaves and fruit to grow. The branch is an essential aspect of the peach's environment and is crucial in understanding the setting of the sentence. 6. Leaves: These plural nouns represent the green, flattened structures that grow on the branches and stems of plants. In this sentence, they provide context regarding the setting, implying that the peach is situated among the leaves. Leaves are crucial to the life of a tree, as they are its primary source of photosynthesis, converting sunlight into energy for the plant to grow and thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.  - Stephan Groth ( born August 10 , 1971 in Odense , Denmark ) is the man behind Apoptygma Berzerk , an electronic body music act that plays in styles such as synthpop , ebm , and futurepop . Stephan Leonard Groth was born in Odense , Denmark but relocated with his family to his father 's home town Sarpsborg , Norway in 1986 . Along with Ronan Harris of VNV Nation and the members of Covenant , he is considered by many to be one of the pioneers of the futurepop genre of the late 1990s and early 2000s . Groth is also a member of Fairlight Children , which is a lighter , more pop - oriented electronic act . Stephan took guest appearance in Satyricon 's album Megiddo .  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).  - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.  - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - VNV Nation is an English/Irish electronic music band originally from Dublin and Essex and now based in Hamburg, Germany. They combine elements of synthpop, trance and electronic body music (EBM). The members are Ronan Harris and Mark Jackson. The \\"VNV\\" in the name stands for \\"Victory Not Vengeance\\", in keeping with the group's motto, \\"One should strive to achieve, not sit in bitter regret.\\"  - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature.  - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.  - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).  - Icon of Coil is a Norwegian electronic music band. The band was established as a solo project in 1997 by Andy LaPlegua who was joined by former Sector 9 (now Moonitor and Zombie Girl) bandmate Sebastian Komor to perform live. With the release of \\"Shallow Nation\\", the band's first single, Komor joined full-time. In 2000, Christian Lund joined the live lineup. Later that year the band's first full-length album, \\"Serenity is the Devil\\", was released, which climbed to number one on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Shortly thereafter, Lund became a full-time band member.  - Unheilig (German for \\"Unholy\\") is a German band that features a variety of influences including various pop and electronic styles as well as harder, nihilistic hard rock. The band was founded in 1999 and principally consists of singer Bernd Heinrich \\"Der Graf\\" Graf along with various musical partners. He has been accompanied for live shows with musicians Christoph \\"Licky\\" Termühlen, Henning Verlage, and Martin \\"Potti\\" Potthoff. The group's debut, \\"Phosphor\\", came out in 2000.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - Sarpsborg , historically Borg, is a city and municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Sarpsborg.  - Beborn Beton is a German synthpop band founded in 1989, with their first album release in 1993. Their debut named \\"Tybalt\\" is a compilation of the best tracks written in the first three years of their band history and was very well received in the electronic music scene. In 1995 the follow-up album \\"Concrete Ground\\" was released. After a change of record label in 1996 their break-through album \\"Nightfall\\" was published featuring the club-filler \\"Im Innern Einer Frau\\".  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...  - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark. It has a population of 175,245 as of January 2016, and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album \\"The Second Annual Report\\", they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\"; \\"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\\".  - Hans Christian Andersen (often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen; (2 April 1805  4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called in Danish, express themes that transcend age and nationality.  - Apoptygma Berzerk (commonly abbreviated to APB or APOP) is a Norwegian musical group. They have achieved success with a brand of synthpop, and ballads backed with electronic rhythms, commonly known within the scene and referring to themselves as \\"futurepop\\". Apoptygma Berzerk has over 30 releases and won awards and Top 10 spots in Germany and Scandinavia. Apoptygma Berzerk has toured Europe, North America, South America, Israel and Australia with bands such as VNV Nation, Beborn Beton, Icon of Coil and Unheilig.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Electronic body music (EBM) is a music genre that combines elements of post-industrial music and electropunk. It first came to prominence in Belgium and was considered a part of the European new wave movement.  - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.  - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.

At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London.  - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London.  - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament.  - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \\"habeas corpus\\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles. The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the American Constitution in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States. Research by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries.  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament  taxation, legislation and policy-making  but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.  - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th centurywhen it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdomsuntil 1707, when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.  - Middlesex is a former United Kingdom Parliamentary constituency . It was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of England , then of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 , and finally of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1885 .  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland.  - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - The Middle Saxons or Middel Seaxe were a people whose territory later became, with somewhat contracted boundaries, the county of Middlesex, England. It included the early London settlement, and probably Surrey, the \\"south region\\" of the Middle Saxon territory.     What is the relationship between 'middlesex ' and 'united kingdom of great britain and ireland'? A:","output":"Middlesex is a county in southeast England, which was a distinct administrative and political entity until 1965. Since then, most of its area has become part of Greater London, with small parts in neighbouring counties. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom, is a sovereign country that includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Therefore, Middlesex, at its current state as part of Greater London, is within the United Kingdom. Prior to 1801, when the Kingdom of Great Britain was combined with the Kingdom of Ireland to form United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Middlesex was part of the Kingdom of Great Britain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two triangles can be proved similar by the angle-angle theorem which states: if two triangles have two congruent angles, then those triangles are similar. [substeps] This theorem is also called the angle-angle-angle (aaa) theorem because if two angles of the triangle are congruent, the third angle must also be congruent. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? There are ways to tell if triangles are similar Select from the following.  -- Yes  -- It's impossible to say  -- No","output":"Yes, the given text does suggest that there are ways to tell if triangles are similar. The primary method mentioned is the angle-angle (AA) theorem, which states that if two triangles have two congruent angles, then those triangles are similar. This theorem is also known as the angle-angle-angle (AAA) theorem because if two angles of a triangle are congruent, the third angle must also be congruent. To prove similar triangles using the AA theorem, follow these steps: 1. Identify the corresponding angles in the two triangles that are being compared. This can be done by examining the relationships between the sides and angles of each triangle or by using shared or adjacent angles in the figure. 2. Determine if the identified angles in the triangles are congruent. Two angles are congruent if they have the same measure or can be proven to be the same through a previous step in the proof or by using other congruent angles in the figure. 3. If two corresponding angles are congruent, then according to the AA theorem, the triangles are similar. This is because if two angles of a triangle are congruent, the third angle must also be congruent, making all three angles in the triangles match. In addition to the AA theorem, there are other methods for proving triangle similarity, such as the side-side-side (SSS) and side-angle-side (SAS) similarity theorems. The SSS similarity theorem states that if the three sides of one triangle are proportional to the three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are similar. The SAS similarity theorem states that if two pairs of corresponding sides in two triangles are proportional and the included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar. In summary, the given text does imply that there are ways to tell if triangles are similar, with the primary method mentioned being the angle-angle theorem. Other methods, such as the side-side-side and side-angle-side similarity theorems, can also be used to prove triangle similarity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Show your business plan to established lawyers.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Crafting a Comprehensive Business Plan: An Essential Guide for Entrepreneurs An executive summary presents an overview of your business prospects and functioning aspects, creating an impetus for potential investors to delve deeper into your business plan. It is a concise summary of what your business is about, its core values, and the strategic plans to achieve your goals. Ideally, it includes an introduction to your company, a summary of your business structure, the services you plan to provide, and reasons why your business will be successful. Firstly, the description of your firm shapes the first impression of your potential investors. This portion must be impeccably written and encapsulate the essence of your enterprise. The company description section should include information about the nature of your business, its strategic location, the problems it plans to solve, and how it aims to provide solutions. For instance, if you are putting up a legal consultancy firm, detail how your firm can provide efficient and effective solutions that other businesses lack in resolving legal issues. The services you plan to provide are vital in defining the scope of your business. This section should describe the nature of services, elucidate how these services meet customer needs, discuss their pricing, and present a comparison of your services with those of similar businesses. Next, commencing a market analysis will elucidate the viability of your business concept. This analysis involves assessing your industry's size and structure, examining market trends, evaluating your competition, and identifying your target market. It will also assist in identifying your Unique Selling Proposition, thereby making your business stand out among competitors.  Your business plan must illustrate an organizational structure, describing the hierarchal setup of your company, job roles of team members, and how your business operations flow. This delineates who should be held accountable for decision-making processes and provides tangible evidence of your company's readiness for the investment. Furthermore, details about ownership also form an integral part of your business plan. It demonstrates who owns the business, the ownership structure (whether it's a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or LLC), and the percentage of ownership each investor holds.  The marketing strategy is significant for understanding how to acquire customers, retain them, and ensure continuous growth in business. It should cover your sales forecast, sales and distribution plan, communication plan, and more. This section often includes details about marketing expenditures, market positioning, and return on investments. Your business plan should also include a financial outlook, projecting profits or losses. It should outline your business expenses, revenue model, profitability projections, and the time frame anticipated for turning a profit. This section gives potential investors a clear view of your business’s financial strength and stability. Consider including an appendix that serves as a repository for any additional supporting documents that are relevant but do not fit into the main body of the plan. It may include items such as credit histories, resumes of key managers, product pictures, legal documents, and contracts. Finally, before finalizing your business plan, forward the draft to established lawyers. This is to ensure legal compliance and minimize the possibility of overlooking critical legal frameworks. Lawyers can scrutinize the draft to spot and rectify legal pitfalls in your plan, thereby ensuring the lawful execution of your business. In conclusion, crafting a comprehensive business plan requires in-depth research, detailed planning, and laborious attention to detail. Your business plan is more than mere paperwork; it is a continuous and essential tool embodying the heartache, passion, and aspiration of your entrepreneurial journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side.

The move toward this more demanding standard has been slowly evolving.

Would \\"The rope is too short to do the entire route in one pitch (necessity).\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose from: (A). No; (B). Yes; The answer is:","output":"(A). No; Pitch in climbing refers to a section of a climb between two belay points, where the leader ascends, placing protection (either traditional gear or clipping quickdraws to bolts) and the follower ascends while taking in the protection. A climbing route can be divided into multiple pitches, with each pitch covering a certain section of the climb, depending on various factors such as the route's length, difficulty, and available protection. The leader belays the second climber at the end of each pitch, and they often swap roles to continue up the route. The rope length plays an important role in determining the number of pitches on a climbing route. Generally, one pitch length tends to not exceed half of the rope length (usually climbing ropes are between 50 and 80 meters long). This is to allow the belayer to lower the climber back down if required and to accommodate for rope stretch during falls. If a route is too long for one pitch, it will be broken into multiple pitches, and belay stations will be set up accordingly, ensuring that the rope does not run out during any part of the climb. Your example sentence could be restructured for better clarity: \\"The rope is too short to do the entire route in one pitch, necessitating dividing the route into multiple pitches.\\" By rephrasing the statement, it clarifies that the given rope length will not allow the climbers to complete the entire route in a single pitch, and the need to break it into multiple pitches arises."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

King said in her post-match press conference, \\"Today, I looked at the scoreboard when I was 2-0 in the third set and the '2' seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. In 1979, when I was up 2-0 at the same stage, I was tired and didn't have anything left. But today I felt so much better and was great mentally.\\" Two days later in the semifinals, which was King's 250th career match at Wimbledon in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles, the second-seeded Chris Evert defeated King on her fifth match point 7-6(4), 2-6, 6-3. King was down a set and 2-1 in the second set before winning five consecutive games to even the match. King explained that she actually lost the match in the first set by failing to convert break points at 15-40 in the second and fourth games.  She reached the semifinals in her final appearance at Wimbledon, losing to Andrea Jaeger 6-1, 6-1 after beating Kathy Jordan in the quarterfinals, seventh-seeded Wendy Turnbull in the fourth round, and Rosemary Casals, her longtime doubles partner, in the third round. Jaeger claims that she was highly motivated to defeat King because King had defeated Turnbull, a favorite of Jaeger's, and because King refused a towel from an attendant just before her match with Jaeger, explaining, \\"I'm not going to sweat in this match.\\"  King became the oldest WTA player to win a singles tournament when she won the Edgbaston Cup grass court tournament in Birmingham at 39 years, 7 months and 23 days after a straight-sets victory in the final against Alycia Moulton. The final official singles match of King's career was a second round loss to Catherine Tanvier at the 1983 Australian Open.","output":"This text is about Billie Jean King, a former professional tennis player who won numerous titles and awards throughout her career. Born in Long Beach, California into a conservative Methodist family, Billie Jean was part of an athletic family, with her mother excelling at swimming, her father playing basketball, baseball, and running track, and her younger brother becoming a Major League Baseball pitcher. The text mentions some of her achievements in the sport of tennis. In 1982, when King was 38 years old, she competed at Wimbledon as the twelfth seed. She advanced through the rounds, saving match points in her third-round match with Tanya Harford of South Africa, and upsetting higher seeded players like Wendy Turnbull and Tracy Austin. King's victory over Austin in the quarterfinals marked the first time she had beaten Austin in her career and made her the oldest female semifinalist at Wimbledon since Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers in 1920. Although King was defeated by second-seeded Chris Evert in the semifinals, she had an impressive 250 career matches at Wimbledon across singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. In her final appearance at Wimbledon, King reached the semifinals again, ultimately losing to Andrea Jaeger. It's interesting to note that Jaeger had additional motivation to win against King due to her friendship with Wendy Turnbull and a pre-match incident involving King and a towel. Towards the end of her career, Billie Jean King achieved the record of being the oldest WTA player to win a singles tournament at the age of 39 years, 7 months, and 23 days, when she won the Edgbaston Cup grass court tournament in Birmingham. King's final official singles match was a second-round loss to Catherine Tanvier at the 1983 Australian Open."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Is \\"The Byzantine term Sklavinoi was loaned into Arabic as Saqaliba صقالبة (sing.\\" the correct answer?","output":"To answer this question, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Check the meaning of the term \\"Sklavinoi\\" Step 2: Analyze whether \\"Sklavinoi\\" can be considered a 'disputed' Byzantine term Step 3: Evaluate if \\"Sklavinoi\\" was loaned into Arabic as \\"Saqaliba\\" Step 1: Checking the meaning of the term \\"Sklavinoi\\" \\"Sklavinoi\\" is a Byzantine term that referred to the Slavic people living close to the Byzantine Empire, particularly those located in the Balkans. The term was commonly used during the early Middle Ages. Step 2: Analyzing whether \\"Sklavinoi\\" can be considered a 'disputed' Byzantine term There seems to be no clear dispute regarding the term \\"Sklavinoi\\" as it pertains to its meaning or use in the Byzantine era. Its origin can be traced to the Greek term \\"Σκλάβοι\\" which itself derives from the Latin word \\"Sclavus\\" or \\"Slavus,\\" a term used to refer to Slavic people. However, the term is not identified as being highly disputed. Step 3: Evaluate if \\"Sklavinoi\\" was loaned into Arabic as \\"Saqaliba\\" Indeed, the Byzantine term \\"Sklavinoi\\" was loaned into Arabic as \\"Saqaliba\\" (صقالبة, singular: Saqlabi صقلبي). The Arabic term \\"Saqaliba\\" referred to Slavic people, particularly those who were captured and served in various capacities within Islamic societies during the medieval era. The term was used to describe Slavic slaves, soldiers, administrators, and eunuchs in the Islamic world. Conclusion: While the term \\"Sklavinoi\\" was loaned into Arabic as \\"Saqaliba,\\" it is not evident that the origin of the term \\"Sklavinoi\\" is highly disputed in the context of Byzantium. Thus, the correct answer might involve a different term or additional information about the dispute over the term's origin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"Two women hikers are looking out over a scenic bridge.\\" if \\"there are two females thinking something about scenic bridge\\"?","output":"In order to provide a detailed answer, we must first analyze the relationship between the two statements and the ways in which they describe the same scenario. The statements are: 1. Two women hikers are looking out over a scenic bridge. 2. There are two females thinking something about a scenic bridge. Let's break down each statement and examine the similarities and differences between them. Statement 1: - The subjects of the statement are two women who are identified primarily as hikers. - The action they are taking is \\"looking out\\" over the scenic bridge, which suggests they are observing and appreciating the view. - The words \\"scenic bridge\\" describe where the women are and their focal point. Statement 2: - The subjects are described as two females. This matches the gender reference in the first statement, but it doesn't mention whether they are hikers or not. - The action involves thinking about the scenic bridge. This is different from the first statement, which specifies that they are looking out over the bridge. The second statement leaves their physical position and the nature of their thoughts open to interpretation. - The reference to the \\"scenic bridge\\" connects the two statements and suggests that both refer to the same location. Now that we have analyzed the statements separately, we can determine whether it is possible to conclude that they describe the same situation. The subjects in both statements are women; however, the first statement identifies them as hikers, while the second statement does not provide this information. Additionally, the first statement implies a clear action and location—that the women are standing near the bridge, looking out over it—while the second statement only conveys that they are thinking about the bridge. Their thoughts, physical position, and whether they are actively looking at the bridge remain unclear in the second statement. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine with certainty that the two statements are describing the same scenario. The lack of information about the subjects' role as hikers and their physical position in the second statement leaves room for interpretation. It is possible that they are the same two women hikers, but it is also possible that they are two different females who are not hikers and are simply thinking about the scenic bridge. As a result, the two statements cannot be definitively connected without further context or information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After the Foreign Minister announce its denuclearization commitment. SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What is the term for the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid?   A: Answer:","output":"The term for the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid is called the \\"melting point.\\" The melting point is a specific temperature at which the solid phase of a substance becomes unstable, and its particles gain enough energy to overcome the forces holding them together, transitioning into the liquid phase.  At the melting point, the solid and liquid phases of a substance are in equilibrium, meaning that the rates of melting and freezing are equal. This balance ensures that as long as the temperature remains at the melting point, both solid and liquid can coexist. If there is an increase in temperature above the melting point, more particles gain energy, causing the entire solid to eventually melt. On the other hand, if the temperature goes below the melting point, the particles will lose energy and return to the solid phase as the liquid freezes. The melting point of a substance depends on multiple factors, including the molecular structure, bonding strength, and external pressure. In general, substances with strong intermolecular forces – such as ionic or covalent solid compounds – tend to have higher melting points than those with weaker forces, like van der Waals interactions that are found in molecular compounds. External pressure can also influence the melting point. As pressure increases, the melting point may increase as well, since the particles need more energy to overcome the increased force pushing them closer together. However, this relationship may vary depending on the specific substance. Different substances have unique melting points. A well-known example is water, which has a melting point of 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under normal atmospheric pressure. Other common substances and their melting points include:  - Ice, the solid phase of water: 0°C (32°F) - Table salt (sodium chloride): 801°C (1474°F) - Iron: 1538°C (2800°F) - Gold: 1064°C (1947°F) In practical applications, the melting point is a crucial characteristic that helps to determine the suitable usage of various materials. For instance, it is essential to consider the melting points of metals when choosing materials for building elements that will be exposed to high temperatures, such as in electric wiring or construction of engines. In summary, the melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid. This point is determined by the substance's molecular structure, bonding strength, and external pressure, making it an essential property to consider in both scientific research and practical applications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Telmatosaurus (meaning \\"marsh lizard\\") is a genus of basal hadrosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was a relatively small hadrosaur, approximately five meters (16 ft) long, found in what is now Romania.   - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU.  - The Late Cretaceous (100.566 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the Cretaceous period is divided in the geologic timescale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time.  - The tibia (plural tibiae or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and it connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula, and closer to the median plane or centre-line. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of the leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute \\"tibia\\". It is the second largest bone in the human body next to the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body.  - The femur (pl. \\"femurs\\" or \\"femora\\" ) or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the hip joint) bone of the [leg] in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the hindlimbs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Orthomerus ( meaning \`\` straight femur '' ) is a genus of duckbill dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of The Netherlands and Belgium . It is today an obscure genus , but in the past was conflated with the much better known Telmatosaurus .  - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.  - A hindlimb is a posterior limb on an animal, especially the quadrupeds. When referring to quadrupeds, the term hind leg is often instead used.  - In humans, the thigh is the area between the pelvis and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Hadrosaurids (\\"hadrós\\", \\"stout, thick\\"), or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. This group is also known as the duck-billed dinosaurs, for the flat, duck-bill appearance of their mouths. The family, which includes ornithopods such as \\"Edmontosaurus\\" and \\"Parasaurolophus\\", was a common herbivore in the Upper Cretaceous Period of what is now Asia, Europe, Antarctica, South America and North America. Hadrosaurids are descendants of the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout. Like the rest of the ornithischians, these animals had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosaurids are divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (\\"Lambeosaurinae\\"), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes, and the saurolophines, identified as hadrosaurines in most pre-2010 works (\\"Saurolophinae\\" or\\" Hadrosaurinae\\"), which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines are divided into Aralosaurines, Lambeosaurines, Parasaurolophines and Tsintaosaurines, while Saurolophines include Saurolophus, Brachylophosaurines and Kritosaurines.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.  - The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. The knee joint is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.    What entity does 'orthomerus' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (; German: ['gotlo:p 'fre:g@]; 8 November 1848 - 26 July 1925) was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician. He is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics. Though largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers. Frege matriculated at the University of Jena in the spring of 1869 as a citizen of the North German Confederation. In the four semesters of his studies he attended approximately twenty courses of lectures, most of them on mathematics and physics. His most important teacher was Ernst Karl Abbe (1840-1905; physicist, mathematician, and inventor). Abbe gave lectures on theory of gravity, galvanism and electrodynamics, complex analysis theory of functions of a complex variable, applications of physics, selected divisions of mechanics, and mechanics of solids. Abbe was more than a teacher to Frege: he was a trusted friend, and, as director of the optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, he was in a position to advance Frege's career. After Frege's graduation, they came into closer correspondence.  His other notable university teachers were Christian Philipp Karl Snell (1806-86; subjects: use of infinitesimal analysis in geometry, analytical geometry of planes, analytical mechanics, optics, physical foundations of mechanics); Hermann Karl Julius Traugott Schaeffer (1824-1900; analytical geometry, applied physics, algebraic analysis, on the telegraph and other electronic machines); and the philosopher Kuno Fischer (1824-1907; Kantian and critical philosophy).  Starting in 1871, Frege continued his studies in Gottingen, the leading university in mathematics in German-speaking territories, where he attended the lectures of Rudolf Friedrich Alfred Clebsch (1833-72; analytical geometry), Ernst Christian Julius Schering (1824-97; function theory), Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804-91; physical studies, applied physics), Eduard Riecke (1845-1915; theory of electricity), and Hermann Lotze (1817-81; philosophy of religion). Many of the philosophical doctrines of the mature Frege have parallels in Lotze; it has been the subject of scholarly debate whether or not there was a direct influence on Frege's views arising from his attending Lotze's lectures.  In 1873, Frege attained his doctorate under Ernst Christian Julius Schering, with a dissertation under the title of \\"Ueber eine geometrische Darstellung der imaginaren Gebilde in der Ebene\\" (\\"On a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in a Plane\\"), in which he aimed to solve such fundamental problems in geometry as the mathematical interpretation of projective geometry's infinitely distant (imaginary) points.  Frege married Margarete Katharina Sophia Anna Lieseberg (15 February 1856 - 25 June 1904) on 14 March 1887.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did he study at Jena?","output":"Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege studied at the University of Jena, where he matriculated in the spring of 1869.

Hypothesis: Child playing with a hula hoop in his home .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"After carefully examining the information provided, it is not possible to conclusively confirm or deny the hypothesis based on the given premise. The premise states:   \\"Child playing with a hula hoop on a cement driveway in housing allotment.\\" This statement describes a particular scenario where a child is playing with a hula hoop on a cement driveway which is situated in a housing allotment. A housing allotment is an area of land that is divided into smaller plots for individual residential houses or other buildings. In this scene, the child is outdoors, and the specific location is a cement driveway, which could be a common space shared by residents in the housing allotment or could belong to a specific house. The hypothesis suggests: \\"Child playing with a hula hoop in his home.\\" This statement focuses on a child playing with a hula hoop within the confines of his own home. The word \\"home\\" generally refers to an individual's residence, which could include both indoor and outdoor areas, like a front yard, patio, or backyard. There is a relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, as both statements describe the same activity - a child playing with a hula hoop - which implies that they might be referring to the same situation. Moreover, housing allotments often consist of individual homes, which further connects the two statements. However, it is essential to notice that the hypothesis is less specific than the premise. The premise establishes a clear location for the scene: a cement driveway within a housing allotment. In contrast, the hypothesis simply refers to the child playing at home, with no reference to a driveway or the housing allotment. Furthermore, while the hypothesis assumes that the child is playing in his own home, the premise doesn't provide information on whether the driveway where the child is playing is a part of his home or if it is a shared space within the housing allotment. Given the available information, the link between the premise and the hypothesis is not strong enough to establish a definite connection. Therefore, we cannot conclusively accept or reject the hypothesis based solely on the premise. To determine if the hypothesis can be accepted, additional information regarding the child's residence, whether the cement driveway is a part of his home or a common space in the housing allotment, and any other relevant contextual details would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Testifying on the second day of Holmes' preliminary hearing, Garrett Gumbinner said Holmes booby-trapped his apartment with explosives and triggering devices that would be tripped when the front door was opened. The explosive devices included homemade napalm, thermite, and glycerin Holmes designed to mix with potassium permanganate, a mix of metal powder and oxides, igniting a fire or explosion. Holmes had also set up a detonator outside of his Aurora apartment building, hoping someone would come along and trigger the device, normally designed to control a remote-controlled toy car.      Gumbinner's testimony underscored the elaborate planning Arapahoe County District prosecutors contend Holmes used to carry out a premeditated massacre at Aurora's Century 16 Cineplex in the early hours of July 20. The preliminary hearing will determine if there is sufficient evidence to try Holmes on more than 160 charges of first degree murder and attempted murder.      CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The state of Colorado continues to hear overwhelming evidence against Aurora theater shooting suspect James Holmes. (Jan 8.) KUSA      Gumbinner detailed how Holmes rigged his apartment's entryway with fishing line, tied to a thermos bottle in the kitchen. When the door was opened, it was designed to knock over the thermos containing glycerin and positioned above a pan filled with potassium permanganate. When combined, the chemical reaction sets off sparks. Holmes apartment was filled jars of napalm and other incendiaries. Even the carpet was soaked with gasoline and oil, which set ablaze, would have intensified the carnage, Gumbinner said.      Police were alerted to his apartment by a neighbor who heard loud music Holmes had pre-programmed to play on his computer. Holmes also told arresting officers -- who found him in police style protective gear by his car at the rear of the theater -- that there were explosives at the apartment. Authorities later disarmed the devices without mishap.      Aurora Police detectives and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) Supervisor Steven Beggs outlined a series of purchases Holmes made beginning on May 10, when he bought two teargas grenades online from an on-line supplier. He later purchased tactical gear, the chemicals used for explosives, nearly 6,300 rounds of ammunition and four weapons found at the theater; a semi-automatic assault rifle, pump-action shotgun, a laser-guided pistol and a second handgun in the weeks leading up to the shootings.      All of the items were purchased legally at Denver area stores or through Internet dealers from California to Maryland. Aurora Police Detective Craig Apple, who has supervised Holmes' case, later testified that 76 shots were fired in the theater, including 65 from the assault rifle, six from the shotgun and five from a Glock pistol. The weapons have the same serial numbers as those purchased by Holmes between May 22 and July 6, Apple said.      Apple also testified that following his arrest, Holmes acted irrationally at a detention facility, at one point, taking a staple from a desk and trying to insert it into wall electrical outlet. At another point, Holmes made puppet motions with his hands, which had been covered with bags before they were tested for gunshot residue.      Holmes' attorneys say their 25-year-old client, a University of Colorado doctoral program dropout, suffers from mental illness and have indicated they will mount an insanity defense. Holmes, who dropped out in June after failing an oral exam, was seeing a school psychiatrist.      But prosecutors -- who wrapped up the witness portion of their case late Tuesday -- summoned Aurora Police Detective Tom Wilton to testify earlier in the day that Holmes had shown premeditation not just by his weapons purchases, but when he opened accounts with online dating services match.com and AdultFriendFinder.com weeks before the shootings.      His dating profiles were headlined \\"Will You Visit Me In Prison?\\"      Wilton's testimony drew some snickers from the courtroom audience, which included shooting victims and family members. But Holmes, bound at the hands and feet and flanked by several armed sheriff's deputies, again sat impassively through testimony. Except for briefly rocking his chair in a sideways motion for a few minutes Tuesday afternoon, Holmes stared straight ahead.      Earlier in the hearing Tuesday, witnesses testified about some of the chilling 911 calls that came from the theater as the shooting began.      Detective Randy Hansen said there were 41 separate calls within the first few minutes of the shooting.      The first call to police played in court came from inside the theater from Kevin Quinonez at 12:38 a.m. Hansen said during the 27-second call he heard at least 30 gun shots. The call came in 18 minutes into the showing of The Dark Knight Rises.      Police also played a 911 call from Kaylin Bailey, the teenage cousin of 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, the youngest person killed. Veronica's mother, Ashley Moser, was also shot. She miscarried after the shooting and is partially paralyzed. Bailey frantically called emergency dispatchers, who tried to talk her through administering CPR. As screams filled the theater, a panicked Bailey sobbed, said she couldn't hear and couldn't do it.      Some courtroom witnesses dabbed their eyes during the tape. Holmes stared straight ahead as the call was played, showing no emotion.

The attention would cause someone to jostle the door. The door would tug the fishing line. The line would topple the thermos full of glycerin, and the glycerin would mix in the frying pan with the potassium permanganate to create a flame.      The flame would set the petroleum-soaked carpet on fire. The fire would light the fuses. The fuses would detonate the jars filled with either homemade thermite, smokeless powder or stove-top napalm mixed with bullets.      The nonexplosive ammonium chloride powder sprinkled across the floor by the front door was there just to create smoke and scare the police.      And that, FBI agent Garrett Gumbinner testified Tuesday in the second day of preliminary hearings in the Aurora theater massacre, was one of two active — but untriggered — explosive systems that detectives found inside suspect James Holmes' apartment.      \\"The whole apartment would have either exploded or caught fire,\\" Gumbinner said.      After an opening day of dramatic testimony about the July 20 shooting that left 12 dead and 58 wounded, prosecutors and defense attorneys focused their attention Tuesday on the crux of the case: Is Holmes a calculated killer or mentally ill?      Through the testimony of several investigators, prosecutors spent the day seeking to show a depth of forethought and planning to the attack. And, in cross-examination, defense attorneys hinted even more openly that they intend to argue his actions were driven by mental illness.      Advertisement      The hearing — which serves the relatively banal purpose of determining whether there is enough evidence against Holmes for him to face trial on 166 counts of murder, attempted murder, explosives possession and committing a crime of violence — could end as early as Wednesday. Prosecutors said Tuesday afternoon that they are on their last witness.      Gumbinner was one of two detectives who interviewed Holmes the afternoon following the early-morning shooting, hoping to learn how to safely defuse the explosive tangle they say he created.      \\"He said he rigged his apartment to explode and catch fire,\\" Gumbinner said of Holmes. \\"He said he was hoping to send resources to his apartment rather than the theater. By resources, I mean law enforcement.\\"      In addition to Gumbinner, an Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent detailed the 16 separate purchases Holmes is accused of making to acquire the four guns; 6,295 rounds of rifle, shotgun and handgun ammunition; dozens of gun magazines; ballistic gear; weapon slings; two laser sights; two tear-gas canisters; hundreds of practice targets; explosive chemicals; fireworks supplies; handcuffs; and a military first-aid dressing.      Family members of victims in the Aurora theater shooting arrive for court Tuesday morning, January 8, 2013, in Centennial. (RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post)      ATF agent Steven Beggs said the purchases — all from online retailers or the Gander Mountain and Bass Pro Shops sporting goods stores in the metro area — began May 10 and ended July 14. There were five purchases in the first week of July alone.      An Aurora detective also testified about two online dating profiles Holmes placed on the websites Match.com and Adult Friend Finder. Detective Tom Welton said Holmes, in both profiles, asked the same question: \\"Will you visit me in prison?\\"      But, as prosecutors sought to establish premeditation in the attack, Holmes' attorneys also revealed more of their strategy.      Thomas Teves, left, and his wife Caren Teves arrive for court, Tuesday, January 8, 2013, in Centennial. The Teves' son, Alex, died in the theater shooting. (RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post)      After prosecutors finished questioning Beggs, defense attorney Tamara Brady asked him whether it was illegal, for instance, to buy body armor or tear gas. Beggs said it wasn't in Colorado.      \\"Is there any process in place in Colorado,\\" Brady persisted, \\"to screen out whether a severely mentally ill person is purchasing these items?\\"      Beggs said no.      In afternoon testimony, Aurora homicide Detective Craig Appel testified that police did not request a blood sample from Holmes after he was arrested. He said Holmes' pupils were wide, but that \\"I saw no indication that he was under the influence of anything.\\"      But under defense questioning, he said Holmes' behavior was at times odd while he was under observation.      Paper bags had been placed over his hands to preserve evidence and Holmes played with them as though they were puppets, Appel said. He also tried to place a staple into an electrical socket, he said.      Throughout Tuesday, there were reminders of the human tragedy that brought Holmes and the victims' families together in the same courtroom.      Early in the day, prosecutors played a 911 call from a panicked 13-year-old girl.      Two of her cousins — police later determined they were Ashley Moser and Moser's 6-year-old daughter, Veronica — had been shot. They needed help, the girl told the dispatcher between sobs. The noisy chaos of the theater filled the background.      \\"Kneel beside your cousin,\\" the dispatcher instructed the girl.      \\"I can't hear you,\\" her voice pleaded back. \\"I'm so sorry.\\"      The girl began to cry.      \\"Ma'am, we need to start CPR,\\" the dispatcher began again.      \\"I can't,\\" she said.      \\"I will walk you through the steps,\\" the dispatcher said.      The call ended with police arriving. They could not save Veronica.      Tuesday's portion of the hearing concluded with Aurora Sgt. Matthew Fyles on the witness stand, going name by name through a list of wounded victims and detailing their injuries.      Two were paralyzed.      One lost his leg.      One was eviscerated but lived.      One suffered permanent brain damage.      One miscarried after the shooting.      Two others were pregnant and have since given birth.      When prosecutor Karen Pearson reached her question about Ethan Rohrs, who was 4 months old when the shooting occurred, she paused.      \\"Was Ethan Rohrs a baby?\\" she asked Fyles.      \\"Yes,\\" replied Fyles, his voice worn with emotion from reading the list. \\"He still is.\\"      John Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/john_ingold ||||| A detective says the alleged gunman in the Colorado theater shooting acted strangely in an interview soon after the attack.

Defense attorney Daniel King asked whether Holmes had been tested for drugs or other substances. Appel said there was no indication that he was under the influence of anything.      Appel acknowledged that Holmes' pupils' were dilated, something that had also been noted by the officer who arrested him.      THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.      An elaborate booby trap system allegedly set up to pull police away from the Colorado theater shooting included improvised napalm and thermite, which burns so hot that water can't put out the blaze.      FBI bomb technician Garrett Gumbinner described the system Tuesday at a hearing in which prosecutors laid out their case against suspected gunman James Holmes.      He said three different ignition systems were found in Holmes' apartment. There was a thermos full of glycerin leaning over a skillet full of another chemical. Flames and sparks are created when they mix, and a trip wire linked the thermos to the door.      Police said Holmes hoped loud music would lure someone to the apartment.      Prosecutors are trying to show in what is expected to be a weeklong hearing that the attack that killed 12 and wounded dozens July 20 was a premeditated act and that Holmes should stand trial.      Defense attorneys say he is mentally ill.      Daniel King, one of Holmes' lawyers, on Monday pointedly asked a pathologist who had just detailed each of the fatalities: \\"You're aware that people can be found not guilty on the grounds of insanity?\\"      When officers arrived at the theater, they found Holmes standing next to his car. At first, Officer Jason Oviatt said, he thought Holmes was a policeman because of how he was dressed but then realized he was just standing there and not rushing toward the theater.      Oviatt said Holmes seemed \\"very, very relaxed\\" and didn't seem to have \\"normal emotional reactions\\" to things. \\"He seemed very detached,\\" he said.      After arresting Holmes, Officer Justin Grizzle asked him if anyone had been helping him or working with him. \\"He just looked at me and smiled ... like a smirk,\\" Grizzle recalled.      So far, the trial has focused on the horror Aurora police officers discovered at the theater. The magnitude of the attack could be heard in the first 911 call to police, played Tuesday in court. It lasted 27 seconds and police say at least 30 shots could be heard.      The call came in 18 minutes into the showing of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\".      Police also played a 911 call from a teenage cousin of 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, the youngest person killed. A dispatcher tried to talk her through CPR but she sounded panicked and said she couldn't hear.      A bearded and disheveled Holmes stared straight ahead as the calls were played and didn't show any emotion.      Holmes also showed little emotion on Monday as police officers struggled to hold back tears during their testimony, reciting a litany of heartbreak: discovering a 6-year-old girl without a pulse, trying to keep a wounded man from jumping out of a moving police car to go back for his 7-year-old daughter, screaming at a gunshot victim not to die.      \\"After I saw what I saw in the theater _ horrific _ I didn't want anyone else to die,\\" Grizzle said.      Holmes watched intently as one detective showed a surveillance video of him calmly entering the theater lobby, holding the door open for a couple behind him, and printing out tickets to the midnight showing of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" that he purchased electronically nearly two weeks earlier. Authorities did not show a video of the attack but say Holmes, wearing body armor, tossed two gas canisters into the packed theater, then opened fire.      The hearing will be the best opportunity yet for survivors to find out about Holmes' mental state and the sequence of events that led up to the attack. It comes weeks after a shooting at a Newtown, Conn., school killed 20 children and six adults and increased scrutiny on the combustible mix of firearms and mental illness.      Holmes is charged with more than 160 counts, including murder and attempted murder. The hearing will allow the judge to determine whether the prosecution's case is strong enough to warrant a trial, but it's rare for a judge not to order a trial if a case gets this far.      Legal analysts say that evidence appears to be so strong that Holmes' attorneys may seek a plea agreement before trial.      While prosecutors have yet to decide on whether they will seek the death penalty, such a plea could get Holmes a lesser sentence, such as life in prison; help the state avoid a costly trial; and spare survivors and families of those who died from the trauma of going through a lengthy trial.      ____      Associated Press writers Thomas Peipert and Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"An FBI explosives expert, Garrett Gumbinner, testified in a preliminary hearing in Centennial, Colorado, that mass murder suspect James Holmes rigged his apartment with an extensive array of homemade bombs, designed to cause significant damage and create a diversion from the July 20 shootings at a suburban Denver movie theatre that killed 12 and wounded or injured nearly 60 more.

The statement from the tour guides implies that the purpose of the red paste is to shield Hanuman from witnessing the more acrobatic than erotic carvings on the struts of the Jaganath Temple, which is located opposite to the temple in question. Hanuman is a central figure in Hindu mythology, revered for his strength, loyalty, and devotion. He is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva and is often associated with protection, righteousness, and victory over evil. In contrast, the carvings on the struts of the Jaganath Temple depict more acrobatic and erotic scenes, which might be considered as inappropriate and not in alignment with Hanuman's righteous nature. The red paste, as per the tour guides, is believed to act as a barrier that prevents Hanuman from seeing these carvings. This indicates that the red paste serves a functional and symbolic purpose, protecting the revered deity and preserving the sanctity of the temple. However, it's important to consider that the tour guides' explanation could be based on local folklore or cultural beliefs, without substantial evidence or historical background. Nonetheless, it remains a widely accepted interpretation of the use of red paste in this particular context, according to the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the red paste saves Hanuman from the sight on carvings on the struts of the Jaganath Temple appears to be true based on the tour guides' explanation and the cultural context surrounding this practice.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving.  - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others).  - An oven is a thermally insulated chamber used for the heating, baking or drying of a substance, and most commonly used for cooking. Kilns and furnaces are special-purpose ovens, used in pottery and metalworking, respectively.  - The Israelites (\\"Bnei Yisra'el\\") were a Semitic-speaking people of the ancient Near East, who inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods. The ancient Israelites are considered to be an outgrowth of the indigenous Canaanite populations that long inhabited the Southern Levant, Syria, ancient Israel and the Transjordan.  - Hebrew (\\"\\" or ) is a language native to Israel, spoken by over 9 million people worldwide, of whom over 5 million are in Israel. Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh. The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE. Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. The Hebrew language is the only living Canaanite language left.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"  - A Cheder ( alternatively , Cheider , in Hebrew  , meaning \`\` room '' ) is a traditional elementary school teaching the basics of Judaism and the Hebrew language .  - The Torah (\\"instruction, teaching\\"), or in Christianity, the Pentateuch (\\"five books\\"), is the central reference of the religious Judaic tradition. It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice. Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws (').  - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.  - The Talmud (Hebrew: ' \\"instruction, learning\\", from a root ' \\"teach, study\\") is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism. It is also traditionally referred to as, a Hebrew abbreviation of ', the \\"six orders\\", a reference to the six orders of the Mishnah. The term \\"Talmud\\" normally refers to the collection of writings named specifically the Babylonian Talmud \\"(Talmud Bavli)\\", although there is also an earlier collection known as the Jerusalem Talmud, or Palestinian Talmud\\"' \\"(Talmud Yerushalmi)\\". When referring to post-biblical periods, namely those of the creation of the Talmud, the Talmudic academies and the Babylonian exilarchate, Jewish sources use the term \\"Babylonia\\" long after it had become obsolete in geopolitical terms.  - The Tanakh (or ; also \\"Tenakh\\", \\"Tenak\\", \\"Tanach\\") or Mikra or Hebrew Bible is the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is also a textual source for the Christian Old Testament. These texts are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others). The traditional Hebrew text is known as the Masoretic Text. The Tanakh consists of twenty-four books.  - In Judaism, the midrash (pl. ') is the genre of rabbinic literature which contains early interpretations and commentaries on the Written Torah and Oral Torah (spoken law and sermons), as well as non-legalistic rabbinic literature (') and occasionally the Jewish religious laws ('), which usually form a running commentary on specific passages in the Hebrew Scripture (').

It was one of the happiest Saturday mornings I had spent with my little daughter, Gigi. That is, until two strangers threw her into their car and sped away. It seemed like a bad dream. I could barely whisper when the police questioned me. For hours we waited,but there was no word on the whereabouts of the car. Tears would start to come. Then nothing.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. (abbreviated as MGM or M-G-M, also known as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer or simply Metro, and for a former interval known as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists, or MGM/UA) is an American media company, involved primarily in the production and distribution of feature films and television programs.  Once the largest, most glamorous, and most revered film studio, MGM was founded in 1924 when the entertainment entrepreneur Marcus Loew gained control of Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures, and Louis B. Mayer Pictures. Its headquarters are in Beverly Hills, California. It is one of the world's oldest film studios.  In 1971, it was announced that MGM would merge with 20th Century Fox, a plan which never came into fruition. Over the next thirty-nine years, the studio was bought and sold at various points in its history until, on November 3, 2010, MGM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. MGM emerged from bankruptcy on December 20, 2010, at which time the executives of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, became co-chairmen and co-CEOs of the holding company of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  As of 2017, MGM co-produces, co-finances, and co-distributes a majority of its films with Sony Pictures, Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros.

He takes one path --- Republicans = bad --- and keeps riding. That's fine at one level. As far as I can tell, most of the facts are correct. The problem is what's missing. What's missing is the Republicans long-standing support for science and engineering. Republican-controlled White Houses and Congresses have been equally supportive in terms of doling out money.Also what's missing is wacko Sen. Harkin (D-Iowa) and his assault on real science. He essentially created the alternative medicine institute at the National Institutes of Health, and he's been disappointed that real science can't validate wacko flower and faith healing.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the author's perceived biases and points out what they believe is missing from the content. The reviewer appears to be open to reading about the subject matter, but feels that the book is not balanced and offers only a limited perspective. The reviewer criticizes the author for focusing only on the negatives associated with Republicans and not acknowledging their support for science and engineering. They also mention the absence of coverage on Democrats, such as Senator Harkin, who they believe have also contributed to the war on science due to their scientific ignorance.

Solve 289*x + 742*x - 15456 = -73*x for x.","output":"Sure, I can help you with that. Let's solve it step by step. Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. 289*x and 742*x are like terms, so we'll add them together: 289*x + 742*x = 289x + 742x = 1031x Now the equation looks like: 1031x - 15456 = -73x Step 2: Move the -73x term to the left side of the equation. To do that, we need to add 73x to both sides of the equation: 1031x + 73x - 15456 = -73x + 73x This simplifies to: 1104x - 15456 = 0 Step 3: Move the constant term to the right side of the equation. To do that, we need to add 15456 to both sides: 1104x - 15456 + 15456 = 0 + 15456 This simplifies to: 1104x = 15456 Step 4: Solve for x. Now, we just have to divide both sides by 1104: 1104x / 1104 = 15456 / 1104 This simplifies to: x ≈ 14 So, the solution to the equation 289*x + 742*x - 15456 = -73*x is x ≈ 14."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a summary based on this article: PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Wednesday renamed its Pacific Command the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, in a largely symbolic move underscoring the growing importance of India to the Pentagon, U.S. officials said.      U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis arrives to testify before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing on funding for the Department of Defense, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas      U.S. Pacific Command, which is responsible for all U.S. military activity in the greater Pacific region, has about 375,000 civilian and military personnel assigned to its area of responsibility, which includes India.      “Relationships with our Pacific and Indian Ocean allies and partners have proven critical to maintaining regional stability,” U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in prepared remarks.      “In recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, today we rename the U.S. Pacific Command to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,” Mattis said.      He was speaking during a change of command ceremony. Admiral Philip Davidson was assuming leadership of the command from Admiral Harry Harris, who is President Donald Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to South Korea.      The renaming does not mean additional assets will be sent to the region at this time, but rather recognizes India’s increasing military relevance for the United States.      In 2016, the United States and India signed an agreement governing the use of each other’s land, air and naval bases for repair and resupply, a step toward building defense ties as they seek to counter the growing maritime assertiveness of China.      Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said they had noted the name change.      “We will continue to pay attention to developments,” he told a regular monthly news briefing.      The United States is also keen to tap into India’s large defense market. It has emerged as India’s No. 2 weapons supplier, closing 15 billion worth of deals over the last decade.      Mattis has been pushing for a waiver for countries like India, after Trump signed a law last year which said that any country trading with Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors would face sanctions.      “I think India and the relationship with the United States is the potentially most historic opportunity we have in the 21st-century and I intend to pursue that quite rigorously,” Davidson, the incoming head of the command, said last month.      However, experts said the name change would mean little unless it was tied to a broader strategy.      “Renaming PACOM is ultimately a symbolic act ... (it) will have a very limited impact unless the U.S. follows through with a significant array of initiatives and investments that reflect a wider aperture,” said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under President Barack Obama. ||||| (CNN) The US announced Wednesday that it would rebrand the command responsible for overseeing US military operations in Asia, a move that comes amid heightened tensions with China over the militarization of the South China Sea.      US Pacific Command will now be called US Indo-Pacific Command, Secretary of Defense James Mattis said while speaking at a change of command ceremony in Hawaii, where the command's headquarters is located.      \\"In recognition of the increasing connectivity of the Indian and Pacific Oceans today we rename the US Pacific Command to US Indo-Pacific Command,\\" Mattis said.      \\"It is our primary combatant command, it's standing watch and intimately engaged with over half of the earth's surface and its diverse populations, from Hollywood, to Bollywood, from polar bears to penguins,\\" Mattis said of the command.      Adm. Harry Harris, who oversaw US military operations in the region until Wednesday, has been tapped by President Donald Trump to serve as the US ambassador to South Korea. Adm. Phillip Davidson will now lead the Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees some 375,000 US military and civilian personnel.

Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his... Answer:","output":"Friedrich"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Giants scored 28 points in the decisive second half to overcome a 10-point deficit. Rookie CB Aaron Ross made his presence felt with a crucial interception off of QB Chad Pennington with the Jets driving and up three in the third then sealed the win with an interception return for a touchdown late in the fourth. The Jets got off to a fast start as returning running back Brandon Jacobs fumbled and the Jets' Kerry Rhodes returned it for a TD. The Giants responded with a 9-play, 67-yard drive ending in a touchdown run by Derrick Ward. However, the Giants defense, susceptible to third down conversions the first week of the season struggled again today and allowed the Jets to drive 93 yards late in the half for a 14-7 lead. The Jets were 3 for 3 on third down on the drive including some big catches by Laveranues Coles. Pennington hit Brad Smith for a 16-yard touchdown. After a bad interception from Eli Manning, the Jets added a field goal by Mike Nugent for a 17-7 halftime lead. The Giants fought back, going back to the ground game to start the second half. Plaxico Burress added a 25-yard completion from Manning and Jacobs pounded it in for a 19-yard touchdown. The Jets responded as Leon Washington ran 98 yards for a touchdown. Big Blue again fought back, driving 68 yards featuring a mix of runs and passes. Jeremy Shockey notched his first touchdown of the season with a 13-yard catch and run bringing the Giants within three after three quarters. The Jets responded with a drive of their own including several third down conversions but rookie Aaron Ross made the first of several big plays including a deep interception. The Giants drove 99 yards, which ended with a spectacular 53-yard touchdown catch and run by Plaxico Burress, who stiff-armed a Jet defender down the sideline. With the Jets driving for a score, Ross struck again, intercepting Pennington and returned it 43 yards to clinch the win. Brandon Jacobs notched his first ever 100-yard rushing performance, Manning managed 186 yards and 2 touchdowns despite a poor first half, Osi Umenyiora added a sack and Sam Madison added his first interception of the season. The Giants had now won four straight regular season meetings against the Jets and improved to 3-2 on the season. How many points did the Jets need to tie this game?","output":"In this story, the Giants won the game with 35 points, while the Jets scored 24 points. So, if the Jets wanted to tie the game, they needed to have the same number of points as the Giants. Since the Giants had 35 points, the Jets needed 35 points too. To find out how many more points the Jets needed to tie, we can subtract the points they already had from the points they needed: 35 (points needed) - 24 (points they had) = 11 points. So, the Jets needed 11 more points to tie this game."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

What happens if a teeter-totter is balanced? Correct! It does not move. What about when its not balanced? Yes, it will now begin to move. Charges move when they are not balanced. Charges can build up by friction. Maybe you rub your feet on a wool mat or carpet. Rubber soled shoes readily gain charges. The wool carpet easily gives up charges. The two items become unbalanced. One item has a positive charge. The other has a negative charge. The difference in charge is called static electricity. Just like the teeter-totter, something is going to move. Positive charges build up on the mat. Negative charges build up on you.

Movie title: The Baader Meinhof Complex Context: The film begins on a nude beach in Germany in the late 1960s, where we are introduced to Ulrike Meinhoff, a respected journalist, and her family. Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance. Rudi Dutschke is then almost assassinated by a man who is accused to be from the Springer Group, which is tied to the German Government. In effect, many activists go to the Springer Group headquarters and riot. As we see there are many demonstrating protesters rioting around the world, Baader and Ensslin are in court confessing about the department store fires.

He was kind of a jokester, so when he told me that they were using a different cut of pork which isn't pork belly and it's kind of tough and dry, I thought he was joking. So I just laughed and was like \\"no, really, I want the pork belly\\". But apparently, he wasn't joking. I don't know why they insisted on serving this \\"roasted pork belly\\" with a different cut of meat rather than just removing it from the menu for the night. That was kind of strange and tells me a lot about this restaurant, in a negative light. Thank goodness the server warned me. I ended up going with the duck which was cooked medium rare I do believe, while my husband ordered the cheeseburger with the kim cheese fries, grilled bok choy, and kim chee fried rice.   The duck was... alright. It was definitely on the sweet side, and cooked medium rare, it was not that amazing. I'm used to eat duck confit, and Chinese roast duck. Compared to those, I'd say this was sub-par. They were just kind of sweet, extra chewy, pieces of duck breast. The grilled bok choy was a nice side. Having eaten boy choy many different ways growing up, grilling them was pretty unique, but the price was crazy. At a chinese market, you can buy 1lb of bok choy for probably 2. That would come with 10-15 spears. Here, you get 2-3 spears (they are all slices in half) for 7. I think I'll just grill my own bok choy at home next time. The kim chee fried rice tasted like any other kim chee fried rice I've had, and it came in a much smaller portion than I'm used to.   My husband's burger was weird. There was WAY too much cheese on it, with a strange sauce, and pickled cucumbers (like ban chan cucumbers) that he just didn't like. He didn't even eat more than 1/4th of it. He hated the kim cheese sauce (he said it tasted like cheese sauce mixed with Sriricha) but the fries were okay (it's pretty hard to mess up fries). Overall, I'd say we won't be back. This place is just an elegant place to eat poorly prepared and overpriced Asian cuisine. Was this review given positively or negatively?","output":"This review was given negatively.

Build a movie plot around this: What does April die from complications of? following the abortion","output":"Title: \\"A Fragile Spring\\" Genre: Drama Synopsis: \\"A Fragile Spring\\" revolves around the themes of love, loss, and hope in a small town where a tragic incident unveils hidden truths and unravels the lives of its residents. April, a smart, introverted, and compassionate high school senior, comes face to face with the most challenging decisions in her life that send her down an unexpected and painful path.  Act One: April, an intelligent yet introverted high school senior, is seemingly living a simple, uncomplicated life in a small rural town. She is an honors student with a close-knit circle of friends, including her best friend, Ruby. April lives with her loving single mother, Linda, who works tirelessly to provide for her. However, beneath the seemingly uncomplicated facade, April is pregnant, and the secret is eating her up inside. The father of the unborn child is none other than her boyfriend, Charlie, the charming and popular captain of the football team. In the beginning, she coyly tries to deal with the swirl of emotions by herself, but Ruby quickly takes notice and helps her confide in Linda.  Act Two: Overwhelmed and desperate, April's world takes a dark turn as she struggles with her emotions, the stigma attached to teen pregnancies in her conservative town, and her uncertain future. After deep conversations with her mother, Ruby, and Charlie, April makes the heart-wrenching decision to have an abortion. However, things take an unexpected turn, when April reveals her decision to Charlie. Her boyfriend feels guilty and tries to talk the couple into keeping the baby, but at last, Charlie accepts April's decision. In the heart of this act, we witness the interaction of these characters and their emotions towards this life-changing decision. Having made the gut-wrenching decision, April undergoes the abortion procedure with Linda and Ruby's unwavering support. The procedure seems to go smoothly, and April is relieved to put this chapter behind her. Charlie, on the other hand, feels conflicted and distances himself from April, unable to cope with his feelings of guilt.  Act Three: Unfortunately, April's story takes a tragic turn when she begins to experience severe pain and health complications shortly after the abortion procedure. April's desperate mother and close friends try to support her, but as they rushed to the emergency room to her worsening physical condition, April couldn't survive and quietly passed away due to unforeseen complications related to the abortion. As the news of her death spreads, the small town of residents is thrown into chaos, shock, and disbelief. April's death unveils hidden secrets of other girls in the town who experienced the same difficulty in their life but kept the truth hidden. Everyone begins to reassess their values, prejudices, and the hurt caused by keeping secrets. Charlie, who feels tormented by April's death, joins a support group and starts advocating for better sexual education and awareness. Despite the loss, April's death serves as a catalyst for change in the small town as town members start to mend relationships, seek forgiveness, and advocate for better healthcare and understanding for young girls experiencing similar struggles.  Conclusion: \\"A Fragile Spring\\" is a deeply moving story that showcases the tragedy and despair that can be brought about by certain decisions, along with the hope and change that can be born out of loss. The film would blend elements of romance, friendship, and tragedy, creating a heart-wrenching and powerful exploration of the importance of love, support, and understanding in the journey of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"Both of these questions essentially address the same objective, which is to learn ways to quickly acquire money. However, there could be a slight difference in the perspective of each question, primarily in the intent and methods implied. The first question might suggest generating income quickly in a broader sense, while the second question could emphasize on finding a method to instantly or rapidly earn money. Nonetheless, they both share the common goal of seeking quick monetary gains. To answer both questions, I will provide a detailed and long explanation of various methods to generate income quickly. 1. Freelancing: Offering your skills as a freelancer can help you make money fast. Platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr allow you to offer specialized services like writing, designing, programming, or marketing. As you build a solid reputation and gather positive reviews, you can raise your rates and secure more work. 2. Gig Economy: Take advantage of the growing gig economy by working for companies like Uber, Lyft, or DoorDash. These platforms allow you to earn money based on the hours you're willing to work and can provide considerable earning potential for people who are willing to put in the time. 3. Online Tutoring: If you have expertise in a certain subject, you can offer your services as an online tutor. Websites such as Tutor.com, Chegg, and VIPKid enable you to teach students from around the world and offer competitive pay rates. 4. Selling Items Online: Websites like eBay, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace allow you to sell unwanted items and earn quick cash. Additionally, creating and selling handmade items on Etsy or selling digital products on sites like Gumroad and Creative Market allows you to tap into niche markets and generate instant income. 5. Affiliate Marketing: By partnering with certain companies and promoting their products or services, you can earn a commission on every sale made through your unique referral link. Websites like Amazon Associates, Commission Junction, and ShareASale can connect you with relevant businesses in your niche. 6. Online Surveys and Market Research: Websites like Survey Junkie, Swagbucks, and Mechanical Turk pay you for completing online surveys, watching videos, or performing other small tasks. While it may not be the highest-paying option, it can provide consistent cash flow if you dedicate enough time to it. 7. Renting Out Assets: If you have extra space in your home or an unused vehicle, you can utilize platforms like Airbnb, VRBO, or Turo to rent these assets out to others, generating additional income with minimal effort required. 8. Peer-to-Peer Lending: By investing in peer-to-peer lending platforms such as LendingClub and Prosper, you can lend money to individuals or businesses, earning interest on loans that borrowers repay. This method requires some initial investment but can result in a continuous stream of income. 9. Short-term Investments: While not without risks, trading stocks, options, or cryptocurrencies can potentially yield quick profits. You'll need to carefully research investments and have a clear understanding of your risk tolerance before attempting these methods. 10. Offering Local Services: Providing services such as babysitting, dog walking, or lawn mowing within your community can be a source of immediate income. You can advertise your services on local online community boards, social media, or through word-of-mouth. Remember, not all of these methods guarantee instant wealth and may take some time to produce substantial income. Be cautious of any \\"get rich quick\\" schemes, as they often involve scams or illegal activities.

Article: Once upon a time if we wanted to make a phone call or wait for someone to contact us, we had to sit at home or at our desks. There were public phones in the street of course, _ . And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not?

To qualify this, I’m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies.

If you don’t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant.

Title: Von Richthofen and Brown Movie plot: Manfred von Richthofen (John Phillip Law) is a German cavalry officer newly assigned to an air squadron under the command of Oswald Boelcke (Peter Masterson). Richthofen quickly becomes an ace; his career is presented as a series of scenes intercut with those of another pilot across the lines, a Canadian named Roy Brown (Don Stroud), who arrives at a British squadron commanded by Victoria Cross holder Lanoe Hawker (Corin Redgrave). The two pilots are very different; Brown ruffles the feathers of his squadron mates by refusing to drink a toast to Richthofen, while the Baron awards himself silver trophies in honour of his kills, and clashes with fellow pilot Hermann GÃ¶ring (Barry Primus) when Boelcke is killed after a mid-air collision and Richthofen assumes command of the squadron. Richthofen becomes outwardly energized by the war. Outraged by an order to camouflage his squadron's aircraft, he paints them in bright conspicuous colours, claiming that gentlemen should not hide from their enemies. The toll on both squadrons is highlighted when Richthofen is wounded during an aerial battle and Lanoe Hawker is killed. The war becomes personal for both when Brown and his squadron attack Richthofen's airfield, destroying their aircraft on the ground. Revenge comes when Richthofen, with the help of a batch of new fighters from Anthony Fokker (Hurd Hatfield) launches a counterattack on the British airfield. Back at their aerodrome, Richthofen rants at GÃ¶ring for leaving the formation and strafing medical personnel. He says: \\"You're an assassin!\\" GÃ¶ring defends himself by saying: \\"I make war to win.\\" Richthofen tells him: \\"Get out of my sight!\\", threatening that if GÃ¶ring does something similar again, he will personally go to the Kaiser to make sure Goring is shot. Richthofen's passion for the war fades, becoming dismayed and depressed that his squadron is losing so many pilots. He even starts to realize that Germany might lose the war.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves.  suppose more conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more resources filling the pores occurs.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation in the given scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand this, let's first analyze the process mentioned: The process you are referring to is photosynthesis, which is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments. Photosynthesis involves converting light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This process can be summarized as follows: 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the leaves through small pores called stomata. 2. Water (H2O) is absorbed by the roots from the soil and transported through vessels in the stem to reach the leaves. 3. Sunlight is absorbed by the green pigment chlorophyll present in the leaves. 4. The absorbed light energy is used to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) through a series of biochemical reactions. Now, let's consider the situation where more conservation occurs and how it affects resources filling the pores: If more conservation efforts are made, it is likely that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere might reduce due to decreased human activities like deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. This would, in turn, affect the amount of CO2 available for the plant's photosynthesis process. Additionally, conservation may also contribute to an improved water supply, which could influence root absorption and water transport to the leaves. Furthermore, indirect factors such as temperature and humidity may also be impacted by conservation efforts. For instance, improved forest cover due to conservation efforts would consequently impact the microclimate of the area, which could indirectly affect photosynthesis rates. As the resources filling the pores (CO2) are impacted and other environmental conditions are changed by conservation efforts, it implies that the perturbation is indirectly impacting the steps of the photosynthesis process. The perturbation is not directly altering a specific step in the process, but rather affecting the availability of resources, both directly (CO2 availability) and indirectly (water availability and microclimatic conditions), which, in turn, influence photosynthesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

Menachem Begin ( listen ; Hebrew: m@nakhem be'giyn Menahem Begin, Polish: Mieczyslaw Biegun; Russian: Menakhem Vol'fovich Begin Menakhem Volfovich Begin; 16 August 1913 - 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel. On 17 May 1977 the Likud, headed by Begin, won the Knesset elections by a landslide, becoming the biggest party in the Knesset. Popularly known as the Mahapakh (\\"upheaval\\"), the election results had seismic ramifications as for the first time in Israeli history a party other than the Alignment/Mapai was in a position to form a government, effectively ending the left's hitherto unrivalled domination over Israeli politics. Likud's electoral victory signified a fundamental restructuring of Israeli society in which the founding socialist Ashkenazi elite was being replaced by a coalition representing marginalized Mizrahi and Jewish-religious communities, promoting a socially conservative and economically liberal agenda.  The Likud campaign leading up to the election centered on Begin's personality. Demonized by the Alignment as totalitarian and extremist, his self-portrayal as a humble and pious leader struck a chord with many who felt abandoned by the ruling party's ideology. In the predominantly Jewish Mizrahi working class urban neighborhoods and peripheral towns, the Likud won overwhelming majorities, while disillusionment with the Alignment's corruption prompted many middle and upper class voters to support the newly founded centrist Democratic Movement for Change (\\"Dash\\") headed by Yigael Yadin. Dash won 15 seats out of 120, largely at the expense of the Alignment, which was led by Shimon Peres and had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats. Well aware of his momentous achievement and employing his trademark sense for drama, when speaking that night in the Likud headquarters Begin quoted from the Gettysburg Address and the Torah, referring to his victory as a 'turning point in the history of the Jewish people'.  With 43 seats, the Likud still required the support of other parties in order to reach a parliamentary majority that would enable it to form a government under Israel's proportionate representation parliamentary system. Though able to form a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and ultra-orthodox parties, Begin also sought support from centrist elements in the Knesset to provide his government with greater public legitimacy. He controversially offered the foreign affairs portfolio to Moshe Dayan, a former IDF Chief of Staff and Defense Minister, and a prominent Alignment politician identified with the old establishment. Begin was sworn in as Prime Minister of Israel on 20 June 1977. Dash eventually joined his government several months later, thus providing it with the broad support of almost two thirds of the Knesset. While Prime Minister, Yehuda Avner served as Begin's speech writer.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what happened in 1977?","output":"In 1977, a significant political transformation occurred in Israel. On 17 May 1977 the Likud, a right-wing political faction led by Menachem Begin, emerged triumphant in the Knesset elections by a large margin, effectively ending the longstanding dominance of the left-wing Alignment/Mapai party. This event, widely referred to as the Mahapakh or \\"upheaval\\", drastically altered the political landscape as it marked the first time a party other than the Alignment/Mapai had won the ability to form a government. The success of the Likud represented a fundamental shift in Israeli society – one that saw the displacement of the incumbent socialist Ashkenazi elite by a coalition whose primary constituents were the previously marginalized Mizrahi and Jewish-religious communities. The Likud went into the election campaigning in a manner that placed heavy emphasis on Begin's modest and pious personality, which resonated with many Israeli citizens who felt neglected by the ruling party's agenda. In areas heavily populated by Jewish Mizrahi working-class individuals, as well as in peripheral towns, the Likud won decisive victories. Meanwhile, disillusionment with the reported corruption of the Alignment also led to many middle and upper-class voters turning to the newly founded centrist Democratic Movement for Change (\\"Dash\\") led by Yigael Yadin. As a result of this shift, the Alignment, led by Shimon Peres, saw its representation decrease from 51 to 32 seats. Aware of the historical significance of his victory, Begin, known for his flair for theatricality, compared his victory to the turning points mentioned in the Gettysburg Address and the Torah. He declared the electoral outcome as a 'turning point in the history of the Jewish people'. Despite winning 43 seats, the Likud was still in need of additional support from other factions to reach a parliamentary majority. To this end, although it formed a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and ultra-orthodox groups, Begin sought to increase his government's public credibility by extending his coalition to include centrist elements from the Knesset. In a controversial move, he offered the position of Foreign Affairs Portfolio to Moshe Dayan, a former IDF Chief of Staff and Defense Minister affiliated with the ousted establishment.  Begin was officially inaugurated as the Prime Minister of Israel on 20 June 1977. A few months later, the Democratic Movement for Change (\\"Dash\\") also joined Begin's government, aligning almost two-thirds of the Knesset with his government. Yehuda Avner served as Begin's speechwriter during his tenure as Prime Minister. This marked a key transformative moment in Israeli political history, encapsulating the upheaval that took place in 1977."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read this: Due to great differences in terrain, the climate of the province is highly variable. In general it has strong monsoonal influences, with rainfall heavily concentrated in the summer. Under the Köppen climate classification, the Sichuan Basin (including Chengdu) in the eastern half of the province experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa or Cfa), with long, hot, humid summers and short, mild to cool, dry and cloudy winters. Consequently, it has China's lowest sunshine totals. The western region has mountainous areas producing a cooler but sunnier climate. Having cool to very cold winters and mild summers, temperatures generally decrease with greater elevation. However, due to high altitude and its inland location, many areas such as Garze County and Zoige County in Sichuan exhibit a subarctic climate (Köppen Dwc)- featuring extremely cold winters down to -30 °C and even cold summer nights. The region is geologically active with landslides and earthquakes. Average elevation ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 meters; average temperatures range from 0 to 15 °C. The southern part of the province, including Panzhihua and Xichang, has a sunny climate with short, very mild winters and very warm to hot summers.

A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low.  and a hint : When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs  Please answer this question : In which reaction will the sodium hydroxide dissolve faster?

What is the answer for the question: What position at the paper would Henry be leaving if he went to work at the New York Sentinel? from the following article ?  The film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the metro editor of the New York Sun, a fictional New York City tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of experiencing the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. The paper's owner, Graham Keighley, faces dire financial straits, so he has Alicia Clark, the managing editor and Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's wife Martha, a fellow Sun reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she really dislikes Alicia Clark. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the Sun and become an assistant managing editor at the New York Sentinel, another fictional newspaper (based on The New York Times), which would mean more money, shorter hours, and more respectability, but might also be a bit boring for his tastes. Minor subplots involve Alicia, Bernie, and Sun columnist Michael McDougal. McDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar (later in the film) leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall. Alicia, who is having an affair with Sun reporter Carl and has expensive tastes, schemes to get a raise in her salary. Bernie reveals to Henry that he has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which causes him to spend time tracking down his estranged daughter Deanne White, in an attempt to reconcile before his time is up. Answer:","output":"The position that Henry Hackett would be leaving at the New York Sun if he went to work at the New York Sentinel is the metro editor position.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If any signs or symptoms last for more than two weeks or quickly get worse, then contact your doctor or dentist as soon as you can. Unless your family physician is also an ear, nose, mouth specialist (otolaryngologist), then your dentist may be the better bet to start with because they can rule out any non-cancerous mouth problems more readily and then treat them to relieve your discomfort.  In addition to a mouth exam (including your lips, cheeks, tongue, gums, tonsils and throat) your neck, ears, and nose should also be looked at to determine the cause of your problem. Your doctor or dentist will also ask you about risky behaviors (tobacco smoking and alcohol use) and your family history, as some cancers have a genetic link. Be aware that people over 40 years of age, especially if they are male and of African American descent, are considered at higher risk for oral cancers. Along with an exam of your mouth and throat, some dentists or doctors may use special oral dyes to better visualize abnormal areas in your mouth, especially if you are considered at higher risk for oral cancer. For example, one method uses a dye called toluidine blue.  Putting toluidine blue dye over a cancerous area in your mouth will make the diseased tissue stain a darker blue than surrounding healthy tissue. Sometimes infected or injured tissue also stains dark blue, so it's not a definitive test for cancer, just a visual guide. To be sure of cancer, a tissue sample (biopsy) needs to be taken and looked at under a microscope by a cancer specialist. This way you can get an accurate diagnosis. Another method of trying to distinguish healthy tissue from cancerous tissue in the mouth is by using special lasers. In general, when laser light is reflected off abnormal tissue, it looks different (duller) from light reflected off normal tissue. Another method uses a special fluorescent light to view the mouth after it's been rinsed with an acetic acid solution (vinegar, basically). Again the cancerous tissue stands out.  If an abnormal area of the mouth is suspected, a tissue biopsy is usually performed. Alternatively, sometimes the abnormal tissue can be evaluated by exfoliative cytology, where the suspected lesion is scraped with a stiff brush and the cells looked at microscopically. Summary:","output":"If you have a problem in your mouth that lasts more than two weeks, you should go see a doctor or dentist. They will look at your mouth, ears, nose, and neck to find out what's wrong. If they think you might have mouth cancer, they can use special dyes, lasers, or lights to see the bad area better. To be sure if it's cancer, they might have to take a tiny piece of the tissue and look at it under a microscope. It's important to talk to your doctor about any problems in your mouth, especially if you're an older person or have risk factors like smoking or a family history of cancer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you go to a sports game, a concert, or a bar in hopes of meeting someone in person, be bold. If approaching someone you're interested in isn't really your style, you can still make yourself look approachable and inviting.  If you see someone you’re interested in, but you can’t come up with a pickup line or a conversation starter, buy a drink for them and ask the bartender to tell them it’s from you. It’s hard to go wrong with a simple, kind gesture.  Make eye contact, smile, and raise your eyebrows – you just might make a connection from across the room. A lot of people who swear they hate dating probably only hate small talk. However, if you establish common ground through casual chatting, you’ll be able to discuss more serious topics, and the overall conversation will flow a lot more smoothly.  Ask broad, open-ended questions. Something like \\"So what got you interested in rock-climbing?\\" is a lot better than \\"Are you interested in rock-climbing?\\" If you meet in person, talk about where you are and what you're doing there. If you happen to meet someone playing beach volleyball, say something like: \\"Wow, you're really good. I'll know where to come in the future if I want my butt kicked. Do you play here often?\\" Relate to what the other person said. If they gripe about getting to work and you, too, have a difficult commute, express your shared frustration and tell them why you hate driving (or taking the bus or train). Nervous mistakes are simply a part of dating. You might trip over your words and say something you think is utterly stupid, or make an embarrassing typo while messaging on a dating app. Instead of taking yourself too seriously and letting the awkward moment get to you, try making a joke at your own expense. Luckily, some people think it's cute if their date is a little nervous. Don't go out with anyone who shows mild interest in you. People who are more discriminating tend to be seen as more desirable, and having standards shows that you value yourself and your time.  On the other hand, if you keep holding out for the perfect person, you might miss out on a great connection.  If you're in a room full of people with similar interests, you should be able to pick out one or two people who you'd like to go on a date with. Make it a point to not leave an event without showing interest, making a connection, or trading phone numbers with a few people. While swiping on an app like Tinder, take time to consider each potential match carefully, rather than turning them down based on an immediate gut reaction. Remember that there’s a real person behind that profile, and that you might make a great connection with them even if you’re not blown away by their photos. Treat people the way you would wish to be treated, online and off. If you start to suspect the person you’re talking to might not be right for you, they still might want to go out with you. If they ask you out and you’d rather not go, avoid making excuses like \\"I'm busy\\" or \\"I'm not ready to date right now.\\" These small lies can be more hurtful and insulting than just respectfully declining. Smile, say \\"No thanks, but I appreciate the offer\\", and change the subject to ease any discomfort. If you think your first interaction has gone well, ask the person out. By this time, you should have a good idea of what your potential date is interested in, or what they like to do for fun. Invite them to do something you think you would both enjoy.   If your date is lukewarm about trying new restaurants or bars, suggest a casual activity that’s relevant to what you’ve talked about with the other person instead of a dinner date. For instance, if they mentioned that they like a certain style of music, invite them to a concert you think they would enjoy. Have a good idea of what you’re going to say to the person so you don’t stumble over your words, but don’t memorize a statement ahead of time – you don’t want to sound scripted.  Be polite and graceful if they say no. Even if you feel hurt or disappointed, try not to take their answer personally. Thank them for being honest with you and tell them you enjoyed meeting them.

Fact 2: Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation.  Given the two facts above, what increases ultraviolet light? A:","output":"The increase in ultraviolet (UV) light is caused by the depletion of the ozone layer. The ozone layer, part of Earth's stratosphere, is rich in ozone (O3) which is a type of molecule that includes three oxygen atoms. This layer plays a crucial role by protecting Earth from the Sun's harmful UV radiation. The reason the ozone layer is so valuable is because of its ability to absorb the majority of the Sun's high-energy ultraviolet radiation—specifically, UV-B and UV-C. UV radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes various types of energy emanated from the Sun. While some amounts of UV-A radiation reach the ground level, the majority of UV-B and all UV-C radiation are absorbed by the ozone layer, ensuring the biological safety of living organisms on Earth.   When the ozone layer becomes thinner or when holes appear in it, which commonly happens over poles—particularly the South Pole—more UV radiation can get through. This phenomenon is known as ozone depletions. Ozone depletion is largely caused by the release of certain industrial chemicals, namely chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which can persist in the atmosphere for a long time. When these chemicals reach the stratosphere, due to weather patterns or natural atmospheric movement, they can catalyze the breakdown of ozone molecules, reducing the layer's protective capacity. In particular, under the influence of sunlight, CFCs can break down to release chlorine atoms. These chlorine atoms are capable of catalyzing the breakdown of ozone, resulting in a decrease in ozone high in the stratosphere. Over time, this process results in thinning of the ozone layer or ozone \\"holes\\". With less ozone in the atmosphere to absorb the UV radiation, higher quantities of this harmful radiation can reach the Earth's surface. Increased UV-B radiation at the Earth's surface is harmful to the DNA of all living organisms, leading to skin cancers and cataracts in humans, reduced crop yield, damage to phytoplankton (which forms the base of the ocean's food chain), and other detrimental effects. To summarize, the increase in ultraviolet light that reaches the Earth's surface is a direct result of the depletion of the ozone layer. This depletion is primarily driven by the emission of chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons that trigger the breakdown of ozone molecules in the stratosphere, thereby reducing the protective capacity of the ozone layer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, we will add up all the \\"u\\" terms on the right side. So we have 47*u and 20*u, and when we add them together, we get 67*u. So the equation becomes: 143*u - 1444 = 67*u 2. Now, we need to move all the \\"u\\" terms to one side of the equation. To do that, we will subtract 67*u from both sides. So we have: 143*u - 67*u - 1444 = 0 3. When we subtract 67*u from 143*u, we get 76*u. So the equation is now: 76*u - 1444 = 0 4. To find the value of \\"u,\\" we need to move the number -1444 to the other side of the equation. We will do this by adding 1444 to both sides: 76*u = 1444 5. Finally, we will find the value of \\"u\\" by dividing both sides by 76: u = 1444 / 76 6.

Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Where is a motorway likely to have tolls? Possible A: england, europe, city, new jersey, interstate  Why is \\"new jersey\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"New Jersey\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because: 1. Context: The question asks about a specific location where motorways are likely to have tolls. New Jersey, being a U.S. state, has a well-developed highway system that includes multiple toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. 2. Comparison: When compared to the other possible answers - England and Europe are both broader geographical locations, whereas \\"city\\" is a general term for an urban area, and \\"interstate\\" refers to a type of highway system in the United States. In this context, New Jersey serves as a more specific and identifiable location where toll roads can be found. 3. Practicality: Toll roads are often put in place to help generate revenue for maintaining and improving transportation infrastructure. New Jersey, being a densely populated state with significant commuter traffic, would stand to benefit from having tolls on its motorways in order to fund improvements and maintenance for its infrastructure. 4. Real-world examples: There are well-known toll roads in New Jersey, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, which are familiar to people from the area or who have traveled through the state. This real-world example of tolls in New Jersey aligns with human common sense, as people can easily recall or verify the presence of toll roads in the state."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Herkelman, who was 20-13 entering the tournament, and fellow 112-pounder Ottumwa sophomore Megan Black, who was 25-13, made history by being the first girls to qualify for the state tournament.

Write highlights for this article: It is the scourge of schoolchildren up and down the country. Classes can often be heard letting out a collective groan when the teacher mentions homework,  ruining plans for a night watching films or playing out with friends. However, this will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk -  because it has decided to ban all homework. Good news: Homework will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk -  because it has decided to ban it. This picture is posed by models. Instead, the 1100 children who will attend the Jane Austen Academy in Norwich will do longer days at school. The mixed free school for 11-18-year-olds - which will specialise in English and the humanities - is set to open in September 2014. The school yesterday unveiled its prospective principal, Claire Heald, who said that city children would do extra study at school as part of the extended day, which could last until about 5pm. She said: 'Rather than setting homework that pupils could go home and struggle with at home, and where there may be limited access to computers, they will do that as independent study in the day. 'We are saying that when they go home they should enjoy quality family time. 'There will not be any traditional homework - and that has been really well received by parents who respect the fact that family time will be family time.' New approach: The 1100 students who will attend the Jane Austen Academy will do longer days at school. The school's prospective principal, Claire Heald, is pictured. But Ms Heald said the school would still expect youngsters to study at home ahead of crucial exams. She's ready to create a new dramatic template in the UK after French president Francois Hollande called for the end of homework in primary schools last October. The French leader insisted independent learning at school would enhance equality because kids who get help with homework from parents have a huge head start. Since their introduction by the Coalition, dozens of free schools have opened - with many others in the pipeline. But they have proved controversial, with many providing alternative methods of teaching and education. At the Tiger Primary School in Maidstone, pupils have all-singing and all-dancing curriculum. Pupils have specialist teachers for Mandarin, music, gym, dance and games lessons. They also have access to a school farm and ecology woodland. Pupils at the Greenwich Free School in London spend a third more time learning than most school children. The school day lasts from 8am to 5.30pm. There are only 100 pupils in each year, which the school says means teachers get to know each pupil as an individual. The exciting initiative has already sparked keen interest from other headteachers in Norfolk. Peter Devonish, headteacher of Neatherd High School in Dereham, said: 'My initial thought is that it's really compelling. 'It sounds like a really good idea. 'Having the children on site a bit longer to consolidate their learning is a really good idea. 'The children can finish work and they can have their time with the family.' But he warned: 'I have got two stumbling blocks. 'One is our rurality and getting children home at that time, and the other is changing staff contracts so they can be here until 5.30pm. 'If you are a free school you do not have to conform in the same way.' Mr Devonish said they set pupils project-based homework, such as looking at an energy efficient house, which allowed them to combine independent study with working with their parents. Craig Morrison, principal of King's Lynn Academy, agreed that the whole prickly issue of homework should be looked at. Mr Morrison said: 'I can understand why people want to experiment with this because it is one I would not say anybody can say they have got definitively right over the years. 'And if they are starting a new school then it gives them the chance to try out new things.' He added: 'A large problem with homework, which we have tackled, has been that not enough is done with it. 'With homework, a lot of effort can go into it, so it's about celebrating what children do rather than processing it in terms of marking it and handing it back.' Highlights:","output":"1.

The new administration had already begun exploring possible diplomatic options, retracing many of the paths traveled by its predecessors.U.S. envoys again pressed the Taliban to turn  Bin Laden \\"over to a country where he could face justice\\" and repeated, yet again, the warning that the Taliban would be held responsible for any al Qaeda attacks on U.S. interests. The Taliban's representatives repeated their old arguments. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told us that while U.S. diplomats were becoming more active on Afghanistan through the spring and summer of 2001, \\"it would be wrong for anyone to characterize this as a dramatic shift from the previous administration.\\" In deputies meetings at the end of June, Tenet was tasked to assess the prospects forTaliban cooperation with the United States on al Qaeda.

Clarke and the CIA's Cofer Black renewed the push to aid the Northern Alliance. Clarke suggested starting with modest aid, just enough to keep the Northern Alliance in the fight and tie down al Qaeda terrorists, without aiming to overthrow the Taliban. Rice, Hadley, and the NSC staff member for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, told us they opposed giving aid to the Northern Alliance alone. They argued that the program needed to have a big part for Pashtun opponents of theTaliban. They also thought the program should be conducted on a larger scale than had been suggested. Clarke concurred with the idea of a larger program, but he warned that delay risked the Northern Alliance's final defeat at the hands of the Taliban. During the spring, the CIA, at the NSC's request, had developed draft legal authorities-a presidential finding-to undertake a large-scale program of covert assistance to the Taliban's foes.

I had reservations for a Saturday night dinner with my friends and the moment we walked into the door, we were warmly greeted by the attentive and courteous staff. The atmosphere inside is cozy and inviting, with soft lighting and elegant decorations that truly enhanced the ambiance. As we settled in, our knowledgeable server, Julie, took the time to walk us through the menu, sharing details about the ingredients, preparation methods, and her personal recommendations. We eagerly took her suggestions and were not disappointed in the slightest. For starters, we shared the artisanal charcuterie board which was a beautiful assortment of meats, cheeses, olives and bread that truly helped set the stage for what was to come. We also sampled the perfectly crispy, golden calamari, served with a tangy lemon aioli that only elevated the flavors even further. You may think our expectations were already high by then, but our main courses managed to impress us even more. I opted for the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, which was cooked to perfection, flaky and tender, and served over a bed of creamy risotto with seasonal vegetables. The delicate flavors were enhanced by the white wine lemon butter sauce, and I savored every last bite. My friends raved about their dishes too - the filet mignon, cooked exactly as requested and so tender it melted in your mouth, and signature truffled mushroom pasta, that provided a delightful symphony of creamy, savory, and umami-filled flavors. To crown our evening, we treated ourselves to a dessert like no other – the much-recommended chocolate lava cake accompanied by a scoop of velvety vanilla ice cream.

Justification: The introduction should grab readers' attention and indicate what they can expect to learn from the article. Introduction: The automobile, once regarded as a symbol of progress and human innovation, had its moment in the sun during the golden age of the World's Fair. In the mid-20th century, these grand exhibitions showcased cutting-edge technology and fascinating glimpses of what the future might hold. At the heart of this vision of tomorrow, cars took center stage, embodying the spirit of freedom, mobility, and infinite possibility. This article will explore how and why vehicles played such a prominent role in shaping the World's Fair, and the enduring impact of that legacy. Step 2: Discuss the historical background of the World's Fair and its connection with cars. Justification: Providing historical context helps readers understand the significance of the World's Fair and the role of automobiles during its peak. Historical Background: The inaugural World's Fair, known as the Great Exhibition of 1851, was held in London with the aim of demonstrating the latest advancements in industry, science, and art. As the 20th century rolled in, automobiles emerged as a major force in innovation, and many World's Fair exhibitions began to focus on showcasing new car models, designs, and technologies. From General Motors' futuristic Futurama exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair to Ford's Magic Skyway at the 1964 edition, cars soon became synonymous with the World's Fair experience. Step 3: Describe the various car exhibitions and attractions at different World's Fairs. Justification: By diving into specific examples, readers can better appreciate the range, grandiosity, and overall appeal of car-related exhibits at the fairs. Exhibitions and Attractions: - General Motors' Futurama at the 1939 New York World's Fair presented a vision of life in 1960, with automated highways facilitating efficient long-distance travel and cars reaching previously unthinkable speeds. - In 1958, the Brussels World's Fair showcased the experimental car Citroën DS 19, which astonished visitors with its sleek design, hydropneumatic suspension, and state-of-the-art braking system. - The 1962 Seattle World's Fair saw the debut of General Motors' Firebird III concept car, an early inspiration for the autonomous vehicle with its electronic steering and advanced ultrasonic sensors. - Ford's Magic Skyway at the 1964 New York World's Fair transported visitors in convertible Ford Mustangs on a journey through time, with highlights that included prehistoric landscapes and futuristic cityscapes. Step 4: Analyze the impact of the car-dominated World's Fairs on culture and industry. Justification: Highlighting the impact provides readers with an understanding of the lasting legacy of these events and their influence on the automotive industry. Impact and Legacy: The prominence of automobiles at the World's Fair not only brought public attention to emerging innovations but also drove the automotive industry itself to continuously push the envelope on design, performance, and technology. These grand exhibitions played a significant role in shaping public perception of the car as a symbol of progress, prosperity, and freedom. Moreover, many of the innovations showcased at the World's Fairs eventually found their way into mainstream car production, serving as a testament to the enduring influence of these events on the automotive landscape. Step 5: Conclude by reflecting on the relevance of the car's role in the World's Fair for today's context. Justification: Bringing the discussion back to the present day helps make the topic more relatable to and engaging for readers. Conclusion: In the 21st century, cars have evolved from being a luxury to an everyday necessity. Today, the focus of the automotive world has shifted to environmental sustainability, autonomous driving, and smart technologies. Although the era when cars ruled the World's Fair has passed, these events remain a powerful reminder of the pivotal role automobiles have played in shaping human progress and our vision for the future. As we now seek sustainable transportation solutions, the spirit of innovation that was once on display at the World's Fair continues to fuel new breakthroughs and drive us toward a more sustainable, connected, and accessible world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The resident priest called it the \\"garden of evil\\". The Indians now consider the volcano sacred. The group then arrives at the mine. They find John unconscious, and they free him. Before John wakes up, Hooker sets the man's broken leg.  When John regains consciousness, he accuses Leah of using him to get gold. Hooker talks to Leah later, about what her husband said; after he tells her that he has spotted signs of Apaches nearby, she offers him and the others all the gold they have dug up to take her husband away that night, while she remains behind to make it look like they are all still there. The cynical Fiske unexpectedly offers to stay with her, but when he asks her what he is to her, she tells him, \\"you're nothing at all, just nothing.\\", what would be the answer ?

Answer a question about this article: Dowding was summoned to an Air Ministry conference on 17 October 1940 to explain the poor state of night defences and the supposed (but ultimately successful) \\"failure\\" of his daytime strategy. The criticism of his leadership extended far beyond the Air Council, and the Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, and Churchill themselves intimated their support was waning. While the failure of night defence preparation was undeniable, it was not the AOC's responsibility to accrue resources. The general neglect of the RAF until the late spurt in 1938 had left sparse resources to build defences. While it was permissible to disagree with Dowding's operational and tactical deployment of forces, the failure of the Government and Air Ministry to allot resources was ultimately the responsibility of the civil and military institutions at large. In the pre-war period, the Chamberlain Government stated that night defence from air attack should not take up much of the national effort and, along with the Air Ministry, did not make it a priority. Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill's support of Dowding was what?","output":"In the article, it is mentioned that the support of Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill for Dowding seemed to be waning. This can be attributed to Dowding being summoned to an Air Ministry conference on 17 October 1940 to explain the poor state of night defences and the supposed failure of his daytime strategy. The criticism of his leadership extended far beyond the Air Council, and both Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill themselves appeared to be distancing themselves from Dowding. The failure of night defence preparation was, in fact, not the sole responsibility of the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) to accrue resources. The general neglect of the Royal Air Force (RAF) until the late surge in 1938 left minimal resources available to build defences. While it was reasonable for people to disagree with Dowding's operational and tactical deployment of forces, it should be noted that the ultimate responsibility for the failure to allocate resources fell on the government and the Air Ministry at large. During the pre-war period, the Chamberlain Government had stated that night defence against air attacks should not consume a significant amount of national effort. Both the government and the Air Ministry did not make it a priority. This context highlights how the waning support from Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill can be seen as somewhat unfounded, given that the responsibility for the shortcomings in night defence should have been shouldered more broadly by civil and military institutions, rather than laid solely at Dowding's feet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Railway electrification system: Modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and converted to a DC voltage to be used by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for. What type of losses happen during conversion and transmission in wires and electronics?","output":"During the conversion and transmission of electricity in wires and electronics, two main types of losses happen. First, there are \\"ohmic losses,\\" which happen in the wires due to the resistance of the materials being used. This means that when electricity flows through the wires, some of it turns into heat and is not used for making the train move.  Second, there are \\"magnetic field losses.\\" These happen in transformers and devices called smoothing reactors or inductors. Transformers and inductors help change electricity from one format to another, but while doing that, some of the energy gets lost in their magnetic fields and becomes heat too. So, both kinds of losses, ohmic and magnetic, mean that not all the energy taken from the power grid is used to make the train move as some of it turns into heat during the conversion and transmission processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: If weathering grinds rocks down, then what grinds rocks over time?  Answer choices: - deltas  - erosion  - Time and energy  - weathering  - Echinoderm.  - deuterostomes  - amoebae  - bullfrogs Answer:","output":"The process that grinds rocks over time is known as weathering and erosion. These are two environmental processes that break down the larger rocks into smaller particles. Weathering is the process where rocks and minerals on Earth's surface are broken down into smaller pieces or worn away. The process of weathering can transpire through physical or mechanical processes such as temperature change, frost, rainfall, wind, and the activities of organisms. It can also occur chemically when rocks interact with water, air, or certain substances in the environment. For example, acid rain can cause the weathering of rocks. This process helps in grinding the rocks but doesn't displace them from their original location. Over time, once the weathering process has broken down the rocks into smaller pieces, erosion then acts as nature's way of moving the sediments. Erosion is the transport of the weathered materials to different locations. Agents of erosion include water, wind, ice, or gravity. For instance, a river tends to carry along weathered rock particles and deposit them when the speed of the current slows. This process is a significant reason behind the formation of deltas mentioned in the answer choices. Similarly, glacial movements can erode large chunks of landscape and carve paths through mountains. In this context, time and energy also play roles as time defines how long the action of weathering and erosion has occurred, while energy describes the forces involved like the wind's speed, the water's flow rate, and the gravity's pull. However, the other answer choices such as Echinoderm, deuterostomes, amoebae, and bullfrogs are not involved in the process of grinding rocks over time. These are different types of organisms. Echinoderm and deuterostomes refer to specific phyla in the animal kingdom, including starfish and sea urchins for Echinoderm; some members of this group can somewhat break or grind down rocks, but this is minimal compared to weathering and erosion. Amoebae are single-celled organisms and bullfrogs are a type of amphibian; although they may have minimal impact on their immediate environment through dwelling habits, they don't play a significant role in grinding rocks over geological timescales. To summarize, weathering and erosion are the primary processes that grind rocks over time, and this happens over an extended period due to the energy put into the system. Other organisms and features may contribute to the transformation of the Earth's surface, but their impact is usually minor compared to these geophysical phenomena."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot Overview: In a small coastal town, Jake Simmons is a struggling singer and songwriter whose career is plagued by his crippling sore throat. Desperate for a cure, he visits countless doctors and alternative healers, but to no avail. One day, a mysterious old man tells him about a distant island where the inhabitants possess the secret cure for sore throats. Intrigued and desperate, Jake sets sail on a treacherous journey to find the elusive island. Upon arrival, Jake meets the Islanders and learns about their unusual and somewhat disturbing sore throat cure. The Islanders catch wild toads and place them in their mouths for a few minutes, transferring the toad's magical essence to the person in need.

Word spreads about Jake's extraordinary recovery, and soon the Islanders believe him to be the \\"Chosen One\\" who will save their island from an ancient curse that has tormented them for generations. This curse originates from a powerful spirit who is angered by the Islanders' practice of using toads for their magical powers. As Jake becomes more involved in island life, he begins to develop a deep connection with the Islanders and their culture. Eventually, he realizes that he possesses mystical abilities, including controlling the elements and communicating with the toad spirits. Jake decides to use his newfound powers to confront the vengeful spirit and break the curse, hoping to save the island and its people.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.  Paragraph: Two men in the Vietnam War needed to have their arms amputated. Unfortunately, the men were not able to be knocked unconscious for the operation. The doctor asked each patient if they wanted anesthetic injected into their arm or not. Marco replied that he wanted some, and Luke declined any anesthetic.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Whose nerve impulses will be transmitted? A:","output":"Based on the given information, Luke's nerve impulses will be transmitted. As he declined the anesthetic, his nerve impulses will not be disrupted, and he will likely sense pain during the amputation procedure. In contrast, Marco, who chose to receive the anesthetic, will have his nerve impulses disrupted, which prevents the transmission of pain signals during the surgery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When the action begins a young Chinese girl, Mei Li, and her father, Dr. Han Li, peer out a porthole in the ship as they sail into San Francisco harbor. They have stowed away in crates in the cargo hold of the ship. Later after the cargo has been unloaded onto the dock, Mei Li and her father climb out of their crates and wander the streets of San Francisco Mei Li thinks it is a wonderful city and must be a holy place since its named for a saint. They wander into a park, where they ask several people for help to find the address of Madam Fong who has chosen Mei Li as the bride for her son, Sammy. Even though most of the people in the park are Orientals, none of them can read Chinese. The newly arrived illegal immigrants have no money, so Mei Li proposes that she and her father give a show. She will sing a song with the flower drum: \\"A Hundred Million Miracles.\\" The lyrics sing about miracles occurring every day. During this rendition, she sings about the miracle of changing weather. The gathered crowd rewards their performance with money, but as they are collecting it a policeman asks if they have a license. After explaining that they are looking for the address of Sammy Fong, the policeman escorts them to Sammy's nightclub, the Celestial Gardens. Linda Low and several Celestial Gardens chorus girls perform \\"Fan Tan Fannie\\" as the floorshow. During the number Dr. Li, Mei Li and the policeman enter. The policeman asks to speak to Sammy. When this totally assimilated hipster arrives, he tells the officer that these are the folks he has been looking for and recognizes a photo of Mei Li that his mother had shown him. Sammy's mother is insisting on his union with a traditional Chinese girl in an arranged marriage. In the club's kitchen, Sammy feeds the starving immigrants. Mei Li likes American cooking, but Sammy is insulted; he contends his club serves the best Chinese cooking... Answer:","output":"Mei Li does not enter the United States legally.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Fergie and GoonRock recorded a song with Kamaal Ibn John Fareed whose stage name is? Answer:","output":"Fergie and GoonRock recorded a song with Kamaal Ibn John Fareed, who is widely known by his stage name, Q-Tip. He is a renowned American rapper, record producer, singer, and actor. Q-Tip gained initial fame as part of the critically acclaimed hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, which formed in 1985. Throughout his successful career, Q-Tip has worked with numerous talented artists and has been highly praised for his artistic contributions to the music industry. Q-Tip, whose real name is Kamaal Ibn John Fareed, was born on April 10th, 1970, in Harlem, New York City, United States. His stage name derives from the nickname he was given growing up – friends called him Q-Tip because of the shape of his afro. He later adopted this name for his musical career, which ultimately led him to stand out and be easily recognizable by fans and fellow artists alike. Fergie, born Stacy Ann Ferguson, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She gained fame as the female vocalist for the hip-hop group The Black Eyed Peas. Fergie has enjoyed tremendous success with the group and as a solo artist, releasing numerous chart-topping singles and albums. Her collaborations with various artists have also earned her several accolades and achievements in the music industry. GoonRock, whose real name is David Jamahl Listenbee, is an American record producer, musician, and songwriter. He gained significant recognition for his work on LMFAO's popular album titled \\"Sorry for Party Rocking,\\" where he contributed to some of the most successful tracks like \\"Party Rock Anthem\\" and \\"Sexy and I Know It.\\" The collaboration between Fergie, GoonRock, and Q-Tip demonstrates the versatility and creativity of these artists, as they come from different musical backgrounds and genres. Their combined expertise results in a unique fusion of sounds, showcasing the individual talents that each artist possesses. The song would likely feature a merge between hip-hop and electronic dance music, reflecting the distinctive styles that these artists are known for, respectively. Q-Tip's strong presence in the world of hip-hop aligns well with Fergie's dynamic vocal range, and when paired with GoonRock's infectious beats, the song has the potential to be an instant hit. Furthermore, this collaboration showcases the power of music in bridging differences, bringing together contrasting genres, and pushing the boundaries of artistic expression."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: All living things on the earth need other living things to live. Nothing lives alone. Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain  . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links   disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil   and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses. Each form of life is linked   to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger. Question: Which living things can use the sun's energy directly? Options: A: Animals. B: Plants. C: Animals and plants. D: All living things. A:","output":"The correct answer is B: Plants. The article clearly states that all life needs sunlight to live on, but only plants can utilize sunlight directly. Plants perform photosynthesis, a process through which they convert sunlight, in combination with water and carbon dioxide, into food. This process creates the base of most food chains, feeding other living organisms. Animals, unlike plants, are incapable of using the sun's energy directly. They rely on the food produced by plants or on other animals that have consumed plants. Thus, in the food chain, the sun's energy is transferred from plants to animals. Therefore, according to the information provided in the article, only plants have the ability to directly use the sun's energy. On a similar note, not all living things can directly utilize the sun's energy, which eliminates Option D. Rather, all living organisms depend on the conversion of the sun's energy into food by plants, forming complex food chains where energy is transferred from one organism to another."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Because the evening always starts with mass at 6 .. (3). Because Brianna likes Casey .. (4). Because last year they were always late because they did n't get off work early enough .. The answer:","output":"(3). Because Brianna likes Casey. The most plausible reason why Brianna would join the Youth Group just because Casey was in it is that she likes Casey and values their friendship or relationship. By joining the same group, Brianna has a chance to spend more time with her friend, strengthening their bond and shared experiences. This could also mean that she wanted to support Casey in their activities and interests by participating in the same group. It is also important to note that people often feel more comfortable joining new activities or groups when they know someone there. This familiarity aids in the transition into the new setting, making it easier to adjust and participate confidently. Brianna may have felt more at ease joining the Youth Group because she knew she would have Casey there to support her and help her navigate any social situations or challenges. While the other options might affect the overall experience or timing of the Youth Group, they do not directly explain why Brianna would base her decision to join solely on Casey's involvement. For instance, Option (2) refers to the evening always starting with mass at 6, but that is a general detail about the Youth Group, unrelated to Brianna's and Casey's relationship. Option (4) discusses schedule conflicts from the previous year, which again does not clarify why Brianna would decide to join due to Casey's presence. Therefore, the most accurate explanation for Brianna's decision to join the Youth Group because Casey was in it would be Option (3), as it addresses the significance of their personal connection and highlights the importance of friendship and support in such choices."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

They were able locate her after she secretly contacted her boyfriend of eight months in the UK before the wedding took place.

Leeds Crown Court heard the teenager was lured to the country on a sham holiday in July 2016.      She was rescued after she texted her location to her boyfriend, who then told West Yorkshire Police.      The parents, who cannot be named, were convicted of forced marriage.      They were also found guilty of one count of using violence, threats or coercion to force their daughter into marriage, following a three-week trial.      The two defendants were told by Judge Simon Phillips QC to expect \\"immediate imprisonment\\" when they are sentenced on 18 June.

'Disgusting'      The jury at the Leeds trial heard that the girl's parents had told her they were going on a six-week holiday to Bangladesh to visit relatives and celebrate Eid.      However, just days after arriving on July 3 2016, she was told by her father that he had found a husband for her.

The teenager, who was studying for her A-levels at the time, had told her mother that, even if she was forced to marry, she would file a report to authorities saying what had happened.      She told the jury: \\"But my mum said there was no way that that would happen, because they were going to leave me there for a year so that I would get pregnant so that he [the first cousin] could get a visa.\\"      With the help of her younger sister, she was able to contact the British High Commission, who rescued her days before the wedding was due to take place.

Given the question: Question: \\"Apostasy in Jehovah's Witness is the definition of what?\\"  Context: \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Apostasy in Jehovah's Witness is the definition of disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines or committing a serious sin, which can lead to a judicial committee determining guilt, providing help, and possibly administering discipline such as disfellowshipping, a form of shunning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He needs to escape and so he jumps into the back of a truck heading North out of the war. From this point on Bashu enters another reality in a remote farming village Gilan near the Russian border where the people are lighter skinned and speak a different language. There Bashu meets Naii (Susan Taslimi) and her children. By accepting him into her family as one of her own children, Naii poses the fundamental question we hear from the film - \\"Aren't we all children of Iran?\\" From out of war torn trauma, Bashu finds hope and trust with Naii's family.Parallels are drawn throughout the film between Bashu and Naii as culturally repressed figures in Iran. Bashu is a dark-skinned, Arab speaking boy, which at the time defied the Persian nationalism thought to unify the country.

He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed.  Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Answer:","output":"The paragraph does not provide specific birth rate data for either Village A or Village B. However, using the hint provided, we can infer that Village B likely had higher birth rates. This is because the Village B existed about 6,000 years ago, which is after the invention of agriculture around 10,000 years ago. The implementation of agriculture provided a more consistent food supply, allowed people to settle down, and as a result, increased birth rates. Village A, on the other hand, existed about 12,000 years ago, prior to the invention of agriculture, and so we can infer it probably had lower birth rates compared to Village B due to less stable food supply and less settled lifestyles."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His daughter, who was the executive producer for online operations at WLS, had worked for the Chicago ABC affiliate since 1999. That full life Jack Swaney spoke of included riding horses in Costa Rica and Turkey, driving cattle in Utah, and bicycling across Iowa, per her obituary—travels that may have worried other parents, but her dad took in stride. \\"As long as I heard her voice, I didn't care where she was,\\" he told WLS.

Since the late 1990s,Huntingdon Life Sciences--a company that conducts testing of substances on animals conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration--has become a proving ground for aggressive strategies by animal-rights militants  .At a hearing,a Senate.committee listened to testimony  against Huntingdon employees and financial institutions providing services to the company.One experimentation witness at the hearing insisted that any means necessary were justified  to spare animals' lives;he has previously accepted the idea of murder to that end. Use of animals in testing and in biomedical research continues to be necessary in many instances and is ethically preferable to experimenting on humans or giving up cures that could save human lives.But for the sake of people and animals alike,the development and acceptance of animal substitutes deserve enthusiastic support. In some instances, substitutes are already thought as good or better than animals,but supervising agencies have yet to catch up.In both the European Union and the U.S.,scientists and companies wanting to use the new alternative tests complain that regulatory standards for proving a drug or chemical to be safe for humans force the continued use of animals.Thus,animal-loving Americans might turn to persuading the EPA and the FDA to speed validation of new methods so that they can be more widely employed.And animal advocates  who want to influence business could consider investing in the small biotech's and large pharmaceutical  companies that are working to develop alternatives to animals in research.

The Turkish word for 'sovereign debt crisis' is 'süveren borç krizi', 'has worsened' can be translated as 'kötüleşti'. Together, they form \\"Süveren borç krizi kötüleşti\\". 2. \\"and the financial market turmoil\\": 'and' translates to 've' in Turkish. 'The financial market turmoil' is 'finansal piyasa karmaşası' in Turkish. So, joined with the previous part, it reads: \\"Süveren borç krizi kötüleşti ve finansal piyasa karmaşası\\". 3. \\"is set to dampen the real economy.\\": This part indicated an expected impact on the real economy due to the financial turmoil. 'is set to' can be translated as 'üzere', denoting an impending event. 'Dampen the real economy' is 'reel ekonomiyi sekteye uğratmak'.

A private American organization called Population Action International did the new study. It says more than three-hundred-thirty-five-million people lack enough water now. The people live in twenty-eight countries. Most of the countries are in Africa or the Middle East. P-A-I researcher Robert Engelman says by the year 2025, about three-thousand-million people may lack water. At least 18 more countries are expected to have severe water problems. The demand for water keeps increasing. Yet the amount of water on Earth stays the same. Mr. Engelman says the population in countries that lack water is growing faster than in other parts of the world. He says population growth in these countries will continue to increase. The report says lack of water in the future may result in several problems. It may increase health problems. Lack of water often means drinking waters not safe. Mr. Engelman says there are problems all over the world because of diseases, such as cholera, which are carried in water. Lack of water may also result in more international conflict. Countries may have to compete for water in the future. Some countries now get sixty percent of their fresh water from other countries. This is true of Egypt, the Netherlands, Cambodia, Syria, Sudan, and Iraq. And the report says lack of water would affect the ability of developing to improve their economies. This is because new industries often need a large amount of water when they are beginning. The Population Action International study gives several solutions to the water problem. One way, it says, is to find ways to use water for more than one purpose. Another way is to teach people to be careful not to waste water. A third way is to use less water of agriculture. The report also says long-term solutions to the water problem must include controls on population growth. It says countries cannot provide clean water unless they slow...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A New Vision for ‘Prince Igor’ at the Met It is common in contemporary opera for a director to update the setting of a story and impose some interpretive concept on a piece. Most directors do not go so far, however, as to reorder scenes, tweak the plot, excise whole ensembles and interpolate musical numbers from a different score. But the Russian director Dmitri Tcherniakov essentially does all of this in the Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Borodin’s “Prince Igor,” which opened on Thursday night. Yet his wonderful staging is dreamlike, wrenchingly human and viscerally theatrical. The impressive cast, with many Russian singers, is headed by the compelling bass Ildar Abdrazakov in the title role. If Mr. Tcherniakov takes big chances in this revelatory production, strong intervention is called for with “Prince Igor.” Borodin, a research chemist by profession, left the score in shambles when he died suddenly at 53 in 1887, having worked on the piece for 18 years. Rimsky-Korsakov, a respected Russian master, assisted by Glazunov, then a fledgling composer in his early 20s, salvaged Borodin’s original. They completed the orchestration, stitched segments together, fleshed out scenes left in sketches, and more. Their version became a beloved work in the Russian repertory, despite its flaws. Ildar Abdrazakov sings the title role in this scene from a recent dress rehearsal. At various times musicologists and conductors have sifted through Borodin’s reams of score pages and fashioned other versions. Still, it is impossible to know what the composer intended. The plot has big holes in it. Every production is a reclamation job. The Met’s may be the best of them. Working closely with the conductor Gianandrea Noseda, who led a vibrant and textured performance on Thursday, Mr. Tcherniakov has not so much condensed as concentrated the opera, which still runs for more than four hours (with two intermissions). Using vivid black-and-white silent-film segments created for the production, he brings the audience close to the singers and relates missing portions of the story. The libretto, written by Borodin, is based on an anonymous 12th-century epic poem. Actually, the basic plot is straightforward: Igor, an ancient Russian prince in the city of Putivl, gathers his army for a campaign against the nomadic Polovtsians, who have been ravaging the Russian territories. Igor’s troops are defeated, and he and Vladimir, his son, are taken captive. Vladimir falls in love with the sensual daughter of Khan Konchak, the ruler of the Polovtsians, who sees in his captive a potential ally, if only Igor will seek a truce. Vowing to continue the fight, Igor escapes. He returns to a city in ruins and feels like a failure. Still, his people hail his return. In this production, Mr. Tcherniakov emphasizes Igor’s self-doubting nature and insecurity. The opera is presented as Igor’s internal search for clarity, including dreamscape episodes in which he ponders what has happened. Mr. Tcherniakov, as is his practice, designed the sets. The prologue, in Putivl, takes place in a simple public meeting room with yellow-beige walls, a ceiling of wood beams and dangling electric lights. The people are gathered to send the soldiers, dressed in russet-colored uniforms (the costumes are by Elena Zaitseva), off to battle. It looks to be the early 20th century, though the settings convey timeless immediacy. Families and friends mostly sing from the balcony that surrounds the room. But Mr. Abdrazakov’s Igor, looking panicky, paces among the troops, sometimes adjusting their hats. Solid and ruggedly handsome, Mr. Abdrazakov is a confident actor. Though his voice is firm and robust, he is not one of those formidable, gravelly Russian basses. He is a fine singer of Italian repertory, and his Igor has moments of Italianate lyrical refinement. He brings passion, even a touch of neediness, to his exchanges with his devoted wife, Yaroslavna, the Ukrainian soprano Oksana Dyka in her Met debut. She is like a classic Russian soprano, with a cool, penetrating intensity, fearless high notes and a glint of steel in her sound. In this production, the prologue is followed by Borodin’s scene in the Polovtsian steppes, here called Act I. (Some versions place it as Act II.) The defeat of Igor’s troops is something we only learn about after it has happened offstage. Mr. Tcherniakov includes a filmed episode after the prologue showing close-ups of worried soldiers, flashes from explosions and, finally, the twisted corpses of fallen troops. These images overlap with the beginning of the haunting music of the Polovtsian scene, set in a wondrous, almost surreal field of red poppies, a captivating way to depict the lure of the East. The act is presented as if it is all taking place in Igor’s mind, but he encounters very real people. The charismatic Georgian mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili brings her plush big voice and a sultry physicality to the role of Konchakovna, the daughter of the Khan (the muscular Slovakian bass Stefan Kocan). Konchakovna, deep in thought and yearning for Vladimir, sings a great aria wondering when her beloved will come to her. The Russian tenor Sergey Semishkur, in his Met debut, is an earnest, impetuous Vladimir, singing with a slightly nasal and impassioned voice. The trade-off for turning this act into a dreamscape is the confusion Mr. Tcherniakov introduces for people new to “Prince Igor,” which is seldom heard in America. The work was last presented at the Met in 1917, if you don’t include a few performances in 1998 by the visiting Mariinsky Theater in a very traditional, very bland production. When Mr. Abdrazakov sings the captive Igor’s great aria of lament for having brought his army to defeat and his country to shame, at one point he addresses his wife, knowing that she alone would forgive him. In this staging, the wife, Ms. Dyka, appears as if in a vision to Igor. Some people in the audience might become confused over just who is real and who is a phantom in this scene. The best-known music from “Prince Igor” is the popular Polovtsian dances with chorus. To stage the music, Mr. Tcherniakov turns his poppy field into a lush pasture where some three dozen dancers (bare-chested men and women in light spring dresses) cavort to choreography by Itzik Galili. The Met choristers sing from the side boxes closest to the stage. Acoustically the effect is thrilling. By the end of the scene, even Igor seems momentarily enthralled by the sensory splendor all around him. Igor has entrusted his wife and his city to the care of his brother-in-law, Prince Galitsky, a coarse cad, who schemes to take power while Igor is captive. The feisty Russian bass Mikhail Petrenko is a sneering, prickly Galitsky, exhorting his followers into frenzied drunken revels that jibe with the pummeling rhythms of the music. For all its theatricality, this production focuses your attention on Borodin’s beguiling score. Even during anthems, dances and elegies, Borodin tapped into depths of sadness that seem part of the Russian culture and heritage. Mr. Noseda conveys the Russian character of the music, while conducting it with clarity and precision. The Met chorus is at its glorious best. Mr. Tcherniakov and Mr. Noseda take the biggest leap at the end of the opera. The libretto describes Igor as returning to a city in ruins. Here the decimated public meeting room, which has been hit by bombs lobbed by the Polovtsian troops, shows the grim extent of the ruination. The shellshocked Igor is barely recognizable. Mr. Abdrazakov does his most burnished, powerful singing in the prince’s despairing soliloquy in this scene. Then the people hoist Igor, as if oblivious, on their shoulders and sing his praises — the way the opera traditionally ends. But Mr. Abdrazakov’s Igor looks stunned to see his people cheering him. Then, “The River Don Floods,” an orchestral scene that Borodin wrote for another dramatic work, is played. During its turbulent opening episode, Igor stomps among his people looking unhinged.

Other people tried to finish and fix it, but it was a big job. The opera is about a prince named Igor who goes to fight some nomadic people causing trouble. Unfortunately, Igor and his son get captured, but manage to escape and return home to a ruined city where they are hailed as heroes. This new production, led by a man called Dmitri Tcherniakov, changes many parts of the opera, even rearranging scenes and adding new music. Tcherniakov's idea is to make the opera focus on Prince Igor's inner journey, showing his doubt and insecurity. He even uses bits of silent film to help tell the story. Many different singers, including Ildar Abdrazakov as Igor, bring the characters to life with their wonderful voices. In the end, even though some things might be confusing for new viewers, Tcherniakov and his team create a beautiful and emotional production that brings new life to \\"Prince Igor\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The first step to getting red lips is getting rid of dry, flaky skin that builds up and hides their natural color. Sloughing away the dead skin brightens your lips, brings out their inner red color and prepares them to take on a stain. Here's how to make and use your own scrub:  Mix 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon brown sugar. Scrub the mixture into your lips in a circular motion. Rinse the mixture away with warm water. Repeat as necessary. Sometimes a basic lip scrub isn't enough to get rid of the dead skin. Using a soft-bristled toothbrush will do the trick. Choose a clean toothbrush, wet it with warm water, and gently scrub your lips in a circular motion. Rinse your lips. They should be left bright, plump and renewed. Increasing circulation to your lips makes them look plumper and redder. You can naturally make your lips a little plumper by using cinnamon or another spicy household item on your lips. Just rub a little on, wait a few minutes, then rinse your lips. You can use any of the following as a natural lip plumper:  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper mixed with a few drops of water 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon mixed with a few drops of water 5 drops of peppermint essential oil or peppermint extract A piece of fresh ginger rubbed over your lips Now that your lips have been exfoliated and plumped, it's time to make them soft and supple. This will help them keep their color longer and prevent them from drying out. Use any of the following ingredients as a lip serum; just rub it on your lips and wait a few minutes for it to absorb:  1/2 teaspoon coconut oil 1/2 teaspoon olive oil 1/2 teaspoon almond oil","output":"To achieve red lips, follow these steps: 1) Remove dead skin by using a homemade honey and brown sugar scrub, or a soft-bristled toothbrush. 2) Boost circulation and plumpness with natural lip plumpers like cinnamon, cayenne pepper, peppermint, or ginger. 3) Keep lips soft and supple with a lip serum made from coconut oil, olive oil, or almond oil.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- The judge delayed a decision on allowing a new lawyer to join Dr. Conrad Murray's defense team until he can determine if there is a conflict of interest. The lawyer, Nareg Gourjian, had worked on Michael Jackson's child molestation defense. Murray, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson, wants Gourjian to replace Joseph Low, who left the defense team earlier this month. Gourjian's former law firm, headed by lawyer Mark Geragos, raised the possible conflict of interest before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor at a hearing Tuesday. \\"We have a great amount of respect for Mr. Gourjian, but it is our duty to disclose his participation in our past representation for Mr. Jackson,\\" Geragos and Geragos attorney Pat Harris said.

Picking this sentence would show that Gourjian, being newer to law, was less involved in the high-profile Jackson case and more wrapped up in a different case altogether. Therefore, his potential conflict with past representation of Jackson might be lesser than assumed or outright null. Providing this context could also further underline the argument that he is a fit addition to Dr. Murray's defense team.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... According to the above context, answer the following question. What are some side effects of constipation in the elderly? A:","output":"Some side effects of constipation in the elderly include: 1. Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits 2. Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful 3.

Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) 5.

I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: How does the author suggest that one can save money? Options: - by decluttering your home   - not enough information   - by recycling items you already own   - by accepting used items from a friend  or a relative === The correct answer is A:","output":"- by accepting used items from a friend or a relative Justification: The author mentions that \\"kids go through things so fast and it's nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative\\". Hand-me-downs refer to used items that are given from one person to another.

In the cosmetic section of the drugstore you'll find shelves of products designed to have a lip-plumping effect. These glosses and chapsticks usually contain ingredients like cinnamon oil or capsaicin, the substance that makes hot peppers hot.","output":"Used in small concentrations, these ingredients stimulate blood flow to the area where they are applied, causing a temporary swelling effect. They can also produce a subtle tingling sensation, which some people find pleasant, while others might experience a mild discomfort. To achieve pouty lips without undergoing more invasive procedures like lip fillers, follow these helpful guidelines for using lip-plumping products: 1. Choose the right product: Opt for a reputable brand, and remember that everyone's lips may react differently to certain ingredients. To find a product that works best for you, read reviews and consider asking for recommendations from friends or a beauty consultant. 2. Exfoliate your lips: Before applying your chosen lip-plumping product, gently exfoliate the surface of your lips to remove dead skin cells and create a smooth canvas for a more even application. Exfoliation can also boost blood circulation for a fuller, more voluminous look. You can use a store-bought lip scrub or concoct a simple mixture of sugar and honey to rub gently on your lips. 3. Hydrate and Moisturize: Because lip-plumping products containing particular ingredients can be drying, it's crucial to hydrate and moisturize your lips regularly. Use a hydrating lip balm as part of your daily skincare routine to ensure a healthy foundation for your plumping gloss or chapstick. 4. Follow the instructions: Each product will have specific application instructions, so follow them closely. Apply the product using an applicator brush, a lip brush or a fingertip, depending on your preferred method and the product's design. Begin with a thin layer to gauge your comfort level and the desired effect. Allow the product to work for a few minutes, observing any tingling sensation or redness. 5. Adjust application as needed: If you're satisfied with the results, you can reapply lip-plumping product throughout the day. However, if you experience any ongoing discomfort or irritation, discontinue use and consult with a dermatologist. It's possible that you are sensitive to one of the ingredients, so trying a different product with another formulation might yield better results. 6. Enhance with makeup: For an even more dramatic effect, use makeup to create the appearance of fuller lips. Apply a lip liner that matches your natural lip color, outlining just slightly outside your lip line to create the illusion of added volume. Fill in the space with lipstick or gloss, and add a dab of highlighter to the cupid's bow and the center of the lower lip to enhance the plump, pouty look. By following these tips and incorporating lip-plumping products into your beauty routine, you can achieve the appearance of fuller, more voluminous lips while avoiding costly or invasive procedures. Remember to pay close attention to how your lips react to various products to find the perfect match for your desired effect, and enjoy your newfound pout!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before now reports Atari had dumped millions of game cartridges were widely believed to be an urban myth. But a three-hour dig at a landfill site turned up many Atari cartridges, including copies of the game ET: The Extra Terrestrial. Atari made millions of copies of the ET game, but it sold poorly and helped to contribute to the demise of the firm. \\"For a lot of people, it's something that they've wondered about and it's been rumoured and talked about for 30 years, and they just want an answer,\\" said Zak Penn, director of a documentary being made about the search for the site and its uncovering. The documentary, produced by Lightbox, is being prepared for Microsoft's Xbox TV channel. Atari was thought to have dumped truckloads of unsold games in the landfill site on the outskirts of Alamogordo  in 1983 as the company was winding down. The game maker's descent from its position as the dominant force in home gaming in the late 1970s and early 1980s was swift and has been partly blamed on the gamble it took on making a game of Steven Spielberg's 1982 hit film ET. The game was made from scratch in five weeks for the Atari 2600 console. Even before the game was finished Atari, committed huge amounts of money and resources to it and produced millions of copies when it was done. The ET game has been described as one of the worst ever created. Its challenging game play and poor graphics put people off buying it and left Atari with huge amounts of unsold inventory. The search to see if the rumours about the dump were true was given new life by the efforts of one unnamed game enthusiast who did the detective work to narrow down its location. Red tape surrounding the uncovering of the landfill site held up the start of the dig but once permission was granted excavations began on 26 April. Three hours of digging with a backhoe uncovered significant amounts of Atari 2600 game cartridges - many of which were still in their original packaging. Only a limited amount of material could be retrieved from the dump because the dig was only allowed access for one day. The local authority of Alamogordo ordered the dig site to be refilled on 27 April.

On the other hand, if you are hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2 then you probably should stay away. The plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl's friends, girl meets guy's friends, and guy meets girl's parents scenes. There is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene.

Process: - Blood is sent to the liver - The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The blood is cleaned - Energy is produced - The blood leaves the liver cleaned.  Question: suppose you drink more alcohol happens, how will it affect You have better complexion.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"When you consume alcohol, the liver is primarily responsible for breaking it down and removing it from the bloodstream. The effect of drinking more alcohol on your complexion will be influenced by the liver's ability to process the alcohol you consume; this is the perturbation you have mentioned. To respond to the impact of this perturbation on the second effect mentioned, which is improved complexion, I will provide a detailed explanation. Upon drinking alcohol, it is absorbed into the bloodstream, and then the liver metabolizes it to prevent its harmful effects on the body. The liver takes up this responsibility by using specific enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). These enzymes break down alcohol into acetaldehyde, which is then further processed into water and carbon dioxide before being eliminated from the body. Consequently, the liver is a vital organ which plays a significant role in cleansing and detoxifying the body. When you drink more alcohol than the liver can successfully handle, the liver's ability to process the alcohol diminishes. As a result, the blood cannot be cleansed effectively, causing a buildup of harmful substances, inflammation, and oxidative stress. This impacts the liver's proper functioning and its capacity to produce energy. When it comes to the complexion, the liver is crucial in maintaining the health of the skin. A well-functioning liver promotes radiant skin as it can effectively detoxify the body. Conversely, when the liver is struggling to handle the amount of alcohol consumed, skin health may suffer. Since the liver is not able to carry out its detoxification process as efficiently, it can lead to a buildup of toxins affecting the skin's appearance, potentially causing dullness, acne, redness, or sallowness. Therefore, drinking more alcohol can have a negative effect on your complexion, as it imposes stress on the liver, impairing its ability to detoxify the body. This can lead to skin problems that reflect the body's internal imbalances. The supposed perturbation, which is an increased amount of alcohol consumption, influences the second effect mentioned (improved complexion) by having a detrimental effect rather than a positive one. Ultimately, increased alcohol consumption will lead to a less healthy complexion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And I was wondering What does Aubrey need to do before this?","output":"Before Aubrey can offer themselves to the gods as part of the pagan religious ceremony, they should follow several steps to ensure they are well-prepared and respectful of the tradition. Here's a step-by-step guide: Step 1: Researching the Tradition Aubrey should start by researching the specific pagan tradition they are interested in, as there are many different pagan practices. This will help them understand the rituals, beliefs, gods, and ceremonies associated with that tradition. Step 2: Choose the Specific Deities  After gaining knowledge about the particular pagan practice, Aubrey should decide which gods or goddesses they would like to offer themselves to. They should also learn about the deity's characteristics, preferences, and expectations. Step 3: Determine the Purpose of the Offering Aubrey needs to understand and set a clear intention for their offering. The purpose may be to seek the deity's guidance, protection, or blessings in a particular area of their life. Step 4: Cleanse and Purify Before the ceremony, it's essential to cleanse and purify oneself physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Aubrey may choose to take a ritual bath, meditate, or perform a cleansing ritual to prepare themselves for the offering. Step 5: Prepare Sacred Space Aubrey should set up an altar or sacred space dedicated to the chosen deity. This could include symbols, statues, or images representing the deity, as well as offerings such as food, flowers, or incense. Step 6: Invoke the Presence of the Deity During the ceremony, Aubrey should invoke the chosen deity's presence through various means such as prayer, chanting, or singing. They may also choose to cast a circle to establish a protective barrier around the sacred space. Step 7: Perform the Offering Ritual Aubrey should now perform the offering ritual, which may vary depending on the chosen pagan tradition or the deity. This could involve lighting candles, saying a prayer, or making symbolic gestures. Step 8: Give Thanks and Close the Ceremony After the offering ritual, Aubrey should express their gratitude to the deity for their presence and any blessings received. They can then close the circle if one was cast and respectfully pack up the sacred space. By following these steps, Aubrey will be well-prepared to offer themselves to the gods as part of the pagan religious ceremony."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I just started my shift that afternoon, got endorsements from the previous shift, and prepared myself to meet my residents. One of my residents that day was post-op total knee replacement. I went to her room, introduced myself as her CNA, and asked her if she needed anything before I leave her room. And then, she told me she’s having a hard time using the commode the previous nurses gave her when she was admitted to our facilty as it was very small for her given the fact that she also had a recent TKA (total knee arthroplasty). Because of this, I told her I’ll do my best to look for a commode that will fit her. I looked in our two storage areas and fortunately, I found one that was perfect for her! Voila! I disinfected it really well and returned to her room with her new commode. Her face immediately lighted up when she saw what I was carrying and she started tearing up! Startled by her reaction, I asked her what’s wrong and why was she crying. And then she told me she’s been asking the previous shifts for two days and no one’s bringing the right commode for her. They kept on telling they’re going to bring her a new one, but they probably ended up forgetting her request. She was so ecstatic! I helped her try the commode and it really was perfect for her and she didn’t have a hard time using it. She thanked me so much, and oh, it was mother’s day that day! She told me one of the most touching thing, “happy Mother’s day to your Mom and thank your Mom for me. She raised you really well.” I had no idea a simple commode can bring so much joy to my resident. Small things really do matter! When did the patient begin to cry? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Before her knee surgery  B. not enough information  C. Before asking the author for the commode  D. After the author brought her the commode The answer is:","output":"D. After the author brought her the commode. According to the information provided in the passage, the patient began to cry out of happiness and relief when she saw that the caregiver had brought her a new, correctly-sized commode that she could use comfortably following her total knee arthroplasty surgery. This was after she had requests unfulfilled by past nurse's shifts. The text states \\"Her face immediately lighted up when she saw what I was carrying and she started tearing up!\\" which indicates that her tears began after the commode was brought to her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Finding Galina doesn't take long, and Jacques must wrap up the mission by returning Galina and the contraband to his superiors by train. Jacques's physician wife Madeline (Susan Gibney) isn't happy about this turn of events, no doubt having invested a small fortune in a Berlitz correspondence course and a year of acting lessons for Jacques's birthday. But she sees him off at the train station with the couple's teenaged daughter Bailey Kristoff (Jessica Bowman) and son Ethan Kristoff (Kristopher Van Varenberg). It seems Galina's ill-gotten gain is three vials of SP-43, an ultra-virulent strain of smallpox, cultured in fluorescent green serum.

Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \\"pawns\\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \\"I say that is a very cowardly response,\\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \\"to make the laws and change the laws.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: Andrews County Airport, 3rdRunwayLengthFeet, 2939. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The provided data, \\"Andrews County Airport, 3rdRunwayLengthFeet, 2939\\", refers to specific details about a particular airport located in Andrews County. In this case, the focus is on the length of the 3rd runway at the airport, which is 2939 feet long. To better understand this information, let's break down each component and discuss them in more detail, starting with the location, the airport's general features, and finally the importance of runway length. Location: Andrews County The airport mentioned in the data is situated in Andrews County, a region in the state of Texas, United States. This county is located in the western part of the state, and its seat is the city of Andrews. The airport is utilized by the local community for transportation, connecting the area with other regional airports and serving domestic air travel needs. Airport Facilities The Andrews County Airport typically serves general aviation needs, which include private, corporate, and recreational flights. Many smaller airports like this one do not have regularly scheduled commercial flights; however, they often provide important services, such as charter flights, emergency services, flight training, and maintenance. Airports of this size have runways, taxiways, and aprons to accommodate various types of aircraft, including small propeller-driven airplanes and helicopters. Some might also house control towers, fueling stations, hangars, and terminal buildings to support the arrival and departure of passengers and crew members, along with their parking facilities. 3rd Runway Length In this particular data set, the focus lies on the length of the 3rd runway, which stands at 2939 feet. Runway length is essential for pilots and aviation planners to gauge whether the runway is suitable for a specific type of aircraft, as it can directly impact takeoff and landing safety. Factors that determine the required runway length include aircraft type, flight distance, airplane gross weight, air temperature (density altitude), and wind conditions. A 2939-foot-long runway, as in this case, is suitable for small- to medium-sized general aviation aircraft, as well as certain light business jets. These aircraft types can safely operate on shorter runways compared to large commercial jets since their takeoff and landing requirements are lower, allowing for efficient utilization of this specific airport. It's important to note that runway lengths can vary greatly depending on these parameters, so pilots and operators must consider their specific requirements carefully before attempting takeoffs and landings. In conclusion, the data provided outlines essential information about an airport located in Andrews County that serves the local community and its aviation needs. The length of the 3rd runway at 2939 feet offers a suitable ground infrastructure for small- to medium-sized aircraft, contributing to the safe and efficient operation of flights in and out of the Andrews County Airport. It is crucial for airport management, pilots, and aviation authorities to understand these variables for optimal functioning and the safety of all involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

France won Australia's largest-ever defence contract in April beating rival bids from Japan and Germany. The new defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, will oversee the A50bn (â‚¬34bn; Â£29bn) deal. The decision to build the naval fleet in South Australia - Mr Pyne's home state - is expected to create thousands of jobs and boost the local economy. The prime minister said it would completely transform the defence industry in Australia. \\"This is a big change, a big reform, and it requires additional leadership and additional oversight,\\" Mr Turnbull said. \\"This programme is vitally important for the future of Australian industry.\\" The reshuffle otherwise brought in only minor changes, with most key figures staying in their roles. Despite pressure from some right-leaning elements of his party, Mr Turnbull did not offer a cabinet post to Tony Abbott, the man he ousted as prime minister in 2015. Meanwhile another former prime minister, Kevin Rudd, has announced he has asked the government to nominate him for the post of secretary general of the United Nations. Mr Turnbull said cabinet would consider the request, which had been widely expected.

The answer is:","output":"2000"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Cleese was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, the only child of Reginald Francis Cleese (1893-1972), an insurance salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn (nee Cross; 1899-2000). His family's surname was originally Cheese, but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the Army during the First World War. As a child, Cleese supported Bristol City FC and Somerset County Cricket Club. Cleese was educated at St Peter's Preparatory School, where he received a prize for English and did well at cricket and boxing. Cleese achieved greater prominence in the United Kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, which he co-wrote with his wife Connie Booth. The series won three BAFTA awards when produced and in 2000, it topped the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. The series also featured Prunella Scales as Basil's acerbic wife Sybil, Andrew Sachs as the much abused Spanish waiter Manuel (\\"... he's from Barcelona\\"), and Booth as waitress Polly, the series' voice of sanity. Cleese based Basil Fawlty on a real person, Donald Sinclair, whom he had encountered in 1970 while the Monty Python team were staying at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay while filming inserts for their television series. Reportedly, Cleese was inspired by Sinclair's mantra, \\"I could run this hotel just fine if it weren't for the guests.\\" He later described Sinclair as \\"the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met,\\" although Sinclair's widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series. During the Pythons' stay, Sinclair allegedly threw Idle's briefcase out of the hotel \\"in case it contained a bomb,\\" complained about Gilliam's \\"American\\" table manners, and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town.  The first series was screened from 19 September 1975 on BBC 2, initially to poor reviews, but gained momentum when repeated on BBC 1 the following year. Despite this, a second series did not air until 1979, by which time Cleese's marriage to Booth had ended, but they revived their collaboration for the second series. Fawlty Towers consisted of only twelve episodes; Cleese and Booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series.  In December 1977, Cleese appeared as a guest star on The Muppet Show. Cleese was a fan of the show and co-wrote much of the episode. Cleese also made a cameo appearance in their 1981 film The Great Muppet Caper.  Cleese won the TV Times award for Funniest Man on TV - 1978-79.

The reviewer also criticizes the movie's portrayal of certain figures, stating that Moore (the film's creator) could make even well-respected personalities like Roosevelt and WW2 look bad, further demonstrating the distrust and disdain the reviewer holds towards the film's narrative. Another strong indication of the negative tone throughout the review is the accusation of the movie insulting the intelligence of its viewers. By stating that even the \\"most apolitical among us can't help feeling manipulated,\\" the reviewer maintains that the film fails in maintaining the neutrality, balance, and credibility expected in a documentary, reducing it to what the reviewer calls a \\"political hack job.\\" Moreover, the reviewer refers to the film as \\"The world according to Moore,\\" suggesting that the film is a subjective and heavily biased portrayal of reality.

Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? She doesn't believe much of that story. Options: 1). unacceptable; 2). acceptable;","output":"2). acceptable; The sentence \\"She doesn't believe much of that story\\" can be considered correct by a linguist, even when applying the strictest standards. To provide a more detailed analysis of the sentence, let's break it down into its components and examine why the sentence is deemed acceptable. 1. Subject: \\"She\\" — The subject \\"she\\" is a pronoun that functions as the subject of the sentence. \\"She\\" is appropriate for third-person singular reference, which is commonly used in everyday speech and formal writing. The choice of \\"she\\" as the subject presents no linguistic issues. 2. Auxiliary Verb: \\"doesn't\\" — This is a contraction of \\"does not\\" and is used to form the negative of the main verb \\"believe.\\" \\"Doesn't\\" is the correct auxiliary verb for third-person singular negative sentences in the present simple tense. The use of this auxiliary verb is in line with standard English grammar rules. 3. Main Verb: \\"believe\\" — The main verb \\"believe\\" agrees with the subject \\"she\\" and the auxiliary verb \\"doesn't.\\" In the present simple tense, third-person singular subjects typically take the verb form with \\"-s\\" or \\"-es\\" added to the verb's base form (e.g., believes, goes). However, when using the negative form with \\"do not\\" or \\"does not,\\" the base verb form without the \\"-s\\" or \\"-es\\" (e.g., believe, go) is used. So, \\"believe\\" is the correct verb form in this context. 4. Object: \\"much of that story\\" — The phrase \\"much of that story\\" is an appropriate object for the verb \\"believe.\\" The quantifier \\"much\\" indicates a general, nonspecific amount, making the statement less definitive and suggesting that the subject (\\"she\\") accepts some parts of the story but not all of it. This expression is natural and acceptable in English. In summary, the sentence \\"She doesn't believe much of that story\\" can be considered acceptable by a linguist observing the strictest standards of grammar and usage. All components of the sentence are appropriate and comply with the rules of standard English grammar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plot title: Mulan Movie plot: In 450 A.D., the ruling Chinese dynasty is under constant threat from the Rouran tribes. The Chinese army conducts a nationwide draft. A retired soldier named Hua Hu insists on enlisting again to serve his country. Mulan (Zhao Wei), his young daughter, is quite intelligent and skilled in various martial arts. But because she is a woman, she cannot enlist. Mulan tricks her father, steals his armor and weapon, disguises herself as a boy and enters the Wei army in her father's place. She is recognized by her friend Xiaohu, who agrees to keep her secret. Through the harsh military training, Mulan proves to be quite courageous, quick-thinking, and unstoppable, always helping others fend off the army bullies. She gains the attention of Wentai (Chen Kun), the battalion's Sub Commander. They soon befriend and develop a mutual fondness and liking for one another. One night, when Wentai is taking a bath in a hot spring, he accidentally runs into Mulan. After a brief skirmish, Mulan escapes without exposing her identity. However, Wentai becomes determined to uncover the woman hiding among the troops. To make things worse, the army bully loses a jade pendant and a strip-search is ordered. Terrified to reveal herself as a woman and tarnish her father's reputation, Mulan admits that she committed the theft. In prison, she tells Wentai the truth and he promises to keep her secret until the very end. When the Rourans launch a surprise attack, Wentai releases Mulan from jail, but Mulan stays back to fight. Her life is spared and she is also promoted to be a female sub-commander. Eventually both Wentai and Mulan become generals. Wentai and his men are ambushed, and Wentai orders Mulan to stay behind to guard the army's supplies. Afraid for Wentai, Mulan delegates the order to another soldier and follows him.

But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole. First off, Chris Rock. He plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously, this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, it doesn't. Even when he's talking to one other character, he seems to think he's trying to make a roomful of people laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they mostly come during the standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out. Also, the movie was poorly directed. The movie has basically a one-joke plot: old white guy acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this still could have worked, and been quite funny. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy. It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling Chris Rock's jokes, but for most of the time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not nearly as funny. The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like Rock are, in fact, hilarious. If he had been shown more, the movie would have been a lot funnier. Overall, a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that \\"Down To Earth\\" is poorly acted, and poorly directed. This one was a pretty big disappointment. Rating: 4/10 How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with Chris Rock's performance and the movie's direction, stating that it was poorly acted and directed.

The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915.

Article:      The Pacific Northwest continued to struggle Thursday under a parade of storms that have marched in like hostile armies from the Pacific. As Seattle coped with freezing rain and ice -- 300,000 homes were without power at midday -- officials in parts of Oregon were evacuating homes.      The state was battling near-record floods as the snow that hit earlier in the week turned into torrential rain. The onslaught melted the snow, sending cascades of water down rivers and creeks.      With prospects of continued flooding, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber late Thursday declared a state of emergency due to severe winter weather in Marion, Coos, Benton and Lincoln counties.      \\"In a couple of cases, we have had rivers and creeks reach levels of the last big round of floods we had in 1996. So this is serious,\\" Gene Evans, spokesman for Oregon's emergency operations center, told the Los Angeles Times.      Hardest hit were small towns near the state capital of Salem, in the Willamette Valley, which saw up to 3 inches of rain over the last 24 hours, and areas along the coast, where residents got up to 6 inches of rain.      In the town of Albany on Wednesday night, a vehicle with four people inside was swept out of a grocery store parking lot into a nearby creek that had suddenly overflowed. The car appears to have been sucked rapidly into a culvert under the road, where it became trapped, Wanda Omdahl, spokeswoman for the Albany Fire Department, said in an interview.      Rescuers were able to pull out 24-year-old Christopher Wilgus and his 5-year-old son, Maliki, who were transported to the hospital, and they continued to search the watery darkness for the other two people in the car.      \\"After about two hours, the chance of recovering anyone is not there. No one can survive under water that long. So we switched from a rescue to a recovery mode,\\" Omdahl said.      Shortly after midnight, the body of 20-month-old Aiden McLaughlin was pulled from the water several hundred yards downstream; the body of his mother, Catherine McLaughlin, 18, was found at midday Thursday.      The 5-year-old remained in critical condition Thursday.      Albany Fire Department staffers were also working in the nearby town of Scio, where flooding on Thomas Creek prompted the evacuation of three-fourths of the town's 870 residents and stranded several people in their homes. Rescuers in boats were taking them to nearby evacuation centers.      About 80 homes were evacuated in Turner, where Portland's KGW television had video images of the local fire department -- along with parts of the rest of the town -- surrounded by water.      The capital city was experiencing problems as well, as street flooding washed through several basement parking garages and closed roads. \\"It's pretty much runoff at this point,\\" Evans said.      On the other side of Oregon's Coast Range, rescuers were helping evacuate residents in the 900-resident town of Mapleton, where the Siuslaw River was raging.      The rain had slowed down by Thursday afternoon -- but it was only a temporary respite, National Weather Service meteorologist Tiffani Brown warned.      \\"We've got a little bit of a break this evening and tonight between systems. But another system is coming in from the west during Friday,\\" she said. \\"So we will kind of have a repeat of heavy rainfall for a good period of time. And the outlook just seems to be very similar, where we have a system coming from the west that will bring a good amount of rain every 24 to 36 hours, at least through midweek next week.\\"      The flood warning issued by the National Weather Service for Oregon also extended into southwest Washington.      Near Seattle, the precipitation was still coming down as snow and freezing rain, briefly suspending flights at Seattle Tacoma International Airport on Thursday morning and causing dozens of canceled flights.      At least one fatality was blamed on the storm. A 60-year-old man died near Issaquah, Wash., when a tree fell on him as he was backing his all-terrain vehicle out of a lean-to, King County Sheriff's Department spokesman Cindi West said.      \\"He was going to go for a ride, and his wife was going to go with him. He went to back it out, and when he didn't get back, she went out and found that a tree had fallen on him,\\" she said in an interview.      Sheriff's deputies who investigated the incident were briefly held up from returning when a fallen tree blocked the road -- one of dozens of similar incidents across western Washington that left at least 200,000 homes without power.      Puget Sound Energy, the major utility in the region, warned that some homes might not be brought back on the grid until the weekend.      In what she said was \\"purely a precautionary measure,\\" Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire issued an emergency storm proclamation. It was designed, initially, to relieve restrictions on work hours for dairy truck drivers, helping ensure that milk product deliveries could reach their destinations.      The proclamation will also allow the National Guard and other state agencies to step in if needed.      \\"So far, we haven't received any requests for state assistance -- but we know weather conditions are rapidly changing. I want to make sure we have every resource available to ensure our communities are safe,\\" the governor said.      The Washington forecast was for gradually warming temperatures, with the prospect of rainfall melting the accumulated ice and snow within the next few days.

SEATTLE A deadly ice storm swept across the Pacific Northwest on Thursday, adding to the misery of residents struggling with power outages and treacherous roads since an earlier record snowfall.      Washington's governor declared a state of emergency and the storm was blamed for at least two deaths, including that of a 20-month-old boy in Albany, Oregon, who police said was sitting in a car that was swept into a rain-swollen creek.      In Seattle, which normally sees mild temperatures and wet weather but not heavy snow, the storm has resulted in airport and school closures, car crashes, downed trees and lost power to at least 90,000 households. Overall, some 150,000 homes across the state were without power, officials said.      Nicknamed \\"Snowmageddon,\\" the storm first walloped Seattle and other parts of Washington state with snow on Tuesday night. On Thursday, officials mainly expressed concern about icy rain and its potential to down power lines and cause car crashes.      The icy roads led to crashes in many parts of Washington state on Thursday. On Interstate 90 near the town of Cle Elum, about 80 miles inland from Seattle, six semi-trailer trucks were involved in a collision that blocked the state's major thoroughfare through the Cascade Range of mountains, said Kandi Patrick of the Washington State Patrol.      The emergency proclamation by Washington Governor Chris Gregoire allows for the activation of the Washington National Guard if needed but the governor has not asked for the guard to assist, said her spokeswoman, Karina Shagren.      Record-setting daily snowfall of 6.8 inches was measured early Thursday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, shattering the 1954 record of 2.9 inches, said meteorologist Dan DePodwin on Accuweather.com.      One of three Sea-Tac runways remains shuts, said airport spokeswoman Charla Skaggs. The airport was conducting de-icing operations and at one point all runways were shut, she said.      Few passengers were stranded because the airport is not a major hub for flight connections, Skaggs said.      In the greater Seattle area, downed trees blocked lanes on at least three state highways, Washington State Patrol spokeswoman Julie Startup said. She said there were many collisions on the icy roads.      BLOWN TRANSFORMERS      Power outages kept residents in the dark but blown-out transformers put on a spectacular show.      \\"Skies just keep lighting up,\\" Startup said.      Puget Sound Energy warned power outages in some areas may not be restored until Saturday.      Streets also were a mess as frigid temperatures and freezing rain in the Tacoma area, 35 miles south of Seattle, coated roads with ice.      Near Issaquah, a suburb of Seattle, a 60-year-old man was killed when a snow-laden tree fell on him as he drove an all-terrain vehicle, said King County sheriff's spokeswoman Sergeant Cindi West.      In Albany, Oregon, rescuers were still looking for the mother of Aiden McLaughlin, the toddler who was killed when the car he was in was swept from a grocery store parking lot into a creek, the city's police department said in a statement.      The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings and advisories for most of western Oregon, where rivers and streams are swelling, causing pockets of flooding to roads and homes.      Authorities called for voluntary evacuations of the town of Mapleton, Oregon, which has about 1,000 residents, and some nearby areas because expected flooding, said Amber Fossen, spokeswoman for Lane County.

We have the equation: -65*c + 4 = -253*c + 380 2. We want to find the value of c. So, first, let's get all the c's together on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 253*c to both sides: -65*c + 253*c + 4 = -253*c + 253*c + 380 That becomes: 188*c + 4 = 380 3. Now, let's get rid of the 4 on the left side of the equation by subtracting 4 from both sides: 188*c = 380 - 4 So now, we have: 188*c = 376 4. Finally, we need to find the value of c by dividing both sides by 188: c = 376 / 188 c = 2 So, the answer is c = 2!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Kandahar provincial council chief, was killed during a gathering, said Tooryalai Wesa, provincial governor. He did not know a motive. While the governor initially said a friend killed Karzai, his spokesman later clarified that the death was at the hands of a guard. Saidkhan Khakrezwal, a member of the Kandahar provincial council, told CNN he and others were with Ahmed Wali Karzai when a guard named Sardar Mohammad came into the room and asked to talk to him. The guard then \\"takes Wali to another room and shoots him with a pistol that he had in his hand,\\" Khakrezwal said. The shooter was shot dead by other guards. Sardar Mohammad was a trusted man who had worked as a guard for Karzai for eight years, Khakrezwal said. He was also a commander for a police post where there were about 30 policemen. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying that the guard accused of shooting him was working for them. Karzai suffered bullet wounds to his head and chest, said Mohammad Dawood Farhad, the head of Kandahar Hospital. \\"My brother Ahmad Wali Karzai was killed today,\\" said the Afghan president in a previously scheduled news conference with visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy. \\"The Afghanistan people have suffered a lot. Every Afghan family has suffered. I hope one day these sufferings end.\\" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama comdemned Karzai's murder and extended thoughts and prayers to his family. \\"The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the murder of President Karzai's half brother in Kandahar,\\" Carney said. \\"There's been some claims and we will certainly work with the Afghan authorities on that, but right now the moment here is a personal one and we express our condolences.\\" Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan said ISAF will help the Afghan government \\"bring justice\\" to those involved in the killing. \\"President Karzai is working to create a stronger, more secure Afghanistan, and for such a tragic event to happen to someone within his own family is unfathomable,\\" Petraeus said. Ahmed Wali Karzai, who has been dogged by drug dealing and corruption accusations, had been the subject of WikiLeaks cables leaked last year. Without being prompted, he discussed the accusations with a senior U.S. diplomat, according to one of the cables. He said that the claims are part of a campaign to discredit him and offered suggestions on how to stop drug dealing. \\"He is willing to take a polygraph anytime, anywhere to prove his innocence,\\" the cable said. \\"He suggested that the coalition pay mullahs to preach against heroin, which would reduce demand for poppy cultivation.\\" A U.S. official who authored another cable wrote that even though he must be engaged as head of Kandahar's provincial council, \\"he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker.\\" He said Karzai's \\"reputation for shady dealings\\" should be considered when he recommends \\"costly infrastructure projects. The official said dealing with people like Ahmed Wali Karzai represents a major challenge in Afghanistan: Fighting corruption and building support for government when government officials are corrupt themselves. Karzai \\"appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities, and that the coalition views many of his activities as malign, particularly relating to his influence over the police,\\" the author of the first cable said. In addition to discussions of war, drugs and Afghan politics, a comment in one of the cables also addressed his days as a restaurant owner close to Chicago's Wrigley Field, the iconic baseball stadium. \\"His restaurant was a hub for American(s) in the Midwest who had worked or lived in Afghanistan prior to the Soviet invasion,\\" the cable read.
