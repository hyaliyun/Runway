Please answer the following question: The office smelled like money. Brand new carpet, somebody's expensive perfume still hanging in the air. The chairs in the waiting room are leather and the copy machine has a million attachments and there's pictures on the wall that I don't know what they're supposed to be. Made me ashamed of the shirt I was wearing, the cuffs all frayed and some of the buttons don't match. The secretary is a knockout and I figure Dennis has got to be getting in her pants. Red hair and freckles and shiny skin that looks like she just got out of a hot shower. A smile like she really means it. My name was in the book and she showed me right on in. Dennis shook my hand and put me in a chair that was slings and tube steel. The calendar next to his desk had a ski scene on it. Behind him was solid books, law books all in the same binding, also some biographies and political stuff. \\"Too bad you couldn't make the reunion,\\" Dennis said. \\"It was a hoot.\\" \\"I just felt weird about it,\\" I said. I still did. It looked like he wanted me to go on, so I said, \\"I knew there'd be a bunch of y'all there that had really made good, and I guess I...I don't know. Didn't want to have to make excuses.\\" \\"Hard to believe it's been twenty years. You look good. I still wouldn't want to run into you in a dark alley, but you look fit. In shape.\\" \\"I got weights in the garage, I try to work out. When you're my size you can go to hell pretty quick. You look like you're doing pretty good yourself.\\" Charlene is always pointing to people on TV and talking about the way they dress. With Dennis I could see for the first time what she's talking about. The gray suit he had on looked like part of him, like it was alive. When I think about him in grungy sweats back at Thomas Jefferson High School, bent double from trying to run laps, it doesn't seem like the same guy.

Agents Albert \\"Gib\\" Gibson and Faisal assist him in these missions under the command of Spencer Trilby. However, Harry's wife, Helen, and his daughter, Dana, believe he is a boring computer salesman who does a lot of \\"corporate\\" travel. Harry's latest mission in Switzerland reveals the existence of a terrorist group known as the \\"Crimson Jihad\\", led by Salim Abu Aziz. Harry suspects that antiques dealer Juno Skinner has ties to Aziz. After visiting her, Harry is attacked by Aziz and his men, and then loses him in a pursuit, meanwhile missing the birthday party that his wife and daughter have arranged for him. Harry heads to Helen's office the next day to surprise her for lunch, but overhears her talking to a man named Simon. He uses his connections in Omega Sector to learn that Simon is a used car salesman, pretending to be a covert agent to flirt with Helen. Harry and other Omega agents, disguised, kidnap Helen while she is at Simon's trailer and then frighten Simon into staying away from her. Harry, using a voice masking device, interrogates Helen and learns that (due to his constant absence) she is desperately seeking adventure. Harry thus arranges for Helen to participate in a staged spy mission, where she is to seduce a mysterious figure in his hotel room (in actuality, Harry himself, who hopes to surprise Helen) and plant a tracking bug on him. Yet it nearly goes wrong when suddenly, Aziz's men burst in, kidnap the couple, and take them to an island in the Florida Keys. Aziz reveals he possesses small nuclear warheads hidden inside antique statues shipped by Juno, and threatens to detonate them in major U.S. cities unless the U.S. military leaves the Persian Gulf. He then orders the couple to be tortured; Harry (under a truth serum) reveals his double life to Helen, and then they escape to watch as Aziz has the warheads loaded onto vehicles, and prepares one...

Proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters of quotations are capitalized, and punctuation is typical of other Latin European languages. Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages. The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point. When writing a long number, spaces between every three numbers (e.g. between hundreds and thousands) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts, but not in decimal places, like in English. The number 1,234,567.8910 may be written as 1234567,8910 or 1 234 567,8910. Ordinal numbers (1st) use a point as in German (1.).

Take the pets to the front of a grocery store and sit there with a sign to give them away. Here's a detailed plan to accomplish this goal: 1. Preparation: Before heading to the grocery store, gather all the necessary supplies and items needed to ensure the baby pets' comfort and well-being. This includes carriers or crates, blankets, food, water, and toys, as well as any vaccination or health records if available. 2. Transportation: Ensure that the baby pets are safely and securely transported to the grocery store. Place them in their respective carriers or crates and secure them in your vehicle. Make sure there is proper ventilation, and the temperature inside the vehicle is comfortable for the animals. 3. Permission and location: Speak with the grocery store's manager or owner to obtain permission to give away the baby pets in front of their establishment. Find a suitable spot at the entrance or any high foot-traffic area where you can set up a table or a small enclosure without obstructing the path. 4. Signage and advertising: Prepare a clear and attractive sign that indicates you're giving away baby pets for adoption. You may also provide flyers with information about the pets, their breed, age, and temperament. If possible, share pictures and information on social media platforms or online forums to reach a wider audience. 5. Screening potential adopters: As people approach your stand to inquire about the baby pets, take the time to have a conversation with them. Ask about their experience with pets, their living situation, and if they can provide a safe and loving home for the animals. Doing so ensures that the baby pets will be well taken care of and not end up abandoned or neglected. 6. Finalization: Once you find a suitable adopter, provide them with the baby pet's health records, any care instructions, and your contact information in case they need any support or guidance. Hand over the baby pet to the new owner carefully and ensure that they're securely placed in an adequate carrier or enclosure for their journey home. 7. Follow-up: Stay in touch with the adopters to check on how the baby pets are doing in their new homes. Offer assistance, provide guidance, or share useful resources that can help them take care of their new pets. By choosing this option, you're not only finding loving homes for the baby pets but also spreading awareness about adoption and responsible pet ownership. Releasing young pets into the wild is not recommended as they may be ill-equipped to survive on their own, and it could contribute to overpopulation, endangerment of local fauna, and imbalance in the ecosystem.

You are provided with a list called 'A' which contains mixed elements - it has numbers and alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase). 2. Your task is to replace every alphabet in the list with its corresponding position in the English alphabet. For example, replace 'A' with 1 because 'A' is the first letter in the alphabet, 'B' with 2 because 'B' is the second letter, and so on. The same is applicable to lowercase letters, like replacing 'a' with 1 and 'b' with 2. 3. No changes should be made to the numbers in the list. Guidelines: 1. Iterate through each element in the input list 'A'. 2. Check if the element is a letter (either uppercase or lowercase) using a conditional statement. 3. If the element is a letter, find its position in the English alphabet.     a. You can convert the letter to its ASCII value using the 'ord()' function, then subtract the ASCII value of 'A' (for uppercase letters) or 'a' (for lowercase letters) and add 1 to get the alphabet position. 4.

Trust director Cliff Benson says protection would be based on preserving the area as it is at the moment. \\"Obviously the porpoises are undeterred by our local fishermen and recreational boaters,\\" said Mr Benson. \\"But the importance of this areas as a porpoise stronghold should be internationally recognised so that any future developments which might affect their status here would be subject to stringent environmental assessments. \\"Let's make 2013 the year we put them on the map\\". In recent years research by Sea Trust and other conservationists has established that the north Pembrokeshire coast and such inshore islands as Skokholm, Skomer and Ramsay are strongholds. They are not uncommon in Welsh waters, Mr Benson added, but there are few if any similar recorded concentrations in UK waters. \\"It is something we in west Wales should be very proud of,\\" he said.

Summarize this article: Police are \\"deeply concerned\\" by figures that reveal 56 women and girls are thought to have fled to the war-torn country last year. Esaaf Al-Ahmed arrived in Bradford with her family last year. She is one of three Syrian mothers speaking about the reality of life in their home country and the terror that made them flee to the UK. A national survey carried out last year revealed two-thirds of 11 to 25-year-olds were most likely to speak to their mother if they considered travelling to a conflict zone. Last June, three sisters from Bradford - Khadija, Sugra and Zohra Dawood - disappeared from their homes with their nine children. Their brother is understood to be fighting with extremists in Syria. Helen Ball, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said women and girls were \\"unaware of the dangers they face\\". A mother who tried to abduct her two children to live in Syria under the so-called Islamic State was jailed last week for five years and four months. The 34-year-old woman from Bradford was stopped by the Turkish authorities last October. She told the court she wanted to live under strict Sharia law. Mrs Al-Ahmed and her daughters, four-year-old Hala, eight-year-old Rashal and 14-year-old Rasha, were given sanctuary under the government's Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme on medical grounds.

The first option, printing on regular printer paper, would not work as effectively because the ink on the paper will not transfer well onto the wood surface. Printer paper is designed to absorb ink, so the ink would be locked into the paper fibers and would not easily transfer to the wood. The second option, printing on wax paper, is the correct choice for transferring an artistic ink design onto a piece of wood. Wax paper does not absorb ink, so when it is placed ink-side down onto the wood and pressed firmly (with a heavy book or other pressure), the ink can be easily transferred to the wood surface, leaving a clean and clear design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Why does Stowe visit the graveyard? his fellow police officer had once saved Stowe's life The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"Stowe's Salvation\\" Plot: The movie starts with a dramatic action sequence where Jeffery Stowe, a young and naïve police officer, is ambushed and cornered by a notorious criminal gang during a botched sting operation. Just as all hope seems lost, Stowe is rescued by an older, enigmatic officer, Samuel Harris. Step 1: Set-up the characters relationship Harris is shown to have an intimate knowledge of the city's criminal underworld, and he becomes Stowe's mentor, teaching him the ropes and guiding him on various cases. Thanks to Harris, Stowe matures into a competent and respected officer in the force. This validates the importance of Stowe's life-saving event and sets up the emotional bond between the two characters. Step 2: Develop the plot However, tragedy ensues. Samuel Harris is killed during a routine traffic stop by unknown assailants. Shattered, Stowe takes it upon himself to investigate – but is met with resistance from the police force, who claim the attackers were just lowly thief's. Step 3: Introduce the conflict Ignoring orders, Stowe begins to delve into Harris' past. He soon uncovers a twisted trail connecting his mentor with a long dormant criminal syndicate, and shockingly, the same gang that nearly ended his life years ago. Step 4: Build drama In the midst of his investigation, Stowe gets targeted by the same gang, toying with his life and threatening his loved ones. Stowe realizes that Harris might have been not just a cop, but a silent guardian protecting the city, and possibly himself, from this resurfacing menace. Step 5: Confirm Stowe's motivation The reason Stowe visits the graveyard is a symbol of his devotion and respect towards Harris. Every visit serves as a reminder to Stowe about his own life that he owes to Harris and further motivates Stowe to uncover the truth about Harris' death and bring the criminals to justice. Step 6: Climax and resolution In the climax, Stowe manages to unearth the criminal conspiracy, expose Harris' killers, and bring them to justice. Towards the end, Stowe visits Harris's grave once again, but this time with a sense of fulfillment and closure. Now he knows why his mentor went out of his way to save him - so that Stowe can carry on Harris' legacy in protecting their city. Thus, the plot revolves around Stowe's relentless pursuit of truth and justice, honoring his fallen friend and mentor, and understanding why his life was saved in the first place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While they share some similarities, they cannot be considered equivalent. We can examine the differences and similarities in detail to gain a better understanding of each sentence. 1. Original Sentence: \\"A tourist photographing tall buildings.\\" This sentence describes a tourist who is taking photographs of tall buildings. Some key aspects to note include: - The subject is a tourist, which implies that the person is visiting a location and is interested in capturing the sights and experiences. - The action performed by the tourist is photographing, which means they are using a camera (or another device such as a smartphone) to capture images. - The object being photographed is tall buildings, indicating that the focus of the scenario is on capturing the grandeur or architectural features of large structures. 2. Proposed Sentence: \\"An artist is painting a picture of a building.\\" This sentence describes an artist who is painting an image of a building. Some key aspects to note include: - The subject is an artist, which implies that the person is focused on creating a visual representation of their subject through the medium of painting. - The action performed by the artist is painting, which denotes the use of brushes, paints, and a canvas or another surface to create an artistic representation of the subject. - The object being painted is a building, indicating that the focus of the scenario is on creating a visually appealing portrayal of a structure, which may or may not be tall. From this detailed analysis, we can conclude that the sentence \\"An artist is painting a picture of a building.\\" is not a directly true sentence based on the sentence \\"A tourist photographing tall buildings.\\" While there are similarities such as both subjects capturing images of buildings, they are distinct scenarios involving different people, actions, and purposes.

A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu.

Input: Paragraph: Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins include enzymatic changes by covalent addition of cellular regulatory determinants such as ubiquitin (Ub) and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) moieties. These modifications are widely used by eukaryotic cells to control the functional repertoire of proteins. Over the last decade, it became apparent that the repertoire of ubiquitiylation and SUMOylation regulating various biological functions is not restricted to eukaryotic cells, but is also a feature of human virus families, used to extensively exploit complex host-cell networks and homeostasis. Intriguingly, besides binding to host SUMO/Ub control proteins and interfering with the respective enzymatic cascade, many viral proteins mimic key regulatory factors to usurp this host machinery and promote efficient viral outcomes. Advanced detection methods and functional studies of ubiquitiylation and SUMOylation during virus-host interplay have revealed that human viruses have evolved a large arsenal of strategies to exploit these specific PTM processes. In this review, we highlight the known viral analogs orchestrating ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation events to subvert and utilize basic enzymatic pathways. Ubiquitinylation is an enzymatic cascade involving the covalent linkage of a small protein called ubiquitin to the amino group of a lysine residue in a substrate protein through an isopeptide bond to the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin [5, 6] .

A:","output":"A: The Mekong River is the natural feature that forms most of the border between Laos and Thailand. The Mekong River is one of the most significant rivers in Southeast Asia. It is approximately 4,350 kilometers (2,703 miles) long and stretches from the Tibetan Plateau through China's Yunnan Province, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, where it discharges into the South China Sea.  This mighty river serves as a vital water source, providing essential irrigation for agriculture, facilitating transportation and trade, and sustaining aquatic biodiversity. The Mekong River creates a natural boundary between different nations in the region, making it a historically significant geopolitical feature. As the Mekong River flows along the border of Laos and Thailand, it also influences their cultures, traditions, and cuisines. Fish and other aquatic animals from the river are an integral part of the diet for people living along its banks. Additionally, the Mekong is a primary mode of transportation, connecting remote communities with urban centers. The riverine landscape is also essential to the local ecosystems, which provide habitats for numerous flora and fauna species, many of which are unique to the region. Moreover, the Mekong River has a significant spiritual and historical importance to these countries, shaping their way of life for thousands of years. As the river flows along the Laos-Thailand border, it passes through forest-covered mountains, limestone cliffs, waterfalls, small islands, and fertile plains. Numerous cultural and historical sites can be found on both sides of the Mekong River, showcasing the rich cultural heritage of Laos and Thailand. The Mekong River has played a vital role in the development of trade and communications between the two nations for many centuries. During times of conflict and peace, the river functioned as a crucial link between the two countries and their neighbors. Today, the Mekong Cooperation Organization focuses on fostering strong relationships and collaboration among the countries sharing the river's resources, including Laos and Thailand. In conclusion, the Mekong River is the natural feature that forms most of the border between Laos and Thailand. It is a significant and essential source of water, nutrients, and livelihood for millions of people living in the region. The river not only acts as a geographic boundary but also plays a crucial role in shaping the cultural, historical, and ecological landscape of both countries."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To evaluate the linguistic integrity of the given sentence, I will analyze it based on grammar, syntax, and comprehensibility. Sentence: \\"That John passed surprised her.\\" Step 1: Analyze the grammar The sentence is grammatically correct. \\"That John passed\\" serves as the subject, with \\"surprised\\" being the verb, and \\"her\\" as the object. The sentence also uses the correct tense for the verb. Step 2: Analyze the syntax The syntax of the sentence is less common, but still acceptable. The use of a noun clause (\\"That John passed\\") as the subject, can be somewhat unusual in everyday conversation, but it is grammatically correct and can be found in more complex or formal writing. The sentence structure follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) format, which is typical in English. Step 3: Analyze the comprehensibility While not an everyday expression, the sentence is still relatively easy to understand, especially when seen in context. The meaning is clear: she was surprised by John passing (e.g., an exam, a competition, etc.). Conclusion: The linguistic integrity of the sentence is sound. Although the syntax may be less familiar than simpler constructions, the sentence is grammatically correct, adheres to an SVO pattern, and is comprehensible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mets push Yankees out of New York spotlight The team that has won 27 World Series titles, and the franchise often billed as the most storied in sports, is impossible to forget. Yet even their glorious past cannot rescue the Bombers from exile into unfamiliar territory. The Mets now control the media landscape the Yankees have owned for many moons. Commanding the spotlight is extremely beneficial to the bottom line, especially when it comes to selling tickets and producing TV ratings. And that’s what this game is really about. There’s more to this than momentum gained by a trip (albeit a losing one) to the World Series. The road that went through Los Angeles and Chicago before being blocked by Kansas City produced clearer visions of a bright future. FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \\"LIKE\\" US HERE The Mets move on with a young pitching staff already perceived as star studded. In terms of high-watt glitter, there is no one currently on the Yankees roster who can match up with the Mets’ young guns — unless we all stipulate Alex Rodriguez is still considered to be a stand-alone attraction. With their reputations enhanced nationally by the postseason, Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and, to a lesser extent, Steven Matz, are now worth-the-price-of-admission performers. And depending on how he delivers upon his return, Zack Wheeler could join their ranks. Considering their recent history under Hal Steinbrenner’s more conservative leadership, where building from within is the priority, it’s unlikely Brian Cashman will go out and sign a big-ticket, larger-than-life star who could juice ticket sales and TV ratings, which would have been George Steinbrenner’s reaction if he even got a whiff that the Yankees were losing to the Mets in the back page department. The Boss placed a premium on the showmanship end of the business. Like with most strategies, either approach produces mixed results. Ironically, it was Sandy Alderson, never known as a budget buster, who was rewarded with double dividends when the Mets acquired Yoenis Cespedes. Not only did Cespedes’ bat carry the Mets to the playoffs, he carried SportsNet New York as well. Following the Cespedes trade in late July, Mets telecasts on SNY averaged a 3.21 household rating (304,706 total viewers). During the entire 2015 season, the Mets averaged a 2.63 household rating on SNY (242,434 viewers). Cespedes, with an assist from his much-maligned Rally Canary, was one of the biggest story lines the Mets had to offer. And while questions about his future with the team will be a huge log on the Hot Stove, the Mets will be blessed with other tales moving through the winter, spring training and into the regular season. As they wait to see Alderson’s winter strategy evolve, the Valley of the Stupid, and other media precincts, will be full of argument and debate, especially from the Misery Wing of Mets fans (some disguised as radio talkies), which lives to expect the worst. When that all plays out there still will always be Harvey. Count on this man to continue being the Mets’ ongoing soap opera. He can’t help himself. And it doesn’t get any better than Collins, who is often fueled by his own emotions, as his costar. Trust us, as long as Harvey is a Met, there will be issues that astound and entertain. The Yankees once could claim to have compelling theater, a combination of on-field excellence and enough dysfunction to keep things interesting. The Mets are not just aspiring to those heights, they’ve reached them. This is good for business, too. If a team can win while taking on reality show qualities — especially in this “era of social media” — it broadens the fan base, giving people another reason to watch. The Mets are well on their way to doing just that. While their average season rating on SNY did not surpass the Bombers’ average on YES (2.76, 259,223 total viewers), it was the Mets’ most watched season since 2010. The Mets are positioned to surpass those numbers in 2016. Along with a high-beam spotlight comes the ability to capture the floaters, aka front-running fans. They are not vocal (no first-time-callers/ longtime morons among them) but their ranks are large. Their only loyalty is to winning. And they have been following the Yankees, whether it be purchasing tickets or tuning in to YES. Now this fickle core sees what the Metropolitans have done and they, too, want to invest in the Mets future. Of course the Bombers will survive. And there’s every chance that, once the season starts, they will thrive. Still, it’s got to feel strange in the Bronx. For the New York Yankees, the brand with all that history and tradition, are now officially flying under the radar. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The New York Mets' recent success has pushed the New York Yankees out of the spotlight in the city. The Mets' young and talented pitching staff, as well as the drama surrounding some of their stars, has captured the attention of fans and media alike.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who owned a fleet of ships in the story?\\" is \\"Emperor Chu Ti\\"?","output":"Yes, according to the paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who owned a fleet of ships in the story?\\" is \\"Emperor Chu Ti\\".

It is a bitter pill to swallow, especially for those who eagerly anticipated its release. From the onset, the poorly written screenplay was a significant letdown. It lacked clarity and consistency, causing the narrative to be muddled and tedious. The once-intriguing plot quickly devolved into a sequence of disjointed scenes that were neither engaging nor compelling. In fact, it seemed as though the story was pieced together haphazardly, without any real thought to the overall coherence or structure. Furthermore, \\"A Taste of Disarray\\" suffered from weak character development. The audience was never given the chance to empathize with or truly understand the characters' motivations. This lack of depth, combined with the blunt and unnatural dialogue, left the characters in an awkward, two-dimensional purgatory. The on-screen chemistry between the cast members was virtually non-existent, and as a result, the audience felt detached from their plight. Another significant disappointment was the film's inability to build tension or evoke any kind of emotional response from viewers. Both the movie's pacing and its reliance on clichéd, predictable plot twists robbed it of any sense of urgency or suspense. Additionally, the film's resolution was overly simplistic and contrived, leaving viewers unsatisfied by the complete lack of depth or impact. Moreover, the film's technical aspects failed to impress.

Question: What will happen to Robin?  Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: be forgiven by Quinn  B: wear the glasses  C: Quin will be angry Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it seems that the most suitable answer would be A: be forgiven by Quinn.  There are several reasons behind this choice. Firstly, when Robin accidentally broke Quinn's glasses, they quickly apologized, showing a sense of responsibility for their actions. Apologizing immediately after the incident indicates that Robin acknowledges their mistake and genuinely feels sorry for causing damage to Quinn's glasses. Furthermore, Robin also offered to replace the damaged glasses. By doing so, they demonstrate a willingness to make amends and resolve the situation. This offer to replace the glasses highlights Robin's understanding of the inconvenience they have caused and their intention to correct it. Based on these reasons, it is more likely that Quinn will forgive Robin for their actions.

From Paris With Love (2010)      A conservative estimate of the escalating body count in Pierre Morel’s gleefully chaotic action-adventure comedy “From Paris With Love” is two dozen a day, boasts John Travolta ’s trigger-happy character, Special Agent Charlie Wax. But as you watch Mr. Travolta, twirling a weapon in each hand, dispatch the members of a Chinese drug gang in a Paris restaurant and later in a nearby apartment, it could be a hundred or a thousand. In a rare moment of contemplation, Wax remarks that there are a billion more to be disposed of.      This gonzo wild man storms into the movie at a Paris airport, where security refuses to let him enter the country with his precious energy drinks whose containers hide firearms. But with the last-minute intervention of his new partner, James Reese (a mustachioed Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a personal aide to the American ambassador in France, Wax is allowed in.      Winking broadly, “From Paris With Love” leads us back into vintage James Bond territory where fiendish Asian baddies were casually exterminated like so many cockroaches. What’s another billion anyway? In this movie, whose title echoes that of the second Bond film in that endless franchise, the drug dealers are somehow related to the Pakistani terrorists on whom “From Paris With Love,” all but forgetting about drugs, directs its searchlights in its second half. The turning point comes with the smashing of a cocaine-filled vase that Reese has been dutifully toting from place to place.      “From Paris With Love,” Mr. Morel’s follow-up to his B-movie blockbuster, “Taken,” is a really a one-sided buddy movie in which a leather-clad Mr. Travolta, with a shaved head and an earring, camps it up in the Vin Diesel supermacho style. Details in the screenplay by Adi Hasak, based on a Luc Besson story, signal that beneath his facade Wax is really a softie. He goes moony when a recording of “(They Long to Be) Close to You” comes on a car radio, then demands his companions not tell anyone of his weakness. Late in the movie he is also revealed as a killer at the chessboard, as is Reese.      Mr. Travolta so completely dominates the movie that Mr. Rhys Meyers can barely crawl out from under his shadow once Wax appears. Mr. Rhys Meyers’s better moments all occur in early scenes before Mr. Travolta blasts onto the screen. Reese has a seemingly perfect girlfriend, Caroline (Kasia Smutniak), and is the apple-polishing golden boy of his boss, Ambassador Bennington (Richard Durden). A low-level operative for the C.I.A., Reese has cloak-and-dagger dreams that are finally rewarded when he is teamed with the appalling Wax.      I am ashamed to admit that this empty-headed, preposterous, possibly evil mélange of gunplay and high-speed car chases on Parisian boulevards is a feel-good movie that produces a buzz. Even more than “Taken,” a kidnapping drama with the semblance of a heart, “From Paris With Love” wallows in action for action’s sake.      The set pieces are precisely calibrated movements in a symphony of violence with no adagio. There is the scene in which Reese watches spellbound on a circular staircase as bodies plummet past him. During a breathless highway chase Wax hangs out of the car window with a rocket launcher aimed at the green Volvo driven by a terrorist, and you can hardly wait for the detonation.      The soundtrack, in which David Buckley’s beat-driven orchestral score seamlessly mingles with the sounds of gunfire, suggests a hip-hop suite precisely coordinated with Michel Abramowicz’s jiggling, agitated cinematography. In these scenes you lean back, let the action wash over you and feel the caffeinated glow as it seeps into bones. For better or worse, “From Paris With Love” is an effective stimulant.      “From Paris With Love” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence and profanity.      FROM PARIS WITH LOVE      Opens on Friday nationwide.

Art films can be more about how they look and feel than whether they tell a coherent or engaging story. Musicals can be all about song and dance. And action films can be gauged by how well they mix the adrenaline and testosterone cocktail that movie-goers are expected to imbibe. Such is the case with From Paris with Love, a production that views exposition as a necessary evil and dispenses it as quickly as possible so it can get back to shooting people and blowing things up. The movie is intellectually flat but viscerally involving and keeps the pace at such a consistently high level that it can become exhausting. With its wink-and-a-nod approach, it recalls some of the campier action epics of the 1980s, when icons like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis strode across the cinematic landscape sowing death and destruction. Everything's fast and furious, the good guys rarely miss, and the bad guys rarely hit.      From Paris with Love comes out of Luc Besson's factory. Besson is the French filmmaker who makes American action films with more verve than Americans. His movies are usually in English and often feature recognizable Hollywood names. In this case, the A-lister is John Travolta who, as a kick-ass hero, is a little out of his comfort zone, but appears to be enjoying it. With a shaved pate, he looks a little like Mr. Clean and acts like a melding of James Bond, Martin Riggs, and Rambo. The screenplay also remembers Travolta's role in Pulp Fiction and plays homage to it with an in-joke that Tarantino buffs will immediately recognize. (Hint: guess the character's favorite food in Paris.)      This is a mismatched buddy film and follows most of the conventions of the genre. It is told from the perspective of the intellectual newbie, James Reece (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who is the assistant to the American ambassador in Paris. He's in training to be a secret agent, but his assignments are bland, allowing him to spend his days playing chess with the ambassador and his evenings snuggling with his attractive fiancé, Caroline (Kasia Smutniak). Enter superspy Charlie Wax (Travolta). James is assigned to the profane, violent killing machine as his driver/partner and, before they have known each other for an hour, the body count has started to mount. At first, it appears that Charlie is in France to take out a bunch of drug dealers who caused the death of the Secretary of Defense's daughter. But that's a smokescreen. His real purpose is to eliminate a terrorist cell before the members can go active and move against American interests in France.      The story is far from airtight but it's good enough to get the viewer from Point A to Point B, which is all that's necessary in what would have been a B-grade action flick had it not been for Travolta's participation. In terms of its attitude and pace, I'd compare this to The Transporter (also from Besson) and Crank. Neither film took anything seriously and both were propelled by hard-hitting, no-holds-barred action. That's pretty much what's happening here. There is something that passes for a plot twist and, while I won't reveal it here, anyone who doesn't see it coming isn't paying attention.      Travolta chews the scenery with gusto, seemingly delighted to have a chance to attack this sort of role. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is buttoned-down, although most of what Rhys-Meyers does, at least until the end, is react (and carry around a vase full of high quality white powder). There's a priceless scene in a spiral staircase in which his job as rear guard forces him to dodge the bodies Travolta tosses from above - it's funny in a macabre sort of way. The chemistry between the two has a little of the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover Lethal Weapon vibe, but it isn't as well-developed. Surprisingly, considering the limited screen time accorded to it, the romance between Rhys-Meyers and Kasia Smutniak is effective. After only a couple of scenes, I accepted these two as lovers. Smutniak, a Polish-born actress, is making her first high-profile film for American audiences.      There's not much more to say about From Paris with Love. Director Pierre Morel generally does a good job with the action sequences, although his \\"style\\" borrows heavily from The Matrix and its derivatives and he occasionally becomes too enamored with shaking the camera. This is Morel's follow-up to Taken and, unlike the Liam Neeson thriller, it makes no attempt to capture any kind of realism. It's pure comic book/popcorn action. If that's your kind of movie, it's hard to go wrong with this one.

The story follows a personal aide to the American ambassador in France, who pairs up with a trigger-happy special agent to fight against drug dealers and Pakistani terrorists.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Math problem: Solve -363*x - 476*x - 25086 = -161*x for x. What is the solution?","output":"To solve the given equation -363*x - 476*x - 25086 = -161*x for x, we will follow the steps below: 1. Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 2. Move the x term to one side of the equation. 3. Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x to find its value. Here is the step-by-step solution: Step 1: Combine like terms. The like terms on the left side of the equation are -363*x and -476*x. Add these two terms together: -363*x - 476*x = -839*x Now the equation becomes: -839*x - 25086 = -161*x Step 2: Move the x term to one side of the equation. We want to get rid of the -161*x term on the right side of the equation. To do this, add 161*x to both sides: -839*x + 161*x - 25086 = -161*x + 161*x This simplifies to: -678*x - 25086 = 0 Now let's isolate the x term by adding 25086 to both sides of the equation: -678*x - 25086 + 25086 = 0 + 25086 This simplifies to: -678*x = 25086 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x. Now we want to find the value of x by dividing both sides of the equation by -678: -678*x / -678 = 25086 / -678 This simplifies to: x = -37 So, the solution to the equation -363*x - 476*x - 25086 = -161*x is x = -37."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by Elvira's wit and charm. The viewer gets an opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she has travelled from Los Angeles in order to attend the reading of her Great Aunt Morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help the long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal Chastity Pariah and the rest of the town council. She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (Patty) who has her eye on Bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as Elvira. And, later in the movie, she also faces the complications of being descended from ''a major metaphysical celebrity'' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meanings. This movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. In the end Elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman.

It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below.

If you think you need a prescription for ovidrel, make sure you discuss this with a fertility specialist first. They may need to run some tests to confirm that this is a necessary next step for your path to conception.  1). They'll also offer you advice on how to apply ovidrel directly. About 60% of women start using ovidrel a day after birth. 2). Expect reputable testing companies to run low-cost testing to prevent accidental overuse. Pay attention to any potential potential risks factors for having stds, including having irregular periods or vaginal bleeding. 3). When you give the product to your child, discuss any questions you have about possible side effects for your newborn. These questions may influence you whether or not ovidrel will treat cancerous cells on your baby. 4). With the supervision of your fertility specialist and a proper prescription, you can begin your ovidrel treatments. Get training from your doctor about how to perform the injection.

Ovidrel is used during fertility treatments and is typically injected prior to ovulation. 2). This option is unrelated to the use of ovidrel, as it doesn't provide information about injections or discussing it with a fertility specialist.

The teacher, Mrs. Smith, who was very kind and patient, handed out small clocks, shaped like cute little animals, so we could see how much time was left. These were no ordinary clocks.

Information:  - The Washington Naval Treaty, also known as the Five-Power Treaty, and including the \\"Four-Power Treaty\\" and the \\"Nine-power Treaty\\" was a treaty among the major nations that had won World War I, which agreed to prevent an arms race by limiting naval construction. It was negotiated at the Washington Naval Conference, held in Washington, D.C., from November 1921 to February 1922, and it was signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy. It limited the construction of battleships, battlecruisers and aircraft carriers by the signatories. The numbers of other categories of warships, including cruisers, destroyers and submarines, were not limited by the treaty, but those ships were limited to 10,000 tons displacement.  - Justice was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Liberté class built by the French Navy . She had three sister ships : Liberté , Vérité , and Démocratie . Justice was laid down in April 1903 , launched in October 1904 , and completed in February 1908 , over a year after the revolutionary British battleship HMS Dreadnought made ships like Justice obsolete . She was armed with a main battery of four 305 mm ( 12.0 in ) guns , compared to the ten guns of the same caliber mounted on Dreadnought . After her commissioning , Justice was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet . In September 1909 , she traveled to the United States for the Hudson - Fulton Celebration . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet . She covered troop convoys from North Africa to France in the first days of the war , and spent the rest based at Corfu and Mudros without seeing any action . After the war ended , she participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War , though a mutiny in the French fleet in April 1919 led to the fleet 's withdrawal . Justice was sold for scrapping in 1922 .  - The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \\"first colonial empire\\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \\"second colonial empire\\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars in Vietnam (1955) and Algeria (1962), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The French Navy (\\"national navy\\"), informally , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces. Tracing its roots back to 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Since the early foundings, its roles have been defined as maintaining intelligence, protecting populations, preventing crises, intervening wherever necessary to reestablish peace, and dissuading any threats against vital French interests. The Marine nationale consists of four branches: the \\"Force d'Action Navale\\", the \\"Forces Sous-marines\\", the \\"Aéronavale\\" and the \\"Fusiliers Marins\\" (including Commandos Marine). As a blue-water navy the Marine nationale operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships. The French Navy does not use prefixes of the names of its ships (such as the Royal Navy uses HMS, for instance). Foreign commentators sometimes use the prefixes \\"FS\\" (for \\"French Ship\\") or FNS (for \\"French Navy Ship\\"); these are not official, however.  - The San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site includes the location of the Battle of San Jacinto, and the USS \\"Texas\\". It is located off the Houston Ship Channel in unincorporated Harris County, Texas near the city of Houston. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's , made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as \\"dreadnoughts\\", and earlier battleships became known as \\"pre-dreadnoughts\\". \\"Dreadnought\\"s design had two revolutionary features: an \\"all-big-gun\\" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships was a crucial catalyst in the intensifying naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. With the launch of a single ship, \\"Dreadnought\\", the scales of naval power were reset overnight. As a result, dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, during the lead up to World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships had outclassed \\"Dreadnought\\". These more powerful vessels were known as \\"super-dreadnoughts.\\" Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued to be used throughout World War II. The only surviving dreadnought is , located near the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site.

Why was Osho banned? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Task: Answer the three questions provided by the user, one by one, and justify the steps taken to answer them. 1. Do people have sex in Osho's ashram? Step 1: Understand the context Osho, also known as Rajneesh, was a spiritual teacher and the founder of the Rajneesh movement. He established an ashram in Pune, India, which attracted followers from around the world. The ashram was a place for spiritual growth, meditation, and self-exploration. Step 2: Research on Osho's teachings and practices related to sexuality Osho's teachings emphasized the importance of sexual energy as a path to spiritual growth and self-awareness. He believed in embracing sexuality without guilt or restraints, which led to a more open attitude towards sexual relations among his followers. Step 3: Answer the question Based on Osho's teachings and the nature of his ashram, it is reasonable to assume that some of his followers might have engaged in sexual activities in the ashram. However, it is essential to note that the primary purpose of the ashram was spiritual growth and self-discovery. 2. Why was Osho banned? Step 1: Understand the context This question refers to Osho being banned from entering certain countries or facing legal issues and controversies. Step 2: Research the incidents and reasons behind Osho's ban Osho was deported from the United States in 1985 after pleading guilty to immigration fraud. He was also banned from entering several countries, such as the United Kingdom, due to concerns about his controversial teachings and practices. Step 3: Answer the question Osho was banned from certain countries primarily due to legal issues, controversies surrounding his teachings, and concerns about the activities within his movement. His message was seen as radical, and governments were often uneasy about the potential social and political impact of his teachings. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? To determine if two questions are paraphrases, one needs to analyze whether the rephrased question conveys the same meaning or inquiry as the original question. The first question revolves around sexual activities taking place in Osho's ashram, while the second question deals with the reasons for Osho being banned in some countries. On a close examination, it is evident that these questions do not convey the same meaning or inquiry, thus they are not paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Information:  - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world.  - Poltava (Ukrainian, Russian: ) is a city located on the Vorskla River in central Ukraine. It is the capital city of the Poltava Oblast (province) and of the surrounding Poltava Raion (district) of the oblast. Poltava's estimated population is 294,962 .  - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.  - Poltava Oblast (translit. \\"Poltavska oblast\\"; also referred to as Poltavshchyna  \\"\\") is an oblast (province) of central Ukraine. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Poltava.  - Dykanka is the urban settlement in Dykanskyi Raion (district), Poltava Oblast (province) of central Ukraine. Its population is .   - An oblast is a type of administrative division of Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and the now-defunct Soviet Union and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

On March 11, 1990, Lithuania was the first to declare its independence, with Estonia and Latvia following suit in August 1991. All three Baltic states claimed continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1944 and were admitted to the United Nations on 17 September 1991. The remaining 12 republics all subsequently seceded. 12 of the 15 states, excluding the Baltic states, initially formed the CIS and most joined CSTO, while the Baltic states focused on European Union and NATO membership.

Article: Aggie Bonfire   was a long-standing tradition at Texas A&M University as part of the college rivalry   with the University of Texas at Austin. For 90 years, Texas A&M students--known as Aggies--built and burned a bonfire on campus each autumn. Known to the Aggie community simply as \\"Bonfire\\", the annual autumn event symbolized Aggie students' \\"burning desires\\". The bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in connection with festivities surrounding the annual college football game. Although early Bonfires were little more than piles of trash, as time passed, the annual event became more organized. Over the years the bonfire grew bigger, setting the world record in 1969. Bonfire remained a university tradition for decades until, in 1999, a collapse during construction killed twelve people--eleven students and one former student--and injured twenty-seven others. The accident led Texas A&M to declare a pause on an official Bonfire. However, in 2002, a student-sponsored-and-off-campus \\"Student Bonfire\\" came up. In 2003, the event became known as Student Bonfire. In a design approved by a professional engineer, Student Bonfire uses a wedding cake design, but, in a departure from tradition, every log in the stack   touches the ground. For added support, four 24 feet poles are spaced evenly around the stack and then bolted to the 45 feet center pole with a steel pipe. Since the group does not receive funding, Student Bonfire charges a fee to each attendee to cover expenses. Attendance for Student Bonfire ranges from 8,000-15,000 people and the event is held in Brazos County or one of the surrounding counties. Question: When did Aggie Bonfire come into being?

It is the southernmost district of Transnistria, located mostly south of Tiraspol. Its seat is the city of Slobozia, located at , on the river Dniester. The district contains 4 cities/towns and 12 communes (a total of 24 localities, including small villages/hamlets):  - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.  - Tîrnauca (Romanian \\"Ternivka\\", , \\"Ternovka\\") is a commune and village in the Slobozia District of Transnistria, Moldova, situated on the east bank of the river Dniester, between Tighina and Tiraspol. It is notable for being home to the largest bottle-shaped building in the world, the Butylka hotel and museum.  - A is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of extremely small \\"rooms\\" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels.  - Tiraspol (Russian and ) is internationally recognised as the second largest city in Moldova, but is effectively the capital and administrative centre of the unrecognised Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria). The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production.  - Butylka ( Russian for bottle ) is the name of a museum and hotel , sometimes also called the Spirit Museum Hotel . It is located in the village Tîrnauca ( Ternovka ) , 10 km from Tiraspol , the capital of Transnistria . The museum is notable for being housed inside a five - story structure shaped like a giant bottle . It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest building in the world in the shape of a bottle . The museum features owner Grigory Korzun 's vast collection of liquor .  - The Dniester River, or Dnister River ( translit. \\"Dnister\\", , ) is a river in Eastern Europe.

Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.  - A bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth.

It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world.  - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.

More than 100 members of  the family of the executed uncle of Kim Jong-Un have been killed or arrested, a report claims. A news website for North Korean defectors, Daily NK, reported that members of Jang Song-Thaek's family were rounded up by the dozen following his arrest and subsequent death in December. Jang Song-Thaek's children, brothers and grandchildren have been condemned to death, according to media reports in South Korea. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Executed: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, right, is said to have ordered that all relatives of his uncle Jang Song-Thaek, left, were put to death following his order to execute his uncle last month. Although South Korean news agencies have. published unconfirmed information from North Korea in the past, the. report from Daily NK back up the claims of a 'purge' of Jang's family. Jang, 67, was executed last month, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime. The president of South Korea, Park Geun-Hye, has previously spoken of her fear of purges among the powerful in the North. 'North Korea is now engaged in a reign of terror while carrying out a massive purge to consolidate the power of Kim Jong-Un,' she told a cabinet meeting. Sources told the Yonhap News Agency. it is unclear exactly when the family members were killed, but they are. believed to have been put to death after Jang's execution on December. 12. Since Kim Jong-Un came to power in April 2012 he has shown himself to be a brutal tyrant, having executed or demoted a long list of people he has deemed a threat. According to newspaper Chosun Ilbo, Ri Yong-ho, Kim Yong-chun, U Tong-chuk, and Kim Jong-gak, all part of his father Kim Jong-il's inner circle, were handpicked to groom the 31-year-old leader, but have since disappeared or been demoted. As well as his uncle, Jang Song-Thaek, other high-ranking members of the military have been purged, including three defence ministers and three chiefs of the army's general staff. Kim Chol, the vice minister of the army, was reportedly put to death in October 2012 by soldiers firing mortar rounds at him. In August last year, members of a female musical group, Unhasu Orchestra — which included his ex-girlfriend — were reportedly publicly machine-gunned apparently for watching pornography and filming themselves naked. There are said to have been between 40 to 80 public mass executions in North Korea in 2013. 'Some relatives were. shot to death by pistol in front of other people if they resisted while. being dragged out of their apartment homes,' a source told Yonhap. Among. those allegedly executed were Jang's sister Jang Kye-Sun, her husband. and Ambassador to Cuba Jon Yong-Jin and Jang's nephew and Ambassador to. Malaysia Jang Yong-Chol, as well as his two sons. The children and grandchildren of Jang's two brothers are also said to have been killed. One source told the news agency, which is publicly funded and has close links to the South Korean government: 'All relatives of Jang have been put to death, including even children.' Another source said: 'The executions of Jang's relatives mean that no traces of him should be left. 'The purge of the Jang Song-thaek people is under way on an extensive scale from relatives and low-level officials.' The family were recalled to the Pyongyang area of the country by Ministry of State Security troops in early December before being killed, sources said. It has been reported some relatives were shot to death in front of other people if they resisted as they were dragged from their homes. Some relatives by marriage, including the wife of the Malaysian ambassador, are said to have been spared from execution, and instead have been sent to remote villages with their families, sources have said. Plot: Kim Jong-Un, left, gave orders for his uncle Jang, right, to be executed after he was alleged to have plotted to overthrow the communist regime. South Korean media have reported Jang's children, brothers and grandchildren have now been condemned to death by the North Korean leader. Yonhap's report has yet to be corroborated but in North Korea a culture of 'guilt by association' has prevailed for years with family members of those convicted of crimes facing severe punishment, even death, for decades. Kim Jong-Un's former mentor Jang was accused of a number of crimes against the state. They included plotting a coup, misappropriating resources, womanising, abusing his position of power and 'dreaming different dreams' to the regime. North Korea stunned the world by announcing the execution of the man once seen as the dictator's political regent. His death marks the biggest political upheaval since the 30-year-old inherited power. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated country for more than six decades. Jang is the husband of Jong-un's biological aunt, the sister of his father Kim Jong-Il. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article is about how Kim Jong-Un, the leader of North Korea, ordered the arrest and execution of more than 100 members of his uncle Jang Song-Thaek's family. Jang Song-Thaek was executed in December because he was accused of planning to overthrow the government. The family members that were arrested and executed included Jang's children, brothers, and grandchildren. This action was part of a larger effort by Kim Jong-Un to remove any threats to his power by getting rid of people connected to his uncle.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who did Santa Anna demand the executions of?  The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces.

Please answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How does the actress feel about the playwright?

Solar energy In the last two decades, photovoltaics (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286 USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceed 20% and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics is over 40%.

It is essential to maintain accuracy and avoid assumptions when interpreting information. Thus, we cannot definitively conclude that the phrase \\"A view through a door into a small tiled room where a father and his two sons are asleep on the floor\\" is an accurate interpretation of the initial description. There are several reasons why we cannot make this conclusion: 1. Lack of context: The initial description does not provide any information about the relationships between the individuals in the room. Therefore, we cannot assume the man is the father of the two children. 2. Alternative relationships: The man could have a different relationship to the children, such as an uncle, older sibling, babysitter, or family friend. There is no evidence suggesting that the man is definitively the father of the children. 3. Gender of the children: The initial description states that two children are in the room, but their genders are not specified. We cannot accurately assume that the children are both sons. They could be daughters, or one child may be a son while the other is a daughter. 4. Adoption or foster care: Even if the man is acting as a father figure to the children, they may not be biologically related. The children could be adopted, or the man may act as a foster parent, which would complicate the relationship between the man and the children. 5. Temporary situation: It is essential to consider that the situation observed in the room could be temporary. For example, the man and the children may be sleeping in the room out of necessity, such as during a natural disaster or due to other circumstances. In this case, they may or may not be related. In conclusion, although it is possible that the phrase \\"A view through a door into a small tiled room where a father and his two sons are asleep on the floor\\" could describe the scene, we cannot be sure based on the initial description alone.

Elena was a far better actor than Jennifer because","output":"Elena had a natural talent for acting that seemed to come from deep within her soul. She had spent her entire life mastering the craft, pouring her heart and soul into every role she took on. From the stage of her small town elementary school to the lights of Broadway, Elena embraced every opportunity she had to grow, learn, and perfect her art. Jennifer, on the other hand, although an adequate actress, struggled to connect with her characters in the same profound way as Elena. She too had dabbled in acting since childhood, but somehow she never quite managed to translate her love for the craft into a genuinely riveting performance. Elena's natural magnetism and ability to uncover the underlying emotions of her character came from years of relentless rehearsal and introspection. She had an innate understanding of human emotions that went far beyond anything that could be taught in a class or learned in a script. This gift allowed her to give life to her characters, rendering them at once vivid and believable. The genuine emotions emanating from her evocative performances kept her audience on the edge of their seats, breathlessly captivated by every word and subtle movement that she made. Jennifer, while a hard worker with a fierce passion for acting, did not possess the same innate emotional intelligence that Elena did. She was diligent in her studies, attending workshops, and seeking guidance from seasoned professionals, yet she somehow always fell short of the depth and complexity that Elena could effortlessly embody. Another aspect that set Elena apart from Jennifer was her unmatched versatility. Whether she was playing an angst-ridden teenager or an 18th-century queen, Elena could seamlessly shift from one role to another, translating her deep understanding of the human experience into wildly different characters with ease. Her ability to transform into seemingly any character she desired was nothing short of awe-inspiring, leaving those who had the pleasure of witnessing her craft, absolutely mesmerized. While Jennifer did her best to keep up with the ever-changing whims of casting directors and the diverse demands of the acting world, she often found herself pigeonholed into specific types of roles. Her acting range seemed to have a limit, and although she strove to break free from its constraints, she could not shake off her own barriers. Elena and Jennifer had a distinct, innate difference in their drive and willpower to constantly grow and evolve as artists. Jennifer was often hesitant to venture too far out of her comfort zone, afraid that her weaknesses would be exposed. Elena, on the other hand, had an insatiable hunger for self-improvement, always seeking out new challenges and fearlessly embracing them with open arms. This unrelenting determination to evolve as an actor made Elena truly exceptional in her field. It was these various factors - natural talent, emotional intelligence, versatility, and fearlessness - that set Elena apart from Jennifer, solidifying her status as the better actor. Despite their differences, both women shared a deep love for acting, and both had dedicated their lives to pursuing their passion. While Elena had reached greater heights, it was her unwavering commitment to growth and an unwavering thirst for excellence that ultimately allowed her to surpass Jennifer and become an extraordinary actor, revered by not only her peers, but also by an adoring audience that longed to be swept away into the magic of her stories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The series consists of three volumes:  - David Eddings (July 7, 1931  June 2, 2009) was an American fantasy writer. With his wife Leigh, he authored several best-selling epic fantasy novel series, including \\"The Belgariad\\" (198284), \\"The Malloreon\\" (198791), \\"The Elenium\\" (198991), \\"The Tamuli\\" (199294) and \\"The Dreamers\\" (200306).  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - The Tamuli is a series of fantasy novels by David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes:  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - The Malloreon is a five-part fantasy book series written by David Eddings, which follows \\"The Belgariad\\". The Malloreon is set in the same world as The Belgariad, but expands on several aspects of the setting, especially the eastern continent of Mallorea.  - The Belgariad is a five - book fantasy epic written by David Eddings , following the picaresque journey of protagonist ' Garion ' and his companions , first to recover a sacred stone , and later to use it against antagonist ' Kal Torak ' .  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.

In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis.

Scientists have just landed on both and are in the process of analyzing the environment and atmosphere of each planet. What is immediately apparent is that both planets are remarkably similar to Earth since both are oxygen rich and do not require a space suit to breathe. Another similarity that one of the planets, Jarthrow, has with Earth is that it naturally outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does. The other planet, Millhouse, outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases. Climate scientists are rushing to try to see if anything new can be discovered to help out our planet with these new discoveries.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will Millhouse have a higher or lower temperature than Jarthrow?  Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. A:","output":"Given the information provided, Millhouse will have a higher temperature than Jarthrow. This is because Millhouse outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases as Jarthrow. The presence of more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to an increased amount of terrestrial radiation being trapped, which in turn results in a higher global temperature. This phenomenon is known as the Greenhouse Effect. Since Millhouse has a higher concentration of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere, the Greenhouse Effect will be more pronounced on Millhouse, leading to a higher temperature compared to Jarthrow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign. For example, the absolute value of -2 is 2, and the absolute value of 5 is 5. In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to return the element with highest absolute value. If a negative and positive element have the same absolute value you should return the positive element. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. After finding the element with the maximum absolute value you should return the value of that element before you applied the absolute value. Q: [-7.806 68.781 -6.331] A:","output":"The given list of numbers is [-7.806, 68.781, -6.331].  To accomplish the task, we need to get the absolute value of each number in the list, which removes the sign and gives us a non-negative corresponding number. We then find the max out of these. If we encounter negative and positive numbers with the same absolute value, we return the positive one. The absolute values are:  |-7.806| = 7.806  |68.781| = 68.781 |-6.331| = 6.331 Now, we can see from these that the maximum absolute value is 68.781 (of 68.781). Then, we keep in mind that we should return the original number, with its initial sign. Therefore, the answer is 68.781."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Process: - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down.  Question: suppose there is more need to eat happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"In the given context, it seems the term \\"need to eat\\" might be a misinterpretation. Therefore, for the purpose of providing a detailed answer, let's assume the question is about increased weathering due to external factors.  If external factors cause an increase in weathering rates, they can affect the intensity and speed of the weathering processes, which in turn could lead to more rapid rock breakdown and erosion. Some of these factors can include climate changes, human activities, and natural disasters, among others. Here, we will discuss how an increase in the need for weathering might influence the second effect mentioned, which is the freeze-thaw action in rocks. When there is an increased need for weathering, due to either environmental changes or human intervention, the impact on the freeze-thaw process can either be more, less, or have no effect depending on various conditions. 1. More effect: If the external factors lead to a significant increase in the frequency of freezing and thawing cycles, the freeze-thaw action will be intensified. For instance, if a region experiences more frequent and drastic temperature changes, water within the rocks will freeze and thaw at a faster rate, causing cracks to widen and leading to more rapid disintegration of the rocks. This could escalate the weathering process and result in accelerated rock breakdown.  2. Less effect: Alternatively, the increased need for weathering might lead to a decrease in the impact of the freeze-thaw process if the external factors primarily influence other weathering mechanisms. For example, if a region undergoes increased chemical weathering due to an influx of acidic precipitation, the effect of the freeze-thaw process might be deemed less significant as chemical processes contribute more to the overall weathering rates. 3. No effect: In some cases, the increased need for weathering and its impact on the freeze-thaw process might be unrelated. This can happen if the external factors influencing increased weathering rates do not modify the temperature cycles or affect other mechanisms responsible for water continuously entering and leaving rocks. As a result, the freeze-thaw process would continue to occur at its normal rate, and there would be no effect on this particular weathering process. Finally, it is important to note that the interplay between factors that increase the need for weathering and their impact on various weathering processes can be highly complex, depending on the specific environmental context and changes involved. In some cases, the impact might be more, less, or have no effect on the freeze-thaw process but could also influence other weathering mechanisms, leading to a broad range of outcomes in terms of overall rock breakdown and erosion rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, we have a poem: \\"if it get that thing give that thing a swing if it get that thing give that thing a change if it get that thing then you just do your thing\\" Here are my step-by-step analysis: 1. Vocabulary: The vocabulary in this poem is very simple and straightforward. There are no complex words or phrases, which is more typical of an elementary school student's vocabulary range. 2. Complexity of Sentence Structure: The sentence structure is simple and repetitious, with each line following the same basic pattern. This might suggest the writing of an elementary school student as high school students are likely to use diverse and complex sentence structures. 3. Depth of Theme: The theme doesn't appear to be overly complex, however, it does show a level of creative thinking and abstract ideation. It's a little hard to pin down the exact grade level based only on the theme. 4. Coherence of Thought: The poem does have a certain rhythm and follows a somewhat structured pattern of repetition. However, it lacks clear, defined thoughts or ideas, which can indicate a younger child's writing. Based on these observations, I would predict that the poem is written by a kid in elementary school. It's important to note that this is not a precise science, and there can be great variability in writing abilities at any age.

How does this story end? (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden delivered a rousing address to the NAACP in Houston on Thursday, bolstering support for President Barack Obama and drawing sharp contrasts with the Republican Party on civil rights issues. On the heels of recent voter identification disputes, Biden strayed from his typical campaign speech to zero in on voting rights, arguing that Republicans were making it more difficult for certain group to vote. By implementing laws requiring voters to present official identification at the voting booth, Biden said, the GOP sees \\"a different future, where voting is made harder, not easier.\\" Democrats have said that such laws are politically motivated and intended to suppress minority voting, given that fewer people in minority groups carry government-issued IDs. Republicans, meanwhile, make the case that such laws prevent fraud and protect the integrity of the system. \\"We declined a few weeks ago, and (the) NAACP was pleased (Vice President","output":"Biden paused, sensing the crowd's anticipation. \\"We declined, and the NAACP was pleased, to make it clear that we stand for the vital principle of one man, one vote,\\" he continued, to roars of approval from the audience. The Vice President went ahead and highlighted the Obama administration's effort in providing equal rights and opportunities for all, underlining the key achievements that the administration had made over the past few years. He shared the significant improvements in healthcare, education and employment rates among minority communities. He also documented the administration's efforts in criminal justice reform and the strategic steps taken to reduce the racial disparities in sentencing. In his address, Biden also emphasized the importance of ensuring fair and free access to the ballot box. He highlighted how the administration was supporting grassroots movements, working hand in hand with civil rights organizations like the NAACP, to fight against these suppressive voting laws. \\"But it's not enough just to fight against these regressive laws,\\" Biden told the crowd. \\"We must also do everything we can to make it easier for every citizen to exercise their right to vote.\\" He highlighted the need for automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights to ex-felons who have served their time, and guaranteeing early voting in every state.  Biden finished his address by acknowledging that despite the progress made, many challenges still lay ahead. He urged the NAACP and all in attendance to stay involved, stay active, and continue the fight for equality, justice, and democracy. Mustering the energy in the room, he underscored the importance of the upcoming elections and encouraged everyone to cast their votes, stating that every single vote counts and can make a major difference in shaping the nation's future. \\"In the end,\\" Biden said as he wrapped up the address, \\"it's not about Democrats or Republicans. It's about ensuring every American has an equal say in our democracy.\\" The Vice President's speech was received with a standing ovation. His words left an indelible impression on the audience, rekindling their commitment to fight against voter suppression and inspiring them to be part of the democratic process to shape a future wherein equal rights, justice and opportunity were affirmed for all.  Soon after, reports emerged that the NAACP, bolstered by Biden's words, increased its efforts to register voters and fight voter suppression laws. Biden's speech was not just a defining moment for the NAACP and the civil rights movement, but it marked a significant moment in the nation's history as it resonated with millions of Americans and ushered renewed momentum in their collective quest for justice and equal voting rights for all."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Poultry Since their domestication, a large number of breeds of chickens have been established, but with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin. In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well. Q: Are there any purebreed lines for poultry today?","output":"Yes, there are purebred lines for poultry today. While commercial poultry production primarily uses hybrid birds, there are still many purebred chicken breeds maintained and preserved by poultry enthusiasts, small-scale farmers, and breed associations. These purebred lines often have distinctive characteristics and traits, such as appearance, egg-laying capabilities, adaptability to specific climates, or unique behaviors, making them valuable for various purposes aside from large-scale production. Some popular purebred chicken breeds include Rhode Island Red, Plymouth Rock, Sussex, Orpington, and Wyandotte."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Secure the jaws of a wire stripper 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end of one of the wires you’re splicing together. Squeeze the handles together firmly together and pull the jaws toward the end of the wire to remove the insulation. Repeat the process on the end of the other wire you’re splicing as well.  You can get wire strippers from your local hardware store. If you don’t have a wire stripper, you can also slice through the insulation with a utility knife. Just be careful not to cut through the actual wire inside. If you accidentally break strands off of a stranded wire, then the wire could cause a fuse to blow. Cut any remaining strands on the wire and try stripping it again. Get heat-shrink tubing that’s a gauge larger than the wire you’re using so you can easily slide it on. Cut a piece of tubing that’s at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) long so it’s able to cover the splice and some of the insulation later on. Slide the heat-shrink tubing onto one of the wires and move it at least 1 foot (30 cm) away from the exposed end.  You can buy heat-shrink tubing from your local hardware store or online. Avoid using heat-shrink tubing that’s too large for the wire since you may not be able to secure it completely. Don’t keep the heat-shrink tubing near the area you’re soldering since it could shrink from the heat of your soldering iron. Line up the centers of the exposed wires so they form an X-shape. Bend one of the wires down to twist it around the other wire as tightly as you can so it has a firm connection. Make sure the end of the wire doesn’t stick up or point away from the splice or else you won’t have as firm of a connection. Repeat the process with the other wire so your splice looks even on both sides. Alligator clips are small metal grips that work well for holding wires in place without them moving around. Place the alligator clips vertically on a flat work surface so the jaws face up. Secure each of the wires into 1 alligator clip so the splice is supported off the work surface between them.  You can get alligator clips from your local hardware store. Make sure you work in a well-ventilated space since the fumes from the soldering iron can be harmful. Use a scrap piece of metal or a non-flammable material under the alligator clips to catch any solder spills. Rosin flux is a compound that helps clean the wires and allows the solder to stick to them. Put a bead-sized amount of rosin flux on your finger and rub it over the exposed wires. Try to coat the wires as evenly as possible so there’s a thin layer of flux on them. Wipe any excess flux off of the wires with your finger or a paper towel. You can buy rosin flux from your local hardware store.

A:","output":"Based on the review \\"OK Fine Love it,\\" I would recommend this app to a friend with a \\"Yes\\" rating. Here's a step-by-step justification of my decision: 1. Assess the words used in the review: The reviewer uses three separate phrases - \\"OK,\\" \\"Fine,\\" and \\"Love it.\\" 2. Determine sentiment for each phrase:    a. \\"OK\\" - Neutral sentiment, neither negative nor positive.    b. \\"Fine\\" - Slightly positive sentiment, not necessarily enthusiastic.    c. \\"Love it\\" - Strong positive sentiment, expressing a high level of satisfaction. 3. Combine sentiments: Although the review starts with neutral and slightly positive sentiments, the stronger positive sentiment of \\"Love it\\" indicates overall satisfaction. 4. Compare options: Given the overall positive message of the review, a simple \\"Maybe\\" doesn't convey the reviewer's satisfaction. As there are no negative sentiments in the review, \\"Not at all\\" and \\"No\\" are not appropriate. 5. Finalize recommendation: The option \\"Definitely\\" suggests complete confidence based purely on the review.

When the ocean has waves far apart they have less energy or more energy? Answer:","output":"In the context of ocean waves, energy is related to both the wavelength and the height or amplitude of the wave. Waves with shorter wavelengths, in general, have more energy per unit length. However, the total energy of a wave is a combination of the energy of its amplitude and wavelength.  When ocean waves are far apart (i.e., have a longer wavelength), they may carry more or less energy depending on their amplitude or height. If the long-wavelength waves have a large amplitude or height, they can potentially carry more energy than shorter wavelength waves with smaller amplitude. Conversely, if the long-wavelength waves have a small amplitude, they may carry less energy than shorter wavelength waves with larger amplitude. To provide a more detailed insight, the energy of ocean waves can be calculated using the following formula: E = (1/8)ρgH²L where: E = wave energy per unit length, ρ = water density (approximately 1,025 kg/m³), g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), H = wave height (amplitude), L = wavelength. As per this formula, the wave energy is directly proportional to the square of the wave height (amplitude) and the wavelength. Therefore, if the ocean waves are far apart (longer wavelength) and have a higher wave height, they will carry more energy. However, the opposite is true if the ocean waves are far apart and have a low wave height."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The captain of the patrol curses the land when they see nothing. Then, the unit is suddenly ambushed by hundreds of Vietminh soldiers who kill the officers and, although the unit kills many Vietminh, it is eventually overrun. One Vietminh officer, Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don), hypothesizing that if they take no prisoners the French will eventually stop sending troops, orders the execution of all surviving French soldiers.Eleven years later, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a dedicated U.S. soldier, is deeply committed to training his troops, who are preparing to be sent to Vietnam. The night before their departure, the unit's officers hold a party to celebrate. Moore learns from a superior officer that his unit will be known as the 1st Battalion / 7th cavalry regiment. He is disquieted because the 7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer in the 19th Century when he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Moore is also dismayed because President Lyndon B. Johnson has decreed that the war would be fought \\"on the cheap,\\" without declaring it a national emergency. As a result, Moore believes he will be deprived of his oldest, best-trained soldiers (a formal declaration of war would have meant mobilization and extension of the terms of enlistment for volunteer soldiers) - about 25% of his battalion - just prior to shipping out for Vietnam. Before leaving for Vietnam, Moore delivers a touching speech to his unit:\\"Look around you, in the 7th Cavalry,we got a Captain from the Ukraine, another from Puerto Rico, we got Japanese, Chinese, Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indian, Jews and Gentiles, all American.

Some primitive animals use diffusion for the exchange of water, nutrients, and gases. However, complex organisms use the circulatory system to carry gases, nutrients, and waste through the body. Circulatory systems may be open (mixed with the interstitial fluid) or closed (separated from the interstitial fluid). Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptions during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. Fish have a two-chambered heart with unidirectional circulation. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart, which has some mixing of the blood, and they have double circulation. Most non-avian reptiles have a three-chambered heart, but have little mixing of the blood; they have double circulation. Mammals and birds have a four-chambered heart with no mixing of the blood and double circulation.   Q: In most animals, the circulatory system is used to transport blood through the what?

Toyota President Akio Toyoda apologized for the incident at a news conference and reiterated the company's belief that Hamp had no intent of breaking the law.      \\"To me, executives and staff who are my direct reports are like my children,\\" he said.      \\"It's the responsibility of a parent to protect his children and, if a child causes problems, it's also a parent's responsibility to apologize.\\"      Japanese media reports, citing police investigators, said 57 addictive Oxycodone pills were found in a small parcel labeled \\"necklaces\\" that was sent from the United States and addressed to Hamp in Japan. The pills were in packets or buried at the bottom of the parcel, which also contained toy pendants and necklaces, they said.      Hamp, a former General Motors Co and PepsiCo Inc executive, told police she did not think she had imported an illegal substance, a spokesman for Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department said.      A police official declined to comment on the latest media reports about the parcel.      Hamp was appointed managing officer in April as part of a drive to diversify Toyota's male-dominated, mostly Japanese executive line-up. She joined Toyota's North American unit in 2012 and this month relocated to Tokyo, where she was to be based. She had been staying in a hotel, a Toyota spokeswoman said.      Toyoda vowed that the automaker would maintain its policy of seeking out talent regardless of gender or nationality and expressed regret that the company had not provided enough support for an employee who was not Japanese and had come to live in Japan.      Oxycodone is a prescription drug in both the United States and Japan. Bringing it into Japan requires prior approval from the government and it must be carried by the individual, a health ministry official said.      Hiroaki Okamoto, a criminal defense lawyer at the Nakamura International Criminal Defense Office in Tokyo who is not involved in Hamp's case, said the large number of pills meant that, if indicted, she could face years in prison, followed by deportation.      The maximum sentence for smuggling drugs with the intent to sell is life in prison, he said. Even if indicted for smuggling for personal use, it would be tough to get a suspended sentence because of the large number of pills, he said.

President Akio Toyoda adjusts his glasses as he attends a press conference in Tokyo Friday, June 19, 2015. Toyoda said he believes an American executive arrested on suspicion of importing... (Associated Press)      TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. President Akio Toyoda said Friday he believes an American executive arrested on suspicion of importing a controlled drug into Japan had no intention of breaking the law.      Julie Hamp, Toyota's head of public relations and its first senior female executive, was arrested Thursday for allegedly importing the painkiller oxycodone. She was the first foreign Toyota executive to be fully stationed in Japan, and was in the process of moving her belongings from California.      At a hastily called news conference Friday, Toyoda bowed and apologized for the troubles set off by the arrest of Hamp, who was tapped as Toyota's chief communications officer in April.      He said the company should have done more to help with Hamp's relocation. He declined to go into details of the police allegations, only repeating several times that the company was cooperating fully with the investigation.      The drug was found by customs officials in a package Hamp sent to herself by air mail from the United States, according to police. Japanese media reports said the drugs were hidden in various parts of a jewelry box.      The high-profile stumble of a media-savvy executive, so early in the game, is an embarrassment for the world's top-selling automaker. Toyota had highlighted Hamp's appointment with much fanfare as a sign that it was promoting diversity.      Toyoda said he had picked Hamp, 55, because of \\"her character.\\" She was an excellent leader, communicating well with Japanese employees, he said.      \\"For me and for Toyota, she is an indispensable and precious teammate,\\" he told reporters. \\"I believe that we will learn that she had no intent to violate the law.\\"      He acknowledged that her appointment had been a \\"big step\\" in a globalizing Toyota. Although Japanese Toyota officials had gone abroad to live, she was the first foreign Toyota executive to be fully stationed in Japan.      It was unclear when she might be released. Japanese authorities can detain suspects without charge for up to 23 days.      Japan has strict controls over drugs. Possession of marijuana, for instance, is a serious crime. Foreigners being detained for mailing or bringing in medicines they used at home is not unheard of. Such drugs may be banned in Japan or require special approval.      The U.S. Embassy in Japan warns on its Internet site that Americans can be detained for bringing in prescription drugs that may perfectly legal in the U.S.      Earlier this year, Oregon woman Carrie Russell, 26, was detained for 18 days in Japan over a shipment of prescription Adderall for attention-deficit disorder. The drug is commonly prescribed in the U.S. but contains amphetamines, which are outlawed in Japan.      She had come to Japan to teach English and shipped in the unopened package of pills that her mother had sent from the U.S. to South Korea. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy worked for Russell's release.      Japan's government has been beefing up its crackdown on drug abuse this year.      About 250 cases of drug smuggling are recorded a year, according to recent government data, with about half of the cases involving foreigners including Americans. It is unclear which ones were over prescription drugs.      Public relations experts say Hamp may have to resign because, even if it turns out to be an honest mistake, it's still a mistake and one that reflects lack of awareness about a country she would be expected to have some familiarity with.      Before joining Toyota in 2012, Hamp worked for PepsiCo Inc. and General Motors Co. She oversaw marketing and communications for the Toyota, Lexus and Scion brands in the U.S. before her latest promotion.      Toyota employees are held to a high ethical standard, and run-ins with the law, even minor misdemeanors, are rare and seen as a disgrace.      Toyoda, who faced criticism for being slow in reacting to Toyota's recall crisis of several years ago, emphasized he was responding quickly to the Hamp news.      \\"We still don't have all facts, and what I can say is limited. But I felt it's critical to tell you my thoughts in my own words,\\" Toyoda said.      ___      Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama ||||| Thursday’s arrest of a high-profile Toyota Motor Corp. executive highlights the danger globetrotters can face bringing psychotropic or other medications into nations where they are banned.      Julie Hamp, named Toyota’s first female managing officer in April, faces drug-smuggling charges after having oxycodone pills sent to her from the United States, said a spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, declining to be named on policy grounds. Her arrest was front-page news in Japan, coming amid a widely publicized crackdown on the sale of mood-altering herbs that previously fell outside the nation’s strict laws against recreational drugs.      Hamp denies that she imported illegal drugs, the police spokesman said. Toyota spokesman Itsuki Kurosu said in an emailed statement the company is cooperating with the investigation.      Hamp, 55, “said she did not believe she had imported narcotics when she was arrested,” another police official said.      By midday Friday, she had been sent to the prosecutor’s office, a third official said.      In a hastily arranged news conference, Toyota President Akio Toyoda apologized for causing a stir and vowed to cooperate fully with the investigation.      He said Hamp is a “very important colleague and for me and Toyota . . . we believe that the investigation will reveal that Ms. Julie Hamp had no intention to violate the law.”      Toyoda said he appointed her as the head of communications mainly due to her personality and efforts to work closely with other employees, adding she has been also trying hard to adjust to Japanese culture.      The parcel was sent on June 8 from the U.S. and arrived at Narita airport on June 11, the police official said.      The package, labelled “necklaces,” contained several small boxes, each holding accessories and several tablets, reports said, adding police suspect there had been an attempt to hide the drug.      Hamp was promoted to head of communications for the auto giant earlier this year — making her one of the company’s most senior non-Japanese executives — after previously working at Toyota’s North American division.      The incident illustrates the different perceptions of drugs such as oxycodone, an opioid pain medication, which are more casually prescribed in the U.S. No matter how routine at home, the use of psychotropic drugs is strictly controlled in Japan and foreign visitors need to be careful, said Robert Dujarric, a director at the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies of Temple University.      “It’s considered by the authorities as equivalent to a friend mailing you in the U.S. with opium from Afghanistan,” Dujarric said. “Psychotropic medicines as well as prescription drugs that are legal in the U.S. are illegal in Japan,” where there’s stronger concern about addiction, he said.      Earlier this year, Carrie Russell of the U.S. was detained for 18 days after her mother mailed her an amphetamine medication for attention-deficit disorder. The 26-year-old English teacher was released in March only after a personal appeal from American Ambassador Caroline Kennedy.      The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo warns its citizens to check before mailing or carrying medication to Japan, or face arrest and detention.      “Heroin, cocaine, MDMA, opium, cannabis, stimulant drugs including some prescription medications such as Adderall . . . are prohibited in Japan,” the embassy says on its website.      “Japanese customs officials or police can detain travellers importing prohibited items. Japanese customs officials do not make on-the-spot ‘humanitarian’ exceptions for medicines that are prohibited in Japan,” it warned.      Of the 13,121 individuals charged with drug crimes last year, 778, or 5.9 percent, were foreigners, according to national police data. More than 80 percent of the crimes involved methamphetamines.      The same year, cases of drug smuggling rose 11 percent to 245, according to police data, which does not indicate how many cases involved prescription medicines.      Japan allows individuals to bring restricted prescription drugs such as oxycodone into the country with prior approval, according to the health ministry’s website, which lists oxycodone as a “narcotic.”      It is possible that illegal imports of painkillers and other drugs are increasing, and police decided to send a strong message with the arrest of Hamp, Dujarric said.      “It’s either a strong message or there’s something else behind the story.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Toyota's first senior female executive, Julie Hamp, has been arrested on suspicion of illegally importing painkillers into Japan.

Vivien is despising, devious and habitually unfaithful while Lee is pathologically jealous.  On his return from a lengthy business trip to New York, Lee finds several cards addressed to Vivien signed \\"Love Always\\" and determines to kill her latest lover, Richard Fenton.  He confronts Fenton, who admits to his affair with Vivien, and persuades him to end the relationship by writing her a farewell letter.  He then kills Fenton, and stages the scene to look like a suicide, believing he has committed the perfect crime as the letter which Fenton had just written at his dictation has all the appearance of a suicide note. His scheme goes awry when he discovers immediately after the fact that Vivien and Fenton had in fact broken up some time before, and Fenton had been humouring him by writing the note.  He is guilt-stricken at having killed Fenton needlessly, and realises that any suggestion of suicide on Fenton's part in despair over Vivien will now seem absurd to the police.  When he discovers that Vivien now has a new beau, Jimmy Martin, he takes the opportunity to frame Martin for the crime, reasoning that this will serve the dual purpose of shifting suspicion away from himself while at the same time getting Vivien's current lover out of the way.  While he arranges matters so that all the evidence points to Martin, the policeman in charge of the case has his doubts about the case but is unable to catch Lee out.  Vivien begs her husband to intercede on Martin's behalf, promising to remain faithful in the future if he can devise a way to save Martin from the gallows without incriminating himself.  Lee comes up with what he thinks will be the perfect solution to save Martin and thus keep Vivien, but then discovers he may have underestimated her cunning.  Guess a valid title for it!

Also on board is their old nemesis, Sgt. Collins (Nat Pendleton). As the ship nears New York, Collins and his superiors search the men's belongings for contraband. A six-year-old French orphan, Evey (Beverly Simmons), whom Herbie and Slicker befriended, is found in Herbie's duffle bag. She is handed over to Lt. Sylvia Hunter (Joan Fulton), who delivers her to immigration officials in New York. However, during a shift change at the office, Evey is mistaken for a neighborhood kid and set free. Meanwhile, Herbie and Slicker are back to their pre-war occupation of peddling ties in Times Square. Collins is also back at his old job--a police officer assigned to the same beat. He is about to arrest the boys when Evey shows up and helps them escape. Herbie and Slicker attempt to adopt Evey, but are told that one of them must be married and have a steady income. Evey suggests that Herbie marry Sylvia. They show up at her apartment, but learn that Sylvia already has a boyfriend, Bill Gregory (Tom Brown). At one point Herbie and Slicker purchase what seems to be an ideal home for 750, but the seller doesn't want to let them see the interior prior to purchase.

Article: In our culture, the sources of what we call a sense of \\"mastery\\" - feeling important and worthwhile - and the sources of what we call a sense of \\"pleasure\\" - finding life enjoyable - are not always the same. Women often are told \\"You can't have it all.\\" Sometimes what the speaker really is saying is: \\"You chose a career, so you can't expect to have closer relationships or a happy family life.\\" or \\"You have a wonderful husband and children--What's all this about wanting a career?\\" But women need to understand and develop both aspects of well-being, if they are to feel good about themselves. Our study shows that, for women, well-being has two dimensions. One is mastery, which includes self-esteem, a sense of control over your life, and low levels of anxiety and depression. Mastery is closely related to the \\"doing\\" side of life, to work and activity. Pleasure is the other dimensions, and it is composed of happiness, satisfaction and optimism. It is tied more closely to the \\"feeling\\" side of life. The two are independent of each other. A woman could be high in mastery and low in pleasure, and vice versa . For example, a woman who has a good job, but whose mother has just died, might be feeling very good about herself and in control of her work life, but the pleasure side could be damaged for a time. The concepts of mastery and pleasure can help us identify the sources of well-being for women, and remedy past mistakes. In the past, women were encouraged to look only at the feeling side of life as the source of all well-being. But we know that both mastery and pleasure are critical. And mastery seems to be achieved largely through work. In our study, all the groups of employed women rated significantly higher in mastery than did women who were not employed. A woman's well-being is enhanced when she takes on multiple  roles. At least by middle adulthood, the women who were involved in a combination of roles-marriages, motherhood, and employment were the highest in well-being, despite warnings about stress and strain. Question: One can conclude from the passage that if a woman takes on several social roles,_.

Q:Information:  - Candlemass is an influential Swedish doom metal band established in Stockholm 1984 by bassist, songwriter and bandleader Leif Edling and drummer Matz Ekström. After releasing five full-length albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Candlemass disbanded in 1994, but reunited three years later. After breaking up again in 2002, Candlemass reformed in 2004 and have continued to record and perform since then. Candlemass is also the seventh best selling artist coming out from Sweden selling as of 2010 more than 15 million albums worldwide.  - My Dying Bride are an English doom metal band formed in Bradford, England in 1990. To date, My Dying Bride have released twelve full-length studio albums, three EPs, one demo, one box set, four compilation albums, one live album, and one live CD/DVD release.  - Bradford is in the Metropolitan Borough of the City of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, in the foothills of the Pennines west of Leeds, and northwest of Wakefield. Bradford became a municipal borough in 1847, and received its charter as a city in 1897. Following local government reform in 1974, city status was bestowed upon the wider metropolitan borough.  - Cradle of Filth are a British extreme metal band that formed in Suffolk in 1991. The band's musical style evolved from black metal to a cleaner and more \\"produced\\" amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic metal and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films.  - Martin Powell (born 19 July 1973 in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England) is an English musician. In 1991, Powell auditioned for the position of bass-playing in the band My Dying Bride, but was turned down as the band had just filled the position. Upon informing the band he was also a violin and keyboard player, he was hired as a session musician, before becoming the band's permanent violinist and keyboardist.  - Mark Alan Kelso (born July 23, 1963 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is a former American football player and current broadcaster. He was a member of the Bills teams that appeared in four consecutive Super Bowls from 1990-1993, and currently serves as the color commentator for the Buffalo Bills Radio Network.  - \\"Children of the Grave\\" is a song by Black Sabbath from their 1971 album \\"Master of Reality\\". The song lyrically continues with the same anti-war themes brought on by \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Electric Funeral\\" from \\"Paranoid\\", adding in Geezer Butler's pacifist ideals of non-violent civil disobedience. Two previously unreleased versions of this song are released on the deluxe edition of \\"Master of Reality\\". The first is a version with alternate lyrics, the second an instrumental version.  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Cryptal Darkness were an Australian doom metal band featuring Mark Kelson , now of The Eternal & InSomnius Dei and for a short period , former My Dying Bride / Cradle of Filth member , Martin Powell .  - Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward.

Originally formed as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war.  - Sheffield is a city and metropolitan borough in South Yorkshire, England.

The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind while he awaited trial. His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who hides information from his boss about a break in? ?  The action is set in San Francisco during the 1980s. Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop.

Charles Krauthammer (; born March 13, 1950) is an American syndicated columnist, author, political commentator, and former physician whose weekly column is syndicated to more than 400 publications worldwide. While in his first year studying at Harvard Medical School, Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed from the neck down after a diving accident, severing the spinal cord at C5. After spending 14 months recovering in a hospital, he returned to medical school, graduating to become a psychiatrist involved in the creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, and later developing a career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. He was a weekly panelist on PBS news program Inside Washington from 1990 until it ceased production in December 2013. Krauthammer criticized President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to succeed Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. He called the nomination of Miers a \\"mistake\\" on several occasions. He noted her lack of constitutional experience as the main obstacle to her nomination.  On October 21, 2005, Krauthammer published \\"Miers: The Only Exit Strategy\\", in which he explained that all of Miers's relevant constitutional writings are protected by both attorney-client privilege and executive privilege, which presented a unique face-saving solution to the mistake: \\"Miers withdraws out of respect for both the Senate and the executive's prerogatives.\\" Six days later, Miers withdrew, employing that argument: \\"As I stated in my acceptance remarks in the Oval Office, the strength and independence of our three branches of government are critical to the continued success of this great Nation. Repeatedly in the course of the process of confirmation for nominees for other positions, I have steadfastly maintained that the independence of the Executive Branch be preserved and its confidential documents and information not be released to further a confirmation process. I feel compelled to adhere to this position, especially related to my own nomination. Protection of the prerogatives of the Executive Branch and continued pursuit of my confirmation are in tension. I have decided that seeking my confirmation should yield.\\"  The same day, NPR noted, \\"Krauthammer's scenario played out almost exactly as he wrote.\\" Columnist E.J. Dionne wrote that the White House was following Krauthammer's strategy \\"almost to the letter\\". A few weeks later, the New York Times reported that Krauthammer's \\"exit strategy\\" was \\"exactly what happened,\\" and that Krauthammer \\"had no prior inkling from the administration that they were taking that route; he has subsequently gotten credit for giving [the Bush administration] a plan.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Why did she withdraw?","output":"Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to succeed Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor because she felt that protecting the independence of the Executive Branch and its confidential documents and information was more important than furthering her confirmation process. According to her statement, there was a tension between the preservation of the Executive Branch's prerogatives and the pursuit of her confirmation, which led her to decide that she should yield and withdraw from the nomination process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Information:  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - Sonata (Italian: , pl. \\"sonate\\"; from Latin and Italian: \\"sonare\\", \\"to sound\\"), in music, literally means a piece \\"played\\" as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\"), a piece \\"sung\\". The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and is vague. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regardedalongside the fugueas one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure.  - A Scots Quair is a trilogy by the Scottish writer Lewis Grassic Gibbon , describing the life of Chris Guthrie , a woman from the north east of Scotland during the early 20th century . It consists of three novels : Sunset Song ( 1932 ) , Cloud Howe ( 1933 ) , and Grey Granite ( 1934 ) . The first is widely regarded as an important classic ( voted Scotland 's favourite book in a 2005 poll supported by the Scottish Book Trust and other organisations ) but opinions are more varied about the other two .  - A trilogy (from Greek - \\"\\", \\"three\\" and - \\"-logia\\", \\"discourse\\") is a set of three works of art that are connected, and that can be seen either as a single work or as three individual works. They are commonly found in literature, film, or video games. Three-part works that are considered components of a larger work also exist, such as the triptych or the three-movement sonata, but they are not commonly referred to with the term \\"trilogy.\\"  - Lewis Grassic Gibbon was the pseudonym of James Leslie Mitchell (13 February 1901  7 February 1935), a Scottish writer.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'author'.

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

However, assuming that the gathering was a positive experience overall, the following emotions and thoughts might be experienced by Cameron: 1. Gratitude: Cameron would most likely feel grateful for the invitation from their friends, as it signifies their inclusion in the group and their friends' desire to spend time with them. 2. Happiness: Sharing a meal with friends is generally a positive and enjoyable experience. If the lunch was filled with fun conversations, laughter, and a warm atmosphere, Cameron would likely feel happy and content. 3. Increased camaraderie: Spending time together during the lunch would strengthen the bond between Cameron and their friends. As they engage in conversations and interact with one another, they gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives and emotions. This heightened camaraderie fosters a sense of acceptance and would positively impact Cameron's feelings after the lunch. 4. Relaxation: In many cases, social gatherings can serve as a form of relaxation and stress relief. If Cameron is facing difficulties or challenges in their life, the lunch might offer a temporary reprieve, allowing them to relax and enjoy the company of their friends. 5. Confidence: Cameron might also feel a boost in self-esteem after the lunch. Knowing that they are valued and appreciated by their friends can positively impact their self-confidence, leading to an increase in their overall well-being. 6. Motivation to maintain relationships: After feeling the warmth of friendship and the enjoyment of social interaction, Cameron may be more motivated to maintain and nurture their relationships. This will likely result in them making more of an effort to stay in touch with their friends or plan additional outings in the future. 7. Reflection on personal connections: The lunch experience could inspire Cameron to reflect on their personal relationships and the importance of balancing work, family, and social connections. This reflection might prompt Cameron to prioritize quality time with friends and loved ones more consistently.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the last name of the older composer who Wolfgang played their harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital?, using the article: During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, \\"an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries\\". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical \\"Symphony No. 0\\" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765. Wolfgang also wrote his first vocal works, the motet \\"God is our Refuge\\", K. 20, and the tenor aria Va, dal furor portata, K. 21., what would be the answer ?

She is stalked and attacked by a disfigured man wearing a blade-fixed glove. She awakens from the nightmare, but her mother points out four mysterious slashes in her gown. The following morning, Tina is consoled by her friend Nancy and her boyfriend, Glen. Later, Nancy and Glen sleepover with Tina following her mother's out-of-town departure. The sleepover is interrupted by Tina's boyfriend Rod, who tries to have sex to reconcile after arguing. Falling asleep, she sees the man and runs. Awakened by Tina's thrashing, Rod witnesses her being fatally slashed by an unseen force. He flees as Nancy and Glen find Tina, mistakenly blaming Rod. Nancy tells her father, Lieutenant Don Thompson, of Tina's death. The next day, Rod proclaims innocence to Nancy, but Don arrests him. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class and finds the man, calling himself Freddy Krueger, chasing her in the boiler room. Nancy burns her arm on a pipe and awakens in the middle of class, excusing herself. She notices the burn mark on her arm and is concerned. At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and nearly gets drowned by Freddy. Nancy goes to Rod, who tells her what happened to Tina, and Nancy believes Freddy is responsible for Tina's death. Nancy has Glen watch over her as she falls asleep. She tries to find Freddy and sees him preparing to kill Rod. He turns his attention on her; she runs and wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. Nancy and Glen go to the jail and discover Rod has been hanged in his cell by his bed sheet in an apparent suicide. At Rod's funeral, Nancy's parents become worried when she describes the man in her dreams. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a dream clinic.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Organisms that live in a hypotonic environment such as freshwater, need a way to prevent their cells from taking in too much water by osmosis. A contractile vacuole is a type of vacuole that removes excess water from a cell. Freshwater protists, such as the paramecia shown in Figure below , have a contractile vacuole. The vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by osmosis from the cytoplasm. After the canals fill with water, the water is pumped into the vacuole. When the vacuole is full, it pushes the water out of the cell through a pore. Other protists, such as members of the genus Amoeba , have contractile vacuoles that move to the surface of the cell when full and release the water into the environment.   Q: Organisms that live in freshwater environments often possess a contractile vacuole that prevents cells from taking in too much water through what process?

Choices:  - train - hatred - get angry - going to jail - public outrage  The rationale to choose \\"going to jail\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","output":"Going to jail. Step 1: Identify the context of the question The question mentions that Joe did something very bad, which implies he committed an act that is punishable or against the rules, morals, or ethics of society. Accordingly, we can infer that the punishment should be something related to the severity of his actions. Step 2: Evaluate each choice based on context - Train: This choice is unrelated to punishments and seems more like an object or action, making it irrelevant to the context of the question.  - Hatred: Though Joe might receive hatred from others due to his actions, it's not a structured or institutional form of punishment, making it less fitting as the answer.  - Get angry: Getting angry is a response, not a punishment, and again, is not a structured or institutional consequence for wrongdoing.  - Going to jail: This choice is a common and established form of punishment for individuals who commit severe wrongdoings or crimes. It is a structured and institutional form of punishment provided by law. - Public outrage: Similar to hatred, public outrage is not a structured or institutional form of punishment. It might be a consequence, but not a formal or prescribed punishment for wrongdoings.  Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer Based on the analysis in step 2, \\"going to jail\\" is the most suitable answer, as it directly refers to a known form of punishment and addresses the concept of punishment in the context of the question. The rationale for choosing \\"going to jail\\" is that it represents a structured and institutional form of punishment, which would be the most likely and fitting consequence Joe would face given his severe actions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The easiest way to adjust your jump rope’s size is by tying a knot or a couple of knots in the rope. Tie the knot as close to the handle as you can without letting the knot actually touch the handle. If you need more than one knot to adjust the size, tie one knot (or two) on each side of the rope. This method is best for beaded and cloth ropes. Make sure that you have enough space to jump rope and that you can see the topmost part of your jump rope as it swings over your head.  If you can jump rope in front of a large mirror, that is ideal.

Christopher grew up hunting while Kenneth lived in the city, so when they got lost in the woods","output":"on their impromptu camping trip, their backgrounds prepared them very differently for the challenges they would face. Christopher, who had spent most of his childhood roaming the dense forest with his father, felt at home among the towering trees and rugged terrain. He knew the types of plants that could be safely consumed and how to find fresh water in the wild. Thanks to his understanding of animal tracks and sounds, Christopher had an uncanny ability to navigate their way through the wilderness without a compass. The sheer confidence in his own capabilities filled him with a sense of calm, which he hoped would rub off on Kenneth. Kenneth, on the other hand, had been raised in a bustling metropolis, where the constant sound of traffic and honking of horns had been the soundtrack to his life - quite the opposite of the vast, quiet woods they now found themselves in. Initially, Kenneth found the situation nothing short of terrifying, as he had never been out of the safety of the concrete jungle he called home. Lacking the necessary wilderness skills, Kenneth leaned heavily on Christopher's expertise, which made him feel slightly incompetent. However, Kenneth had some redeeming qualities that proved beneficial throughout their misadventure. Growing up in a diverse urban environment, he had developed an excellent ability in problem-solving and critical thinking. He approached each new challenge they encountered with a level of resourcefulness and creativity that left Christopher pleasantly surprised. Their teamwork kept both of them in good spirits, despite encountering several setbacks. One day, they came across a large river blocking their path. Christopher's hunting instincts kicked in and he suggested they forge ahead and find a way around it. Kenneth took this as an opportunity to put his urban problem-solving prowess to good use. He proposed constructing a simple raft with materials found nearby, which would allow them to cross the river without having to deviate from their original course. After hours of hard work, they managed to build a makeshift raft and navigate their way across the river. Their adventure had brought them closer together and showed them that despite their different upbringings, their unique skills complemented each other perfectly. As the days passed, Christopher's knowledge of the woods continued to keep them safe and fed, while Kenneth found innovative solutions to various obstacles they faced. The two friends steadily grew more confident in each other's capabilities and their friendship deepened. They began to realize that their unlikely pairing had actually helped them survive and thrive in this unforgiving environment. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity spent wandering the forest, they stumbled upon a small hunting cabin, a sign of semblance and basis of hope for their rescue. With renewed determination, they worked together to signal for help, using their collective skills to create an impressive smoke signal that caught the attention of a nearby search and rescue team. Safely back in civilization, both Christopher and Kenneth reflected on their time lost in the woods, grateful for the bond they had forged and the lessons they had learned from one another. Their adventure taught them that no matter where they came from, they could always rely on each other. And that, they knew, was the most important survival skill anyone could ever have."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"No, \\"goof off in class\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What does Robin need to do before this?\\" Acquiring Kendall's knowledge to ace the calculus test implies that Robin should have been focusing on learning and understanding the required material to ensure success on the important test. Several reasons explain why \\"goof off in class\\" is an inappropriate answer in this context. Firstly, \\"goof off in class\\" suggests that Robin is not paying attention to the lessons being taught and may be engaging in distracting and unproductive behaviors. This attitude does not align with the motivation and commitment required to excel in an important calculus test. To ensure success, it is essential for Robin to participate actively in class, ask relevant questions, and engage in discussions that promote a better comprehension of the subject matter. Secondly, the process of acquiring Kendall's knowledge implies that Robin seeks guidance or assistance from someone who has successfully mastered the material. This further emphasizes the importance of being focused and proactive in understanding the concepts discussed in class. To benefit from Kendall's knowledge, Robin must be open to learning, receptive to feedback, and willing to practice the necessary skills. Thirdly, academic success is built on a foundation of discipline, hard work, and effective time management. \\"Goof off in class\\" contradicts these principles, as it suggests a lack of seriousness and dedication towards one's academic pursuits. To ace the important calculus test, Robin must demonstrate the right attitude, work ethic, and consistent effort to understand and apply the concepts effectively. In conclusion, \\"goof off in class\\" is not a valid answer for what Robin needs to do before acquiring Kendall's knowledge to ace the important calculus test. Instead, Robin should actively participate in class, seek guidance from proficient individuals like Kendall, practice the required skills, and adopt a disciplined approach in managing their time and commitments, ultimately ensuring a successful outcome on the test."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- A hearing for a soldier accused of killing Afghan civilians for amusement enters a second day Tuesday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. Military officials will determine if there is enough evidence to court martial Pfc. Andrew Holmes over the allegedly premeditated deaths of three Afghan civilians. Holmes is also charged with smoking hashish, possessing a dismembered human finger and wrongfully possessing photos of human casualties. He is accused of conspiring with Spc. Jeremy Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. On Monday, Spc. Ryan Mallett testified that he was on patrol with Holmes and Morlock in January when more than 20 soldiers were taking part in an operation to gather intelligence in an Afghan village. As he ran down to the scene, OPTIONS: - Afghan said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - Afghans said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - Andrew Holmes said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - CNN said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - Holmes said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - Jeremy Morlock said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - Joint Base Lewis-McChord said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - Morlock said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - Pfc said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - Ryan Mallett said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. - Washington state said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running.","output":"Holmes said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. This incident is part of a larger controversy surrounding the actions of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. The hearing aims to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a court-martial for Pfc. Andrew Holmes, who has been accused of participating in the unlawful killing of Afghan civilians for sport. Holmes is also facing charges related to drug use, the possession of a dismembered human finger, and the wrongful possession of photos of human casualties. The case against Holmes involves his alleged collusion with Spc. Jeremy Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then throw a grenade to make it appear that they were under attack. This would allow them to justify their actions as self-defense. During the hearing on Monday, Spc. Ryan Mallett testified that he was on patrol with Holmes and Morlock in January when more than 20 soldiers were involved in an intelligence-gathering mission in an Afghan village. Holmes claims that he tripped and fell during the patrol but managed to get back up and continue running. This detail may stand out as he and his defense team work to contest the allegations against him. However, the overall situation raises numerous concerns about the conduct of some U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, particularly in relation to the treatment of civilians and adherence to laws of armed conflict. The outcome of this hearing will be crucial, not only to determine the fate of Pfc. Andrew Holmes but also to shed light on the broader issues of accountability and adherence to the rules of engagement for the U.S. military in foreign territories like Afghanistan. If Holmes is found guilty, it could have significant implications for both his personal future and the reputation of the U.S. military in general. It is essential that the investigation be thorough and transparent to ensure that justice is served, and that any wrongdoing is appropriately addressed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Enroll in a degree program (optional). Network your way to a job. Article:","output":"Title: Charting a Career Path: Understanding Job Prospects, Learning Programming, Leveraging Experience, Pursuing a Degree and Networking In today's evolving job market, a successful career trajectory requires a strong understanding of one's job prospects, acquiring important tech skills such as programming, utilizing previous experiences, considering higher education, and networking effectively. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide to those looking to navigate their paths effectively through the competitive professional landscape. Firstly, understanding your job prospects is crucial in setting realistic expectations for career progression and target roles. Job prospects include potential job openings, advancements opportunities, anticipated salary, industry growth, and market demand for specific skills or roles. This can be assessed through extensive research on various industry trends, job market studies, and conversations with industry experts or mentors. Websites such as LinkedIn, Indeed, or Glassdoor can provide a wealth of information about potential roles, salary ranges, and employment opportunities in your chosen field. For instance, knowing the demand for a specific skill set, like programming, can tremendously boost your job prospects. Today, learning programming is more than just a career advantage - it's almost an imperative. Programming forms the backbone of many industries, from tech and finance to science and healthcare. Roles such as software developers, data scientists, or cybersecurity analysts are becoming increasingly prevalent and demand sound programming skills. There are ample ways to learn programming, such as online courses, coding bootcamps, or textbooks. Websites like Codecademy, Coursera, or Khan Academy offer affordable or even free programming courses. Learning a programming language, such as Python, Java, or C++, can open the door to a myriad of high-paying, in-demand jobs. Next on the list is drawing on your experience. Whether it's through internships, part-time jobs, volunteering, or other extracurricular activities, previous experiences often comprise a diverse skill set that can be leveraged in the job market. These skills may include teamwork, problem-solving, communication, or leadership. Incorporating these experiences effectively into your resume or job interviews can show potential employers your aptitude for real-world business scenarios and your ability to adapt and learn quickly. Another significant consideration is enrolling in a degree program. While not always compulsory, having a degree is often perceived as a measurement of specific skills, knowledge, and dedication. Certain fields such as healthcare and engineering may require specific degrees as a minimum prerequisite. However, in many industries, experience, continuous learning, and the right skill set can also lead you to success. In such cases, continuing education programs or professional certifications can be an alternative. Coursera, edX, and Google Career Certificates have been democratizing access to higher education by offering a variety of affordable, recognized degree and certification programs. Lastly, networking remains a key to professional success. Building relationships with industry professionals, attending industry events, participating in online forums, or joining professional organizations can heighten your visibility and open doors to job opportunities. Remember, many job openings are filled even before they hit the job boards through references or internal connections, so having a strong network can significantly boost your job prospects. In conclusion, understanding your job prospects, learning in-demand skills like programming, leveraging your experiences, considering education options like degree programs, and networking effectively create a robust foundation for a successful career. The modern job market is undoubtedly competitive, but with diligent planning and a strategic approach, anyone can carve out a fulfilling and rewarding career path. The journey of your career is yours to chart, so keep learning, stay innovative and seize the opportunities that come your way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tennessee would trail early in the first quarter as Bills running back Fred Jackson threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans.  The Titans would respond as running back Chris Johnson got a 28-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Vince Young hooking up with wide receiver Nate Washington on a 14-yard touchdown pass.  In the second quarter, Tennessee would increase their lead as kicker Rob Bironas booted a 38-yard field goal.  Buffalo would end the half with quarterback Trent Edwards finding Evans on an 8-yard touchdown pass. The Bills would tie the game in the third quarter with kicker Rian Lindell booting a 25-yard field goal, yet the Titans would explode with points in the fourth quarter.

The time and money that doctors spend on their medical education is probably one reason for this problem. A visit to a doctor's office costs from 15 to 50 dollars. It's so expensive. Many people in the United States think that doctors are overpaid. However, most doctors disagree. They say that they were asked to study medicine for a long time. Tuition for many years of medical education costs a lot of money. Doctors say that it is necessary for most medical students to borrow money from the bank to pay their tuition. Because their money must be repaid to the bank, young doctors need to receive a lot of money for their work. So they charge people high prices for medical care. Therefore the cost of medical care in America is high. Because high tuition is one cause of high costs, one way to lower costs would be to have medical school that are free or have low tuition.

Article: You might think that whether you choose a blue shirt or a yellow one to wear to work or college makes no difference to your day and those around you. However, an increasing number of experts argue that the colors we choose affect our mood  , our career and even our health. Color affects us to a greater degree than most of us realize. Color is used increasingly by doctors for influencing mood and state of mind, and for various types of medical treatment. Green is a good color if you are not feeling well, and possibly this is why we sometimes give flowers and plants to friends and relatives in hospital. It is also thought that turquoise , a \\"user-friendly\\" color, can treat stress and headaches. Companies use color to encourage us to buy their products. For example, purple, which mixes well with red, is used to show that a company has new ideas and the power to make them happen. Orange and blue are also recommended colors for companies to use, because orange is the color of communication and blue suggests safety. So this could be a particularly good combination. Companies have found that certain colors \\"speak\\" to specific age groups. They often use red to attract younger people to their products, for example, as it is lively and more youthful than colors like gold and navy , which older customers seem to prefer. Wearing different colors can affect how you feel and how others react to you, so it is important to consider this when deciding what to wear in the morning. If you want people to take you seriously, then wearing navy or black is good. Blue would also be helpful for an interview or oral examination because it relaxes you and makes you feel calm. Red gets you noticed by everyone and makes you feel energetic, but be careful, as it can raise your pulse rate and not everyone wants this effect. So think carefully before you leave the house or visit a friend with a gift. The colors you choose in both cases are a powerful tool. Are you making the right impression-- on yourself and on others?

Does the sentence \\"Local associations of a special kind are an amalgamation of one or more Landkreise with one or more Kreisfreie Städte to form a replacement of the aforementioned administrative entities at the district level.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What does a Kommunalverband besonderer Art require?\\"","output":"The sentence \\"Local associations of a special kind are an amalgamation of one or more Landkreise with one or more Kreisfreie Städte to form a replacement of the aforementioned administrative entities at the district level\\" provides a partial answer to the question \\"What does a Kommunalverband besonderer Art require?\\". Let's break down the sentence and the concept of a Kommunalverband besonderer Art to provide a more comprehensive answer. A Kommunalverband besonderer Art, which translates to \\"local association of a special kind\\" or \\"municipal association of a special kind,\\" refers to a unique form of local governance seen in Germany. This framework attempts to address specific challenges in administrative structure and public service provision that arise in certain regions due to varied factors such as regional particularities or historical developments. In the context of this sentence, a Kommunalverband besonderer Art requires: 1. The amalgamation of one or more Landkreise (plural of Landkreis), which are rural districts in Germany. Landkreise are in charge of managing general local administrative tasks, including environment, social welfare, and construction. 2. The combination of one or more Kreisfreie Städte (singular: Kreisfreie Stadt), which are urban districts or independent cities. A Kreisfreie Stadt functions as a city outside the jurisdiction of any Landkreis, allowing it to govern itself independently. 3. The replacement of the aforementioned administrative entities at the district level. This means that the Kommunalverband besonderer Art replaces the existing Landkreise and Kreisfreie Städte with new administrative structures at the district level, providing a more cohesive governance model. While the given sentence presents the primary requirements for the formation of a Kommunalverband besonderer Art, it is essential to understand that regional laws and regulations further determine the precise structure and functioning of these special local associations. As such, elements like shared responsibilities, representation mechanisms, and decision-making processes may vary depending on the specific situation of each Kommunalverband besonderer Art. In summary, the sentence provides a valid, albeit partial, response to the question \\"What does a Kommunalverband besonderer Art require?\\" by focusing on the amalgamation and replacement components. A complete answer would also address the uniqueness and varying nature of these special local associations, as well as their ability to adapt to regional conditions while maintaining effective local governance."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here is a goal: how do you heal a sprained ankle? How would you accomplish this goal?  a. stay off of it for three weeks.. b. don't run on it for three weeks..","output":"Answer: a. stay off of it for three weeks.. When you sprain your ankle, it means you have injured it by stretching or tearing the ligaments, which are strong bands that help hold your bones in place. To help it heal, you need to rest it by staying off of it for about three weeks. This means not walking or standing on it as much as possible, to give your body time to repair the injury. Answer b. don't run on it for three weeks.. is not completely right. While it's true that you shouldn't run on a sprained ankle, just not running isn't enough. You also shouldn't walk or stand on it too much either. And besides, a sprained ankle needs more than just not running; it also needs rest, ice, compression, and elevation, which you'd get from staying off of it. When you twist your ankle, think of it like a toy that's broken. You shouldn't keep playing with it. Instead, you should let it rest and give it time to fix itself.

Please answer this question: Also the name of the local dialect, what is the term for an inhabitant of Monaco?","output":"The term for an inhabitant of Monaco is \\"Monégasque.\\" Monégasque is not only used to refer to the people of Monaco, but it is also the name of the local dialect spoken in the region. Monaco is a city-state located on the French Riviera in Western Europe and is bordered on three sides by France and one side by the Mediterranean Sea. It is the second smallest country in the world, with a total area of only 2.02 square kilometers (0.78 square miles) and a population of approximately 38,000. Even with its small size, Monaco is known for its affluent residents, glamorous lifestyle, elegant casinos, and prestigious events such as the Monaco Grand Prix. The Monégasque people have a unique identity and culture, which is predominantly shaped by their geographical location, history, and the influence of surrounding nations. The term \\"Monégasque\\" was derived from the name of the ancient Ligurian tribe called Monoikos, who inhabited the area in antiquity. The Monégasque dialect, also called \\"Munegascu\\" or \\"Munegu,\\" belongs to the Romance language family and is a dialect of Ligurian, which was historically spoken throughout the region of Liguria in present-day Italy and the southeastern part of France. This dialect has also been influenced by French, Italian, Occitan, and other Mediterranean languages. Although the majority of the population in Monaco speaks French, the Monégasque dialect is still used and preserved, particularly among the older generations. Monégasque is the traditional language spoken by the native population and is recognized as the co-official language alongside French, the official language of Monaco. It is taught in schools and supported by the government to keep the local dialect and culture alive. The Monégasque language has its unique expressions, syntax, and phonetic features, making it distinguishable from the neighboring French and Italian languages. In conclusion, a Monégasque refers to both an inhabitant of Monaco and the local dialect spoken by them. This term is deeply rooted in the history, culture, and linguistic heritage of the Monégasque people. As Monaco continues to evolve into a modern and vibrant cosmopolitan state, it also remains committed to preserving and promoting its unique identity and language represented by the Monégasque people and their dialect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In March 2001, Rice asked the CIA to prepare a new series of authorities for covert action in Afghanistan. Rice's recollection was that the idea had come from Clarke and the NSC senior director for intelligence, Mary McCarthy, and had been linked to the proposal for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice described the draft document as providing for \\"consolidation plus,\\" superseding the various Clinton administration documents. In fact, the CIA drafted two documents. One was a finding that did concern aid to opponents of the Taliban regime; the other was a draft Memorandum of Notification, which included more open-ended language authorizing possible lethal action in a variety of situations. Tenet delivered both to Hadley on March 28. The CIA's notes for Tenet advised him that \\"in response to the NSC request for drafts that will help the policymakers review their options, each of the documents has been crafted to provide the Agency with the broadest possible discretion permissible under the law.\\" At the meeting, Tenet argued for deciding on a policy before deciding on the legal authorities to implement it. Hadley accepted this argument, and the draft MON was put on hold. As the policy review moved forward, the planned covert action program for Afghanistan was included in the draft presidential directive, as part of an \\"Annex A\\" on intelligence activities to \\"eliminate the al Qaeda threat.\\" The main debate during the summer of 2001 concentrated on the one new mechanism for a lethal attack on  Bin Laden-an armed version of the Predator drone. In the first months of the new administration, questions concerning the Predator became more and more a central focus of dispute. Clarke favored resuming Predator flights over Afghanistan as soon as weather permitted, hoping that they still might provide the elusive \\"actionable intelligence\\" to target  Bin Laden with cruise missiles. Learning that the Air Force was thinking of equipping Predators with warheads, Clarke became even more enthusiastic about redeployment. The CTC chief, Cofer Black, argued against deploying the Predator for reconnaissance purposes. He recalled that theTaliban had spotted a Predator in the fall of 2000 and scrambled their MiG fighters. Black wanted to wait until the armed version was ready. \\"I do not believe the possible recon value outweighs the risk of possible program termination when the stakes are raised by the Taliban parading a charred Predator in front of CNN,\\" he wrote.  Question: \\"In the debate over the use of armed Predator drones what position did Clarke favor?\\" Answer: \\"Resuming Predator flights over Afghanistan as soon as weather permitted, hoping that they still might provide the elusive \\"actionable intelligence\\" to target  Bin Laden with cruise missiles\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

Context: After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the Kingdom of Asturias, King Alfonso III of Asturias knighted Vimara Peres, in 868 AD, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as Portucale, Portugale, and simultaneously Portugália — the County of Portugal. Later the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Spain due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the kings offspring. With the forced abdication of Alfonso III \\"the Great\\" of Asturias by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms of León, Galicia and Asturias. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 (León and Galicia in 914, Asturias later) under the crown of León.

Here is an article: There's cold, and then there's Arctic cold — and multiple major cities across the United States are about to experience the latter. A frigid cold front is expected to hit dozens of states across the Midwest and mountain regions over the next 72 hours, promising to turn Monday's work-related foot traffic into a scene from March of the Penguins. The cold front, which is predicted to bring temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees lower than average in states that already experience harsh January weather, is coming down from the polar regions above northern Canada. The pocket of cold air, called a \\"polar vortex,\\" was blocked up north by a high-pressure area that meteorologists refer to as a \\"ridge,\\" according to Mark Ressler, senior meteorologist at The Weather Channel. The ridge has high pressure on both the surface level and aloft, meaning miles above the Earth's surface. The ridge was formed by pools of warm water that have collected near the Gulf of Alaska, according to Joe D'Aleo, co-chief meteorologist at WeatherBELL Analytics. These pools of warm water, which are up to seven degrees warmer than normal, heat the surrounding air and expand it, raising the temperature and pressure, and block air from the Pacific Ocean as it tries to move eastward into Canada. A pool of warm water gathers near Alaska creating a pressurized ridge. Image: WeatherBELL Analytics This allows air from the Arctic to sit undisturbed in northern Canada, becoming colder and colder before flowing \\"like molasses\\" down south through Canada and into the United States, D'Aleo explained. In some places, the weather will be colder than it's been in 20 years. This same high-pressure ridge has been responsible for other odd weather patterns over the past few months, including a draught that has been plaguing Northern California, Ressler said. In San Francisco, for example, just over two inches of rain fell in the past six months; that's less than one third of the normal average, The Wall Street Journal reported. US will soon learn meaning of “polar vortex” as record cold descends on Midwest Monday. http://t.co/nHR2UuUopE pic.twitter.com/o1jwgp0uGC — Jim Roberts (@nycjim) January 4, 2014 The most extreme temperatures are expected to hit major U.S. cities on Monday, with the high temperature in Chicago expected to be -10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to D'Aleo. States in the northern plains and upper Midwest regions (i.e. North and South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin) are expected to be hit hardest, Ressler said. This cold air is not the only weather Americans should be wary of this weekend. The subzero temperatures are expected to hit after winter storm Ion is done pounding the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions with snow. The polar vortex may actually be worse than it would otherwise be following Ion and winter storm Hercules. These two snowstorms that have hit the mountain west, Midwest and northeast regions have built up the snowpack, which should help maintain the frigid temperatures of the polar vortex, Ressler said. The extreme weather is causing emergency alerts, possible school closings and will likely play a part in the NFL playoffs. (The Green Bay Packers host the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, with the city expected to get wind chill that could drop to as low as -51 degrees Fahrenheit.) Here's a look at how this week's upcoming cold spell will impact regions across the U.S.: This is the area of the U.S. that will likely be hit the hardest, Ressler said. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton already canceled all K-12 public schools statewide for Monday in anticipation of the cold weather. In North Dakota, Governor Jack Dalrymple is leaving the decision up to individual districts, but urged superintendents to remember that “keeping students safe is the first priority.\\" The National Weather Service is predicting wind chill in the South Dakota plains to hit between -40 and -50 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, and issued a \\"wind chill warning\\" to citizens reminding them that frostbite and hypothermia are possible with temperatures that cold. Heavy snow is expected to fall in St. Louis, Mo. on Saturday night and into Sunday, and wind chill may be as low as -25 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday. A lot of attention in this region will be focused on one specific location: Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisc., where the Packers are scheduled to host the 49ers Sunday afternoon in the first round of the NFL playoffs. The team finally sold out the nearly 73,000-seat stadium on Friday, meaning its faithful fans will be cheering on the Pack in wind chill that could reach as low as -51 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Sports Illustrated. (The temperature for Niners fans in San Francisco on Sunday: 66 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny.) Another playoff game between the Cincinnati Bengals and San Diego Chargers Sunday morning is expecting temperatures right around freezing at kickoff. Chargers defensive back Richard Marshall tweeted out the following picture of his team's practice ahead of the game on Saturday morning. Got to love this football weather #practice pic.twitter.com/c3FSAYpLMY — Richard Marshall (@TheMarshall31) January 4, 2014 The other major focus in this region is Chicago, which is expected to get another six inches of snow between Saturday and Sunday before subzero temperatures linger throughout the day Monday. In Indianapolis, trash pickup has been canceled on both Monday and Tuesday. New Yorkers were greeted with snow from winter storm Hercules on Friday, and after temperatures are expected to rise slightly on Sunday and Monday, Tuesday temperatures could be as low as single digits in Manhattan. Boston had a similar experience Friday, and meteorologists expect the temperature to reach zero degrees Fahrenheit Saturday night. The city's record low was -4 degrees Fahrenheit back in 1981. Snowfall led to school closures in both Virginia and Washington, D.C. on Friday, and areas of the capital are expected to have temperatures in the single digits on Monday. As bad as the storm and cold weather will be over the next 72 hours, things will break, according to D'Aleo. \\"It's only going to be a two or three day siege,\\" he said. \\"But it will be very harsh for those few days.\\" Citizens living in states where cold fronts are expected to hit are encouraged to stay indoors, if possible, and wear multiple layers if forced to venture outside. Hypothermia can start impacting people as soon as the temperature drops to 50 degrees Fahrenheit, which means temperatures over the next few days could put people at risk.

He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to  Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source,  Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack,  Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to  Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad. Al Qaeda members considered the video an effective tool in their struggle for preeminence among other Islamist and jihadist movements.

Clip off sprigs off as needed using scissors or pruning shears. Dry the harvested thyme sprigs somewhere warm and shady.\\"","output":"Title: The Perfect Moment to Harvest Thyme for Exceptional Flavor Introduction Thyme, a versatile and aromatic herb used in cooking and medicinal applications, is prized for its distinctive flavor. However, not everyone knows the secret to harvesting it at the optimum time to maximize the herb's taste. In this article, we will explore when to harvest thyme for the best flavor, how to clip off sprigs correctly, and the ideal drying process to ensure your harvested thyme retains its vitality. Step 1: Timing Your Thyme Harvest For the most flavorsome outcome, it is crucial to harvest thyme just before the plant begins to flower. Thyme typically flowers during the late spring to early summer months. At this point, the essential oils within the plant reach their peak concentrations, imbuing the herb with its characteristic aromatic properties. By gathering the thyme right before flowering occurs, you can capture the essence of the herb at its most potent and enrich your dishes with an exceptional taste. Step 2: Clipping Thyme Sprigs When the time comes to harvest your thyme, it's essential to treat it with care to maintain the plant's integrity. Utilizing scissors or pruning shears, gently clip off the sprigs as needed, taking care to make clean cuts without crushing the plant's delicate stems and leaves. This practice not only ensures a higher quality product for your culinary purposes but also promotes the continued growth and prosperity of your thyme plant. Step 3: Drying Your Harvested Thyme After harvesting your thyme, it's essential to dry the sprigs to extend their shelf life and concentrate their flavors further. The ideal drying location is somewhere warm and shady, as direct sunlight can cause the herb's volatile compounds to deteriorate, thus affecting its taste and aroma.  To dry thyme effectively, follow these steps: 1. Bundle the thyme sprigs together, and secure them with a rubber band or twine. 2. Hang the bundles upside down in a warm, shady, and well-ventilated spot. 3. Monitor the drying process, which can take up to two weeks. Thyme is dry when the leaves are brittle and easily crumble between your fingers. 4. Once dry, remove the leaves from the stems and store them in an airtight container to preserve their freshness. Conclusion Harvesting thyme at the perfect moment, using the proper tools for clipping sprigs, and adhering to sound drying practices can significantly impact the flavor of this versatile herb. By implementing these techniques, you can elevate the taste of your dishes and impart a delightful aromatic quality to many culinary creations. So, next time you grow thyme, remember to follow these steps and enjoy the full potential of this popular herb."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You should cover the table in a towel in case there is any spillage. Let the puppy lie down on all fours so that it is lying on its belly with its front legs outstretched and its back legs tucked up under it. Put a drop of the formula on the inside of your wrist to make sure that it is lukewarm and not too hot. Hold the puppy’s head firmly in between your index finger and thumb so that your fingers are located at the corners of the puppy's mouth. Tip the head slightly upward so that you can see what you are doing. Hold the end of the tube on the puppy’s tongue and let it taste a drop of the milk. Doing this will help coat the esophagus and get her ready to eat. You will not want to go too slowly or else the pup may gag. Guide the tube over the tongue and down into the back of the throat. You will know you are on the right track when the puppy starts swallowing the tube. If it coughs or gags, remove the tube and try again. Stop feeding the tube downward once the marked part of the tube reaches the pup’s mouth. Check to make sure that the pup is not coughing, crying or gagging. If she is not, secure the tube by placing it between your index and middle fingers. Put a small amount of water in the tube to check if your puppy coughs or gags. If it’s fine, attach the food syringe to the tube. If your puppy coughs, take out the tube and start over since the food could go into the puppy’s lungs. After securing the feeding tube, depress the plunger of the syringe and feed the puppy 1 cc or ml at a time. To know when to let the puppy rest between cc’s, count to 3 seconds in your head while slowly depressing the plunger. After the 3 seconds, check to see if there is any milk coming out of the puppy’s nose. If there is, withdraw the tube as this means that the puppy is choking. After you have checked, depress the syringe for 3 more seconds. Hold the syringe perpendicular to the puppy for the most efficient feeding method. Once all of the milk has been fed to the puppy, slowly remove the tube. To do this, gently pull it out while still holding the puppy’s head. Once the tube has been removed, place your pinky in the puppy’s mouth and let it suck on your finger for 5 to 10 seconds. Doing this ensures that the puppy will not throw up. If possible, bring the puppy to its mother. Its mother will lick the puppy’s anus, which will help the puppy to defecate. If the puppy is an orphan newborn, use a wet washcloth or cotton ball to simulate the mother’s licking. Doing this is very important, as defecating will help the puppy remove any waste dammed up in its intestines. To do this, lift the puppy and stroke its belly. If it is very firm, it has gas or bloating. If this is the case, you will need to burp the puppy. To do this, lift the puppy by placing your palm under her belly and lifting up. Stroke its back and rump to help it burp. After the 5 days are up, feed the puppy every 3 hours. Summary:","output":"1. Cover the table in a towel to prevent spillage. 2.

The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.  Paragraph: Doctor Jones studied two teams of workers. Team one had healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, but team two had people with sickle-cell anemia. the differences in health parameters were amazing and obvious.

It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price?

This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included.

Process: - The bat sends out sound waves from their mouth or nose - The sound waves hit an object - Echoes are produced - The echo returns to the bat&#x27;s ears - The bat hears the echo - The bat can figure out where the object is located.  Question: suppose the rock takes longer to break apart happens, how will it affect STRONGER echolocation.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"C: no effect If a rock takes longer to break apart, it will not have any significant impact on the echolocation abilities of bats. The process of echolocation in bats relies primarily on the generation of sound waves and the reception of resulting echoes, not on the structural integrity of the objects they detect. To better understand the reason behind this answer, let's dive deeper into the process of echolocation and the factors that could affect it. Echolocation is a biological sonar system used by bats, whales, and certain other animals to navigate and find food in their environment. It enables these animals to create a mental map of the surrounding area by emitting sound waves and then analyzing the echoes that return after bouncing off solid objects like rocks, walls, or other obstacles. The effectiveness of echolocation in bats depends on several factors, including: 1. The frequency and intensity of the emitted sound waves: Bats can produce sound waves with frequencies ranging from 20 kHz to as high as 200 kHz, depending on the species. Higher frequencies provide more detailed information about the objects' surface features and texture. The intensity of the sound waves determines the maximum distance at which the bats can detect objects. 2. The sensitivity of the bat's auditory system: Bats have highly specialized and sensitive ears that allow them to detect even the faintest echoes. This sensitivity is essential for echolocation, as it enables bats to perceive objects at greater distances. 3. The speed of sound in the medium: The speed of sound in air affects how quickly the sound waves travel through the environment and return as echoes. A slower speed of sound means that it takes longer for the waves to bounce off the objects and travel back to the bat. 4. The presence of other sounds and noises in the environment: Noise from wind, rain, or other animals may interfere with the bats' echolocation process by making the echoes harder to distinguish. Now, let's consider the scenario where a rock takes longer to break apart. While this may indicate that the rock is more robust than others, this does not necessarily mean that its density or other acoustic properties will change substantially. Even if the rock's density changes, it would affect the way the sound waves are absorbed or reflected, but not to a degree that would significantly impact the overall echolocation abilities of bats. A bat's echolocation success primarily relies on its ability to produce high-frequency sound waves, the sensitivity of its auditory system, the speed of sound in the environment, and the amount of noise interference. In conclusion, the time it takes for a rock to break apart is not a significant factor in determining the effectiveness of echolocation in bats. The essential factors, such as the frequency and intensity of emitted sound waves, the auditory system sensitivity, and the presence of other sounds, remain more critical in determining the success of the bat's echolocation process."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their last-second road loss to the Falcons, the Bears went home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played a Week 7 NFC North duel with the Minnesota Vikings.  In the first quarter, Chicago trailed early as Vikings RB Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run.  The Bears responded with QB Kyle Orton completing an 18-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen, along with RB Garrett Wolfe returning a blocked punt 17 yards for a touchdown.  Minnesota would answer with QB Gus Frerotte completing a 24-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe.  In the second quarter, it was back and forth.  Chicago kicker Robbie Gould would get a 26-yard field goal, while Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell got a 42-yard field goal.  Bears rookie CB Zackary Bowman would recover a fumble from Minnesota's endzone for a touchdown, while Vikings RB Chester Taylor got a 1-yard TD run.  Chicago closed out the half as Gould got a 48-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the high-scoring mayhem continued as WR Rashied Davis recovered a fumble within Minnesota's endzone for a touchdown.  The Vikings would reply with Peterson getting a 54-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Bears increased their lead as Orton completed a 51-yard TD pass to WR Marty Booker.  In the fourth quarter, Chicago continued its run as rookie RB Matt Fort&#233; got a 1-yard TD run.  Minnesota tried to rally as Longwell nailed a 23-yard field goal, along with Frerotte completing a 5-yard TD pass to former Bears WR Bernard Berrian.  Fortunately, Chicago's defense got the game-winning interception to seal the deal. With the win, the Bears went into their bye week at 4-3.

The Air Hollywood K9 Flight School is one place where such help can be found.  The school has a piece of equipment that provides the sights, sounds and even the feel of an airplane in flight. It is called a flight simulator . The simulator was built for filming airplane scenes in movies.  Sandy Alexander lives in Newport Beach, California.

The citizens, bundled in thick coats and scarves, navigated the slippery sidewalks with caution, gripping onto the railing and each other for support. As they trudged through the slush, their breaths formed beautiful, but transient pieces of cloud art in the air— a dance of warm and cold, with the chilly air nipping at their faces like an insistent lover. In the midst of this winter wonderland, the city's architecture stood tall, resilient against the frosty onslaught. Majestic, centuries-old cathedrals with their intricate stained-glass windows offered solace to the believers, while the towering skyscrapers of glass and steel housed the ambitious dreams of entrepreneurs and businessmen who were not deterred by the inclement weather. The warm, golden glow from the windows of cozy cafés and local pubs beckoned the weary wanderers, proffering the promise of warmth, company, and perhaps a cup of steaming, cinnamon-spiced cocoa. Despite the harsh conditions, the life of the city seemed to be amplified, rather than stifled. Street vendors called out to the briskly passing shoppers, enticing them with the sweet aroma of freshly baked pastries, steam rising from the display cases like a beacon of hope. Children laughed, bundled up in layers of colorful clothing, as they chased each other with snowballs and reveled in the simple pleasures of running from snowflake to snowflake, eager to catch the delicate crystals on their outstretched tongues. As the sun gradually dipped lower into the horizon, an orange-pink hue bathed the city, its soft diffused light reflecting off the surfaces of the frost, transforming the once cold and hostile environment into a breathtaking sight. The couples strolling hand-in-hand along the riverbanks exchanged sweet nothings as the last rays of sunlight shimmered and danced on the water's surface, a silent hymn to the beauty of wintertime. However, not all of the city's inhabitants were as fortunate as those who could find respite in the warmth of their homes or the kind embrace of a loved one. Underneath the crumbling facades of forgotten buildings, the homeless huddled together, seeking solace in the generosity of kind strangers and the meager warmth provided by their threadbare blankets and makeshift fires. Their faces, etched with the lines of hardship, held a glimmer of hope as they whispered stories of brighter days to come and clung to faith in the face of adversity. Yet, despite the cold's attempts to conquer, winter had also offered the gift of unity in the heart of the city. It was a time when families gathered together, sharing laughter and stories over a hearty meal as they basked in the glow of the fire. Neighbors, once strangers or mere acquaintances, lent each other helping hands as they shoveled snow and chipped away at stubborn sheets of ice. The camaraderie that developed forged bonds of friendship, and the stern-faced coldness that winter had brought upon the city was no match for the warmth that blossomed in the citizens' hearts. As darkness finally descended, the city was illuminated in brilliant arrays of twinkling, vibrant colors. String lights hung from rooftops and wrapped around enchanted evergreens, creating a spectacle of joy for all who beheld the magical scene. Snowflakes continued to drift down, coating the city in a blanket of sparkling diamonds while the nightlife emerged to dance the night away in the embrace of frozen beauty. In the midst of the city, alive and beating with purpose, the bridges that had once separated its inhabitants now stood as symbols of connection and unity, bringing everyone together in the warmth of shared experiences. And as winter's grip continued to tighten, the people of the city knew that they would withstand, flourish, and emerge stronger, for in the icy cold, they had discovered the unique treasure of shared warmth in each other's company – an extraordinary paradox at the heart of this winter wonderland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will meet at the luxury resort for nuclear talks next week in Singapore, the White House said Tuesday. (AP Photo/Yong Teck Lim) (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will meet at a luxury resort on Sentosa Island for nuclear talks next week in Singapore, the White House said Tuesday.      The historic meeting will be held at the Capella Hotel, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted.      \\"We thank our great Singaporean hosts for their hospitality,\\" Sanders said.      Trump and Kim's highly anticipated meeting is scheduled for 9 a.m. local time June 12 at — or 9 p.m. June 11 on the East Coast of the U.S. — after a flurry of on-again-off-again action.      Trump hopes to secure a nuclear deal with the North Koreans, seeking for Kim to give up his nuclear program, though he stressed last week that the process would likely take longer than a single meeting.      Located a quarter-mile off the coast of the city-state, Sentosa Island is known for its high-end beach hotels, golf courses and amusement parks. A U.S. advance team was spotted at the Capella Hotel last week meeting with North Korean officials in preparation for the summit.      The hotel is known for luxury amenities, impeccable service and, above all, privacy for business and leisure. Two of the hotel's buildings were built in the 1880s for British officers based on the island.      On Tuesday evening, workers were painting a fresh coat on the façade, extra security was in place and red carpets were being rolled out at the hotel's two entrances.      Officials had also considered the Shangri-La Hotel, which hosts an annual international security summit and was the venue for a 2015 meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou.      Trump is expected to stay at that hotel, which is near a major shopping district and less secluded than the island facility chosen for his meeting with Kim. ||||| Image copyright Reuters/Capella Singapore Image caption Mr Trump and Mr Kim will meet at the luxury Capella hotel on Sentosa island      The much-anticipated meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will take place at a hotel on the Singaporean island of Sentosa, the White House has confirmed.

Mr Trump said on Tuesday that plans were \\"moving along very nicely\\".      The US wants Mr Kim to commit to giving up his nuclear weapons.      But it is unclear exactly what is on the table for the discussions in Singapore. Mr Trump has suggested the first meeting will kick off a longer process of negotiations, calling it a \\"get-to-know-you situation\\".      \\"A lot of relationships being built, a lot of negotiations going on before the trip,\\" he told reporters on Tuesday. \\"It's very important - it'll be a very important couple of days.\\"      The summit would represent the first ever meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president.      White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed on Twitter that the summit would take place at the five-star Capella Hotel.      But it appears that the two leaders will stay elsewhere. Mr Trump will likely be at the Shangri-La Hotel, where US presidents have stayed before, while Mr Kim will probably stay at the St Regis Singapore, the Straits Times newspaper reports. The two hotels are on the main island, near the famous Orchard Road shopping strip.      Sentosa is one of 63 islands that make up Singapore.      The 500-hectare island, only a short distance from the main island, is home to luxury resorts, private marinas and plush golf clubs.      But the island also has a dark history of piracy, bloodshed and war.      It was a pirates' haunt      Singapore was established as a British trading post in the 19th Century. Its prime location on the major sea route between India and China made it an ideal choice.      But even before British rule, Singapore was a flourishing trade centre, frequented by merchants and traders, as well as pirates.      Sentosa was known at that time as Pulau Blakang Mati, which directly translates as the \\"island behind death\\" - a reference to its violent piracy reputation.      The island's population was mostly Malay, Chinese and the Bugis - seafarers originally from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.      It was a World War Two massacre site      Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942, after British colonial forces surrendered.      It was given a new Japanese name - Syonan, meaning Light of the South.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The now tranquil beaches of Sentosa were once marred by bloodshed      Over the next few years, thousands of people were killed by the occupying forces.      Chinese men between the ages of 18 and 50 were summoned to various sites before being machine-gunned to death and thrown into the sea.      Among the massacre sites were the beaches on Sentosa, near the Capella hotel where Mr Trump and Mr Kim will meet.      Sentosa also hosted a prisoner-of-war camp, which held some 400 Allied troops and gunners.      Tourism boom and fatal accidents      In the 1970s, the Singaporean government renamed the island Sentosa, meaning \\"peace and tranquillity\\", and began developing it as a tourism site.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sentosa has today been turned into a tourism hotspot, with the introduction of Universal Studios and the Resorts World casino      But the island's problems continued.      In 1983, two carriages on the tourist cable car plunged into the sea after an oil drilling vessel struck the ropeway.      A water park was opened - Fantasy Island - but was plagued by safety complaints. An eight-year-old girl died there in 2000 when her raft overturned. The park closed in 2002.      Sentosa has since re-invented itself as the \\"State of Fun\\". A Universal Studios theme park, a new water park and the Resorts World casino draw in thousands of Singaporeans and tourists each year.      The luxury backdrop to the talks      Image copyright Robert Reck/Capella Singapore      The 30-acre, 112-room Capella resort, nestled in tropical rainforest and designed by the firm of renowned British architect Norman Foster, features several grand colonial-era buildings.      It describes itself as a place \\"where old and new fuse together in luxury\\".      Rooms are on offer from about 500 a night (£370) for a Premier Garden King Room to 7,500 a night (£5,600) for the Colonial Manor with three bedrooms and a private pool.      White House staff have already had a preview of the venue, with Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Joe Hagin and other officials staying there as they have hammered out the details of the summit.      However, visitors hoping to grab a ringside seat will be disappointed. There are no rooms available from now until 15 June.      Playground of the rich and famous      Sentosa is home to one of the country's most prestigious residential enclaves - Sentosa Cove, where multi-million dollar homes with yacht docks can be found.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Yachts and boats are seen berthed at Sentosa's marina club      There is also an award-winning golf club with two courses, some of Singapore's most luxurious hotels and a handful of Michelin-starred restaurants.      So why Sentosa?      The island's location, just off the mainland, makes it a secure venue.      Access to the island can easily be controlled - there is just a cable car, a monorail, a pedestrian causeway and a vehicle tunnel.      And should the world leaders want a break from their historic talks, did we mention the golf courses? ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are set to meet at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island, Singapore, for historic nuclear talks on June 12.

Question: \\"What jewelry like accessories did he wear?\\"  Context: \\"When he became First Consul and later Emperor, Napoleon eschewed his general's uniform and habitually wore the simple green colonel uniform (non-Hussar) of a colonel of the Chasseur à Cheval of the Imperial Guard, the regiment that often served as his personal escort, with a large bicorne. He also habitually wore (usually on Sundays) the blue uniform of a colonel of the Imperial Guard Foot Grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs). He also wore his Légion d'honneur star, medal and ribbon, and the Order of the Iron Crown decorations, white French-style culottes and white stockings. This was in contrast to the gorgeous and complex uniforms with many decorations of his marshals and those around him.\\"  Answer:","output":"From the context provided, it can be deduced that Napoleon wore the following jewelry-like accessories as part of his ensemble: 1. Légion d'honneur star: This was a star-shaped decoration awarded as part of the French Legion of Honour, an order of merit recognizing exceptional service, civilian or military. 2. Légion d'honneur medal and ribbon: In addition to the star, Napoleon also wore the medal and ribbon accompanying the Legion of Honour, both of which are important elements of the decoration. 3. Order of the Iron Crown decorations: The Order of the Iron Crown was an Austrian and later Austro-Hungarian order of merit, awarded for significant civil and military accomplishments. Napoleon, as Emperor, adopted and revamped the order to reward his most loyal followers. These jewelry-like accessories served as symbols of Napoleon's accomplishments and distinguished status.

Dr. Robert Verne (Robert Foxworth) is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements, where he feels he isn't making a difference. He accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine.

She is pregnant, but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he against having children. When flying in, they meet Travis Nelson (Burke Byrnes) and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet paper mill director Bethel Isely (Richard A. Dysart), who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at Opies.

Q:Article: Millions of sports lovers are still thinking about one thing----the Winter Olympics in Sochi Russia. Close to 2900 men and women competed in the 2014 Winter Games about a month ago. The Olympics brought a lot of attention to Sochi, a city on the Black Sea, which is a popular area for vacation travelers. The area is known for its mild winters. At least 50 billion was spent on the 2014 Winter Games, making it the costliest Olympics in history. Seven billion dollars was spent on the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada. Olympic officials chose Sochi to host the 2014 games almost seven years ago. At that time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the games would cost about 13 billion. Yet the actual expenses exceeded his estimate. So where did all the money go? Some observers say the high cost is partly the result of security measures. Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert from the RAND Corporation, gave the following explanation. There were anywhere between 70,000 and 100, 000 policemen and military troops deployed around the city. The main threat came from separatist and Islamist groups from the North Caucasus, especially from Chechnya and Dagestan. One group claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings in Volgograd last December. The attacks killed more than 30 people. The city is only about 600 kilometers away from Sochi. Bruce Hoffman is a terrorism expert from Georgetown University in Washington DC. He says the increased security made Sochi a difficult target for terrorists. It is thought that the terrorists' intention was to make life difficult for the Russians and to create some sort of incident that would take away the enjoyment. The last Olympians from around the world on Russian soil were in 1980. That was a year after Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan. More than sixty countries didn't take part in the Moscow Summer Games to show their anger. Question: Which of the following is false?

For example, if the price of a gb of stereo system is 50, it can be found at shellact.com.","output":"(A). A good budget might start with allocating about 10 percent of your total expenditure towards the cartridge. Select the right type of cartridge for your tonearm's mount. To do this, you need to consider whether your turntable and tonearm are compatible with different types of cartridges. There are two primary cartridge types: moving magnet (MM) and moving coil (MC) cartridges. Moving magnet cartridges are the most common and usually more budget-friendly, whereas moving coil cartridges are known for their higher-quality sound performance but can be more expensive.  Also, ensure that the tonearm's mount - either standard (1/2 inch) or p-mount - is compatible with the selected cartridge. If you are unsure about compatibility, consult the manufacturer's specifications or seek expert help. Evaluate the cartridge's specifications, such as tracking force, output voltage, and frequency response. Tracking force is the force exerted by the stylus on the record groove and can impact how the record wears over time. Higher output voltage leads to a more significant signal, but it can also introduce more distortion. A wide frequency response ensures that the cartridge will accurately reproduce the full range of audio on the record.  Consider the cartridge's stylus type. Choose between elliptical and conical styli based on your preferences and the type of music you plan to listen to. Elliptical styli have a smaller contact area and can provide better high-frequency response, while conical styli are more robust and more forgiving of minor record defects. If you frequently play older records, a conical stylus may be preferable. Finally, be sure to read reviews and solicit advice from fellow audiophiles or experts in the field to help you make an informed decision. Online forums and local audio clubs can provide invaluable guidance in selecting the right phono cartridge for your needs and budget. Remember, it's essential to find a cartridge that fits well within your budget while providing a listening experience you can enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we'll first move the constant term on the right side of the equation to the left side by subtracting 5860 from both sides. -11564 - 5860 = -1584*p + 5860 - 5860 -17424 = -1584*p Step 2: Solve for p. Now, to find the value of p, we just need to divide both sides by the coefficient of p, which is -1584. -17424 / -1584 = (-1584*p) / -1584 11 = p So, the solution to the equation -11564 = -1584*p + 5860 is p = 11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: Granting bail pending appeals is rare but Mr Justice Burnett said Highway Agency worker's case was 'exceptional' Medical report suggests it could not be proved that it was definitely Golding who gave victim the disease. Herpes Viruses Association said his sentence was ‘outrageous’ and compared case to prosecuting children for ‘giving their friends chicken pox’","output":"Title: The Exceptional Case of Bail Granted for Highway Agency Worker Pending Appeals: A Medical and Legal Controversy Introduction: Bail pending appeal is a rarity in criminal cases; however, a recent ruling stands out as an exception to the norm. Mr. Justice Burnett found the case involving a Highway Agency worker to be exceptional based on medical reports and public outcry. This article explores the details of the case that led to this unusual ruling and discusses the concerns raised by the Herpes Viruses Association. Body: 1. The Exceptional Nature of the Case Bail during pending appeals is generally not granted, as it could potentially endanger public safety or undermine the justice system. In this case, Mr. Justice Burnett ruled it as exceptional for a number of reasons. Primarily, the medical report presented during the trial cast doubt on whether it was truly the Highway Agency worker, Golding, who transmitted the disease to the victim. 2. The Medical Report The focal point of this case has been the medical report provided, which suggests that it could not be proved definitively that Golding was responsible for transmitting the disease. The report highlights the possibility that the victim may have contracted the virus from another source, ultimately leading to the uncertainty that motivated Burnett's decision to grant bail. 3. The Herpes Viruses Association's Stance Adding to the complexity of the case, the Herpes Viruses Association has publicly condemned Golding's sentence as \\"outrageous.\\" They argue that prosecuting someone for transmitting herpes is akin to prosecuting children for giving their friends chickenpox. This sentiment casts doubt on the ethical implications of the ruling and raises questions about the fairness and consistency of practices in the criminal justice system. 4. Comparing to Similar Cases The case at hand raises important questions about criminal liability and the severity of punishment for the transmission of communicable diseases. Comparisons can be made to the more prevalent legal debates around HIV transmission, as well as debates surrounding the responsibility of individuals for spreading common illnesses like the flu. These questions force a reexamination of existing legal frameworks and may lead to changes in the way such cases are prosecuted. Conclusion: The exceptional granting of bail to the Highway Agency worker, Golding, highlights the myriad of concerns and complications that arise in cases involving the transmission of communicable diseases. With medical reports casting doubt on the veracity of the accusations and the Herpes Viruses Association questioning the ethical implications of such a ruling, this case serves as an important reminder of the challenges faced by the criminal justice system in navigating complex medical and ethical matters. As society continues to grapple with these issues, it remains to be seen whether cases like this one will lead to lasting changes in the legal landscape."},{"instruction":"Aubrey asked to borrow 5 from Cameron.

Review: The problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy.

Q: What gland secretes its products directly into the urethra through several small ducts   A: Select from the following. *pituitary; *adrenal; *thyroid; *prostate; Answer:","output":"The gland that secretes its products directly into the urethra through several small ducts is the prostate gland. The prostate gland is a small, walnut-sized gland in males that plays a crucial role in the male reproductive system. It is located just below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The urethra, which is the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body, passes through the center of the prostate gland. The primary function of the prostate gland is to produce and secrete a fluid called prostate fluid, which forms a significant portion of the seminal fluid (also known as semen). Seminal fluid provides a medium for sperm cells to swim and survive outside the body after ejaculation. Prostate fluid contains enzymes, proteins, and other substances that help protect and nourish the sperm, as well as facilitate sperm movement and survival. During ejaculation, the prostate gland contracts and releases the prostate fluid through several small ducts directly into the urethra. As the semen (a mixture of prostate fluid, seminal vesicle fluid, and sperm) travels through the urethra, it is expelled from the body during the process of ejaculation. In addition to secreting prostate fluid, the prostate gland also plays a role in the control of urine flow. It contains smooth muscle tissue that contracts and relaxes, regulating urine flow through the urethra. This function is crucial for maintaining urinary continence and ensuring proper disposal of waste products from the body. In summary, the prostate gland is an essential part of the male reproductive system. It secretes a vital component of seminal fluid and contributes to proper urinary function. The gland releases its products, primarily the prostate fluid, directly into the urethra through several ducts during the process of ejaculation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: At least 37 people have died and tens of thousands left homeless in the worst flooding to hit the Balkans since records began.      Three months worth of rain fell in three days last week in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia in a deluge described as catastrophic by government and emergency officials.      In Bosnia, a third of the country is under water, mostly in northern and eastern areas. A quarter of the four million population live in the affected areas.      At least 19 people have died in the flooding, which has also led to the displacement of landmines.      Heavy landslides have moved landmines and minefields from the 1992-95 war and warning signs at some nine thousands spots.      It is estimated that some 120,000 landmines remain in Bosnia. About 600 people have been killed by mines in the country since 1995.      Sarajevo Mine Action Centre official Sasa Obradovic said: “Besides the mines, a lot of weapons were thrown into the rivers, lying idle for almost 20 years.”      Croatia is also fighting to cope with the effects the flooding, with two confirmed deaths and earth walls being built along the Sava and Danube rivers.      In Serbia, 12 bodies were recovered in the flooded town of Obrenovac, about 20 miles South-west of the capital, Belgrade.      “What happened to us happens once in a thousand years, not hundred, but thousand,” Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said at a press conference yesterday.      “We have managed to avoid the worst catastrophe thanks to good organisation… The end is not close, but today is much better than yesterday.”      The countries stand along the Sava river. Its swollen tributaries made bridges disappear in minutes, while roads and railways were cut within hours. The tops of traffic signs were just visible yesterday under three or four metres of water.      The Sava is now threatening Belgrade, which lies at the confluence of the Sava and the Danube. River banks are being enforced and volunteers have stacked sandbags.      More than 24,000 people were evacuated from the hardest hit Serbian towns and are being accommodated in sports halls, hotels and schools, The EU and Russia have offered assistance.      “It doesn’t help that the sun shines today and that it’s warm outside,” said Natasa Marjanovic, 33, from Obrenovac. She and her two young children are staying at a sports hall in one of the Serbian capital’s suburbs.      “My heart is cold after what I’ve seen and what I’ve left behind” she added. ||||| Tens of thousands of people remain out of their homes in the Balkans, where torrential rain of an intensity not seen in over a century caused flooding and landslides that paralyzed much of the region, resulting in at least 30 deaths and loosening land mines left over from the Bosnian War.      Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      At least nine people died in the central Bosnian town of Doboj, but the death toll is expected to rise. The head of the Bosnian Serb police, Gojko Vasic, said the situation was particularly difficult there \\"because the floodwaters acted as a tsunami.\\"      \\"No one could have resisted,\\" he added during a news conference Saturday in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina.      Doboj was isolated from the rest of the world for three days. It is still without electricity and some of its neighborhoods can only be reached by boat or helicopter.      Serbia’s agricultural and power plant hub, Obrenovac, 20 miles southwest of the capital Belgrade, is the worst hit, with water levels reaching up to nearly 10 feet in the streets.      “The entire town is now being evacuated amid warnings of more flooding,” said Predrag Maric, head of Serbia’s emergency services.      Seven bodies were found in Obrenovac and the death toll there could rise. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic told reporters that \\"rescuers have started recovering dead bodies from flooded areas, but we will not make the number public before the complete withdrawal of the water.\\"      Inside the Slavija Hotel in downtown Belgrade, Aca Ilic described waking in the darkness to the sensation of moisture in his bed, then reaching for his phone on a bedside table to find it already lost in the water. He and his family were forced to evacuate from their home in Obrenovac.      “My wife and I swam with our 6-year-old son. I don’t know what happened to my grandmother, though. She did not want to leave her house,” said Ilic, 35.      In Bosnia, the landslides and floods could displace minefields left over from the Bosnian War, bringing mines and shells hidden on riverbeds to the surface.      According to Sasa Obradovic of Bosnia and Herzegovina's demining center, about 220,000 mines are still lying beneath on ground in the country’s territory.      “We are asking people not to panic if they see a shell lurking from the ground,” said Obradovic, who advised anyone who spots a mine to immediately call disposal experts.      Thousands of volunteers joined soldiers, police officers and firefighters in building flood barriers made of white sandbags in Belgrade and the western town of Sabac.      “I’m here for all the people in harm’s way,” said Jovan Nikolic, a 65-year-old retiree from Mladenovac who is spending a third day in the sandbag line.      The Sava River hit its highest-recorded level in Serbia, the army said, rising at a rate of slightly more than one inch per hour after three-months’ worth of rain fell on the region in just three days.      While the rain stopped Sunday, the Sava River wouldn't begin receding until Wednesday, said meteorologists.      In Serbia, 95,000 homes are without electricity as the country’s energy system neared its breaking point. City authorities in Belgrade switched off street lights to save electricity and avoid outages.      A fleet of helicopter crews worked to pluck people from rooftops and drop emergency supplies in dozens of towns in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia cut off by floods, landslides and damaged roads.      The floods have also caused lasting damage to livestock and agriculture.      “Our livestock is dead, our crops completely destroyed, our house is filled with water to the roof,” said Keta Mitrovic a 76-year-old farmer from Novo Selo, a village between hardest hit Obrenovac and Sabac.      “We have nothing left,” he said as his voice broke down. “No matter how old you are, you have not seen anything like this.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"At least 37 people have died, and tens of thousands have been left homeless due to the worst flooding to hit the Balkans since records began. Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia experienced three months worth of rain in just three days, leading to catastrophic floods and landslides. In Bosnia, a third of the country is under water, and 19 people have died due to the flooding. The heavy landslides have also displaced landmines and minefields from the 1992-95 war. Both Croatia and Serbia have also been severely affected by the flooding, with fatalities and evacuations. The swollen Sava river and its tributaries have caused extensive damage, disappearing bridges and cutting off roads and railways. The EU and Russia have offered assistance to the affected countries. The flooding has not only caused loss of human life and homes, but has also resulted in significant damage to livestock and agriculture."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Rated X ?

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Yes, when you analyze the meaning of both sentences, the logical conclusion is that if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is true as well. Let's break down the meaning of each sentence and explore why this conclusion is reached. Sentence 1: \\"But Pol Pot is irredeemable.\\" In this sentence, the term \\"irredeemable\\" describes a state or quality in which something or someone cannot be redeemed, improved, or made right in any sense or aspect. The subject of this sentence, Pol Pot, was a notorious Cambodian leader responsible for the Khmer Rouge regime and the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million people. The statement conveys the idea that Pol Pot is beyond any possible rectification or improvement due to the scale and horror of his actions. Sentence 2: \\"Pol Pot can never be redeemed.\\" This sentence also clearly asserts that Pol Pot's redemption is impossible. The word \\"never\\" emphasizes the absence of any conceivable situation or circumstance under which Pol Pot could be looked upon favorably or be considered as having made amends for his brutality. It restates the concept expressed in the first sentence by asserting the inability of Pol Pot to attain redemption, repair his tarnished image, or be absolved of his crimes. When comparing both sentences, we can observe that they primarily convey the same idea: Pol Pot is incapable of redemption due to the enormity of his crimes against humanity. The difference in the two sentences lies mainly in the structure and wording rather than the meaning. Nonetheless, the overall message communicated remains consistent. In conclusion, if the first sentence, \\"But Pol Pot is irredeemable,\\" is presumed to be true, then the second sentence, \\"Pol Pot can never be redeemed,\\" is also true. Both statements express the idea that Pol Pot, as an individual with a heinous record of genocide and cruelty, cannot be redeemed for his actions. Consequently, the truth of one sentence solidifies the truth of the other due to their shared underlying notion that Pol Pot's redemption is unattainable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Which entity is this text about? Villa told a number of conflicting stories about his early life, and his \\"early life remains shrouded in mystery.\\" According to most sources, he was born on 5 June 1878, and named Jose Doroteo Arango Arambula at birth. His father was a sharecropper named Agustin Arango, and his mother was Micaela Arambula. He grew up at the Rancho de la Coyotada, one of the largest haciendas in the state of Durango. Villa was a brilliant tactician on the battle field, which translated to political support. In 1913, local military commanders elected him provisional governor of the state of Chihuahua against the wishes of First Chief Carranza, who wished to name Manuel Chao instead.  As Governor of Chihuahua, Villa recruited more experienced generals, including Toribio Ortega, Porfirio Talamantes, and Calixto Contreras to his military staff and achieved more success than ever. Villa's secretary, Perez Rul, divided his army into two groups, one led by Ortega, Contreras, and Orestes Pereira and the other led by Talamantes and Contreras' former deputy, Severianco Ceniceros.  Villa's war tactics were studied by the United States Army and a contract with Hollywood was made whereby Hollywood would be allowed to film Villa's movements and 50% of Hollywood's profit would be paid to Villa to support the Revolution.  As governor of Chihuahua, Villa raised more money for a drive to the south against Huerta's Federal Army by various methods. He printed his own currency and decreed that it could be traded and accepted at par with gold Mexican pesos. He forced the wealthy to give loans to fund the revolutionary war machinery. He confiscated gold from several banks, and in the case of the Banco Minero he held a member of the bank's owning family, the wealthy Terrazas clan, as a hostage until the location of the bank's hidden gold reserves was revealed. He also appropriated land owned by the hacendados (owners of the haciendas) and redistributed it to the widows and family of dead revolutionaries.  Villa's political stature at that time was so high that banks in El Paso, Texas, accepted his paper pesos at face value. His generalship drew enough admiration from the U.S. military that he and Alvaro Obregon were invited to Fort Bliss to meet Brigadier General John J. Pershing. Returning to Mexico, Villa gathered supplies for a drive to the south.  With so many sources of money, Villa expanded and modernized his forces, purchasing draft animals, cavalry horses, arms, ammunition, mobile hospital facilities (railroad cars and horse ambulances staffed with Mexican and foreign volunteer doctors, known as Servicio sanitario), and other supplies, and rebuilt the railroad south of Chihuahua City. He also recruited fighters from Chihuahua and Durango and created a large army known as the Division del Norte (Division of the North), the most powerful and feared military unit in all of Mexico. The rebuilt railroad transported Villa's troops and artillery south, where he defeated the Federal Army forces in a series of battles at Gomez Palacio, Torreon, and eventually at the heart of Huerta's regime in Zacatecas.

The average crop per hive was down 72% compared to last year, with just 3.6kg (81b) of honey produced compared to an annual average, the annual honey survey by the BBKA revealed. The survey of 2,712 beekeepers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales found that 88% said this summer's bad weather caused the _ in honey yields. The bad weather made it difficult for bees to excrete ,which led to disease easily, and the bad weather also increased the risk of keeping bees for heavy rain caused the places which bees regularly visited to meet natural disasters. The bad weather also influenced the plants flowering which increased the cost of keeping bees. The BBKA issued a midsummer warning to feed bees if necessary to avoid dying from hunger. But in London, which recorded the worst results with just 2.5kg (5.61b)of honey harvested on average, beekeeping experts said that in addition to the bad weather there was a lack of food for bees in the city. Angela Woods, secretary of the London Beekeepers Association, said, \\"Rather than putting beehives on office roofs, we encourage companies in London that want to help to look at different ways of supporting bees and beekeepers.

Information:  - Pelit (\\"Games\\") is a Finnish video games magazine published in Helsinki, Finland.  - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores.  - Niko Nirvi ( born 1961 ) is a long - term major icon in the Finnish gaming world . He is well known for writing computer game reviews since the 1980s in MikroBitti , C = Lehti and the computer game yearbooks that were predecessors of the Pelit magazine . He has worked for the latter since its founding in 1992 , and holds a column in addition to making reviews and other reports . Nirvi began his career as a game reviewer in 1986 on pages of MikroBitti . He had made a bet with his friend that he could get his review published in the magazine . He sent two reviews , Zoids and Uridium and the former was published ( they already had one Uridium review ) . Nirvi wrote reviews and a regular column about new games for Mikrobitti and became the \`\` game editor '' of the magazine . He also wrote reviews for C = Lehti . When Pelit , that concentrated solely on gaming , was founded by the same publisher , Nirvi joined its ranks as an editor , and has written a regular column for each issue . Trademarks of his are signing with \`\` Nnirvi '' or a variation , and never showing his face in the magazine . Photos of him are always either covered or edited in a way that the face is unrecognizable . His personal picture in his articles is usually a gaming or movie character whose face is blurred ( for example Master Chief ) while the rest of the crew 's articles feature their real faces . Wallu 's drawings of Nirvi depict him as a bearded man with Spock 's Vulcan ears . According to Nirvi , his avoidance of publicity started in 1988 , when a MikroBitti reader asked for a photograph of him , which Nirvi instantly declined , and this avoidance has strengthened ever since . Nirvi 's style is typically humorous , and sometimes unorthodox . Some of Nirvi 's most unconventional reviews were published in C = Lehti . The review of Domark 's motorboat game Hydra was written as a nursery rhyme from the beginning to the end . The review of Battle Island contained just two words : '' Paska Commando - klooni . \`\` ( '' shitty Commando clone \`\` ) .  - A department store or magazine is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as \\"departments\\".

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Options are: (a). no (b). yes","output":"(a). no The correct answer is \\"no\\" because the passage does not mention basketball as an activity enjoyed by tourists in the Algarve.

Here is a question about this article: The hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century. Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded \\"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle . . acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . . directing the several movements\\". About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.

Question: Process:  - Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant - Is trapped - Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment - The plant forms glucose - The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oxygen is created happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that more oxygen is being created. If we assume that this results in less sugar (glucose) and oxygen being produced overall, we can analyze the potential direct and indirect effects on the photosynthesis process. Direct effect: An increase in oxygen production could lead to a higher concentration of oxygen in the plant's immediate environment. This might lead to a process called photorespiration, during which the plant consumes more oxygen and produces less glucose. Photorespiration occurs when the enzyme RuBisCO binds with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, reducing the plant's efficiency in producing glucose. Indirect effect: An increase in oxygen levels could lead to a change in the plant's environment, possibly affecting other organisms and processes that the plant relies on. For example, the increased oxygen levels could affect the plant's relationship with microbes or other organisms that help with nutrient absorption. If these relationships are disrupted, it might lead to a decrease in the overall production of glucose by the plant. Additionally, if more oxygen is being produced, it might also mean that more carbon dioxide is being consumed. This could lead to a decrease in the availability of carbon dioxide, which is a necessary component for the photosynthesis process. A decrease in the levels of carbon dioxide would result in a decrease in glucose production as well. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of more oxygen being created could have both direct and indirect effects on the photosynthesis process, potentially leading to less sugar and oxygen being produced."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What was the second vaccine produced Context: Early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period, primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases. In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.","output":"The second vaccine produced was the first diphtheria vaccine, which was created in 1914."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Snowflakes! You can catch them on your tongue   or use them to make a perfect snowball. But have you ever thought about taking pictures of them? Ken Libbrecht did. He is a physics professor from California. Although the weather in California is usually warm and sunny, Ken's hobby is taking pictures of snowflakes. He travels to cold areas like Alaska and Canada to find snowstorms and take pictures of the snowflakes. \\"They are often beautiful, and every snowfall brings new surprises,\\" says Ken. Ken takes pictures of snowflakes with a high-quality digital camera. He uses a microscope   to make the tiny snowflakes larger. To get the best images, Ken built a special photo-microscope just for snowflakes. He collects flakes by letting them fall onto a piece of foam board  . The pictures must be taken outdoors, so Ken wears lots of clothes to stay warm. But his fingers often get cold, because it's difficult for him to take pictures of a tiny snowflake with gloves. Each snowflake has shapes and patterns   that make it as unique   as a person's fingerprint. The hobby of snowflake photography is also unique. Next time a snowstorm blows through your town, take a closer look at the flakes before you gather them into a snowball. See if you can notice their unique patterns. Millions of snowflakes are waiting for you! ,. Question: Why do Ken's fingers often get cold? Options: A: Because he doesn't wear enough clothes. B: Because he doesn't wear gloves.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose resting or sleeping happens, how will it affect less oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Resting or sleeping does have an indirect effect on the process of oxygen absorption by small blood vessels. During these states, the body's overall metabolic rate is reduced, and therefore, the body requires less oxygen to function. As a result, breathing rate typically decreases, resulting in less frequent inhales and exhales. However, although the quantity of oxygen absorbed by the small blood vessels may decrease, the efficiency of oxygen exchange at the alveoli level is maintained. During rest or sleep, the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles can work more efficiently, allowing sufficient oxygenation of the blood even with reduced intake. In summary, resting or sleeping may have an indirect effect on the overall oxygen absorption process by reducing the demand for oxygen and breathing rate, but it does not significantly impair the effectiveness of oxygen exchange between the alveoli and small blood vessels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:This article: When the entire British royal family is killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace, Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park. The next day, Miranda returns the money to Graves, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. In order to preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose team locates a living heir?, what is it ?

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. The bill includes 1,400 payments, an extension of jobless benefits, and a child tax credit that is expect to lift millions out of poverty. Mr Biden said the relief package will rebuild \\"the backbone of this country\\". The spending bill, one of the largest in US history, passed Congress without a single Republican supporter. Mr Biden is due to give a primetime address later on Thursday to tout the bill's provisions. He and other Democrats will also hold a signing ceremony at the White House on Friday. This sixth Covid-19 relief bill is a major legislative win for Mr Biden. The package has been broadly popular among Americans. A March Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of US adults surveyed expressed support for the bill, including 41% of Republicans. Unemployment skyrocketed over the last year, with a current rate of 6.2%, according to the US Labor Department. Mr Biden had originally planned the bill signing for Friday, but it was pushed up in his schedule \\"because Congress enroled the bill more quickly than we anticipated,\\" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a tweet. Joe Biden was originally expected to sign the ambitiously named \\"American Recovery Plan Act\\" at the White House on Friday. Instead the final step in enacting the president's first significant piece of legislation was moved up to Thursday afternoon. An official ceremony is still planned for Friday, but the scheduling change reveals an administration anxious to get busy selling the American people on the benefits of this massive and multifaceted piece of government spending. This - and Biden's address to the nation Thursday night - are the opening gun of a two-week public-relations blitz, including presidential travel, to highlight the legislation. It shouldn't be too hard a sell, as opinion polls indicate widespread support for the law even among Republican voters. What Biden and the Democrats don't want is a repeat of the 2009 Great Recession relief bill passed under President Barack Obama. Many in the party believe that Democrats did not claim enough credit for the law's benefits - and that voters had forgotten about their efforts when they cast their ballots in the 2010 congressional mid-term elections (and roundly voted Democrats out of office). Biden, as vice-president, had a front-row seat for that debacle. His actions as president suggest he hasn't forgotten it. What's in the bill? The act includes one-off direct payments worth 1,400 to be sent off to most Americans. It extends weekly jobless benefit payments of 300 until September. It also allocates 350bn to state and local governments, some 130bn to school reopening, 49bn for expanded Covid-19 testing and research, as well as 14bn for vaccine distribution. A proposal to raise the national minimum wage from 7.25 to 15 per hour became a sticking point in the Senate and did not make it into the final version of the bill. When will stimulus money be deposited? White House officials say that direct payments, the third payments of the pandemic, will begin before the end of March. Previous cheques were sent out by tax officials within one to two weeks of the bills' passage. Individuals earning up to 75,000 will receive a 1,400 payment. Tax officials at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) use tax statements to determine the exact size of each person's payment. For that reason they have urged Americans to quickly file their tax returns, which are due 15 April. Stimulus cheques sent out by Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, included the former president's personal signature. But Mrs Psaki said Mr Biden's signature will not be on these payments. What does the child tax credit do? Currently, American couples are able to apply for a 2,000 per child under the Child Tax Credit, a 24-year old government programme. This law increases the tax break to 3,000 for every child age 6 to 17. Children under the age of 6 will receive a 3,600 benefit. More than 4 million children - more than half of the total - could be lifted out of poverty, according to analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It also extends access to lower income families, even those that pay nothing in taxes, by making the credit refundable. The programme is temporary, and will expire after one year. What did Biden say? Before signing the bill in the White House Oval Office, Mr Biden said the bill is about \\"rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving people in this nation, working people, middle class folks, the people that built the country a fighting chance. \\"That's what the essence of it is.\\" He promised that he would have \\"a lot more to say about that tonight and the next couple of days\\". Mr Biden will deliver his first primetime address to the American public on Thursday night. The speech comes on the 50th day of his presidency. It will be the third time this year that he has marked a moment in the coronavirus pandemic, which has left more than 529,000 people dead and over 29 million infected. Previewing his remarks on Wednesday, Mr Biden said he would be laying out \\"the next phase,\\" of the US Covid-response. \\"There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year. But we cannot let our guard down now or assume the victory is inevitable,\\" he said. \\"Together, we're going get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future.\\" On Thursday, the White House announced that Mr Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris will travel to Atlanta, Georgia next Friday as part of the \\"Help is Here tour to amplify the American Rescue Plan\\". Output:","output":"President Joe Biden signs a 1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, including 1,400 payments, jobless benefits extension, and a child tax credit to lift millions out of poverty, marking a major legislative win early in his presidency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: As others have mentioned, this movie is similar to THE FLY (both versions) and the lesser known sci-fi flick ALTERED STATES. The big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it. METAMORPHOSIS did not have these advantages. METAMORPHOSIS is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the roles. The story follows scientist Dr. Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock), an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death. When the university he works for threatens to cut funding, he decides to inject the anti-aging serum into himself. As a result, Dr. Houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard. And oh yes, watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy. It really is so bad that it's good. Some of the lines are classic: \\"What WAS it?\\" \\"A nightmare...from the past!\\" Many of the reviews that I've read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are. I'm just going to go ahead and spoil it: the good doctor goes from being a shuffling half-man, half-lizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected Godzilla costume, when the police finally gun him down. In the final scene, some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die, and the movie's heroine, Sally Donnelly (Catherine Baranov) evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of Dr. Houseman. The camera then gives us a close-up of the lizard's face; this is, I assume, the director's way of showing us that the lizard is EVIL. Yes, it is goofy, but I fell over laughing so I can't complain. I watched this movie because it was a part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack that I purchased. I'm sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing, as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on DVD.

Article: Hollyhocks come in a seemingly endless assortment of shades of white, yellow, pink, maroon and red flowers, which grow on 6 to 9 foot (1.8 to 2.7 m) stalks.  Hollyhocks will reseed themselves for subsequent growing years. You can also harvest seeds from plants in the fall. Some hollyhock varieties will generally grow a bit shorter or taller, so consider your space needs and height preferences as well. If you live in an area with cold winters, consider starting hollyhock seeds indoors in the fall. Germinate the seeds in October or November and allow them to grow for a while and experience a winter. This may trick the flowers into blooming the following spring.  If you live in a warmer climate, you may be able to plant the seeds outdoors in the fall and achieve the same results. In the U.S., hollyhocks can manage in USDA hardiness zones 3-8 (see http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/). In cooler zones (e.g., 3), you’ll definitely want to start indoors — either the previous fall or early in the spring. In warmer zones (e.g., 8), you can sow seeds outdoors in the fall or spring. Hollyhock seeds are large, have a high germination rate, and come few to a package, so it is best to plant each seed individually. Put each seed 0.25 to 0.5 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) below the soil.  Any small plant container will do, but plastic “peat pots” filled with perlite, vermiculite, and peat moss are ideal for this. Place the trays near a window where they'll receive ample sunlight. Water the soil as needed to keep it moist. Hollyhock seeds usually germinate in 1 to 2 weeks. You only need to do this if you are growing the plants indoors over the winter. If you’re just starting early in the spring, you can go straight from the peat pots to outdoors. Keep the pots in a sunny spot indoors, and water them regularly. What is a summary?","output":"Hollyhocks are beautiful flowering plants that come in various colors and can grow on stalks up to 9 feet tall. They can reseed themselves and grow in USDA hardiness zones 3-8. For those living in cold climates, it is recommended to start the seeds indoors in the fall, while in warmer climates, seeds can be sown outdoors in the fall or spring. Hollyhock seeds have a high germination rate and should be planted individually in small containers with a mix of perlite, vermiculite, and peat moss.

What happens next in this paragraph? How to file taxes for a deceased person  Collect the person's income reporting forms.  Gather the income reporting forms that have been mailed to the deceased person, called the decedent. This includes w-2s , 1099s and interest statements.","output":"After you have collected the income reporting forms for the deceased person, the next steps in the process of filing taxes for a deceased person involve the following: 1. Determine the need to file a tax return: Evaluate if it's necessary to file a tax return for the decedent's final tax year. To do this, compare the decedent's gross income with the filing requirements outlined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States or the relevant tax authority in the country you are in. Additionally, check if any other circumstances such as self-employment income, capital gains, or other financial events during the year may require filing a tax return. 2. Obtain a copy of the tax return form: In the United States, this is the IRS Form 1040 for individual income tax returns or the corresponding form in your country. Be sure to use the version of the form for the year in which the decedent passed away. 3. Request permission to file as a fiduciary: In some cases, you may need to apply for authorization to manage the decedent's tax affairs and file the return on their behalf. Typically, this role is designated to the executor of the estate or another authorized individual. You would need to file IRS Form 56 (Notice Concerning Fiduciary Relationship) in the United States or the corresponding form with the appropriate tax authority. 4. Apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN): This number will allow you to identify the decedent's estate during the tax filing process. In the United States, you can apply for an EIN using the IRS Form SS-4 or through the IRS website. 5. Report the decedent's income: Use the collected income reporting forms (W-2s, 1099s, and interest statements) to fill out the relevant sections of the tax return form. Include all pertinent information about the decedent's income from wages, salaries, self-employment, investments, and any other sources. 6. Deduct allowable expenses: Document any deductions the decedent might be entitled to, such as medical expenses, charitable contributions, and business expenses. Make sure to provide necessary supporting documentation for these deductions as required by your tax authority. 7. Calculate the decedent's tax liability: Based on the reported income and deductions, determine the amount of tax the decedent is liable for in their final tax year. 8. Report any tax payments already made: If the deceased person made estimated tax payments or had taxes withheld from their wages, include this information on the tax return to ensure proper credit. 9. Sign and submit the tax return: As the appointed fiduciary or executor, sign the tax return on behalf of the deceased person. This signature should be signed, followed by the word \\"deceased\\" and the decedent's name, date of death, and your title (such as executor or personal representative). Submit the completed tax return along with any required supporting documents and payment for outstanding tax liability to the appropriate tax authority. 10. File any additional tax returns as needed: Depending on the circumstances, you may need to file additional tax returns for the decedent, such as an estate tax return, gift tax return, or a trust tax return. Consult with a tax professional to determine if these returns are required and how to properly file them. Once you have completed these steps, you will have successfully fulfilled your responsibilities in filing taxes for the deceased person. As a fiduciary, it is essential to continue monitoring the decedent's tax affairs until all responsibilities have been addressed, and any outstanding tax liabilities or refunds have been resolved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Probability can only be calculated when the event whose probability you’re calculating either happens or doesn’t happen. The event and its opposite both cannot occur at the same time. Rolling a 5 on a die, a certain horse winning a race, are examples of mutually exclusive events. Either a 5 is rolled or it isn’t; either the horse wins or it doesn’t. Let’s say you're trying to find the likelihood of rolling a 3 on a 6-sided die. “Rolling a 3” is the event, and since we know that a 6-sided die can land any one of 6 numbers, the number of outcomes is 6. So, we know that in this case, there are 6 possible events and 1 outcome whose probability we’re interested in calculating. Here are 2 more examples to help you get oriented:   Example 1: What is the likelihood of choosing a day that falls on the weekend when randomly picking a day of the week? \\"Choosing a day that falls on the weekend\\" is our event, and the number of outcomes is the total number of days in a week: 7.  Example 2: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles and 11 white marbles. If a marble is drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that this marble is red? \\"Choosing a red marble\\" is our event, and the number of outcomes is the total number of marbles in the jar, 20. This will give us the probability of a single event occurring. In the case of rolling a 3 on a die, the number of events is 1 (there’s only a single 3 on each die), and the number of outcomes is 6. You can also express this relationship as 1 ÷ 6, 1/6, 0.166, or 16.6%. Here's how you find the probability of our remaining examples:   Example 1: What is the likelihood of choosing a day that falls on the weekend when randomly picking a day of the week? The number of events is 2 (since 2 days out of the week are weekends), and the number of outcomes is 7. The probability is 2 ÷ 7 = 2/7. You could also express this as 0.285 or 28.5%.  Example 2: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles and 11 white marbles. If a marble is drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that this marble is red? The number of events is 5 (since there are 5 red marbles), and the number of outcomes is 20. The probability is 5 ÷ 20 = 1/4. You could also express this as 0.25 or 25%. The likelihood of all possible events needs to add up to 1 or to 100%. If the likelihood of all possible events doesn't add up to 100%, you've most likely made a mistake because you've left out a possible event. Recheck your math to make sure you’re not omitting any possible outcomes. For example, the likelihood of rolling a 3 on a 6-sided die is 1/6. But the probability of rolling all five other numbers on a die is also 1/6. 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 6/6 , which = 100%. This just means that there is no chance of an event happening, and occurs anytime you deal with an event that simply cannot happen. While calculating a 0 probability is not likely, it’s not impossible either. For example, if you were to calculate the probability of the Easter holiday falling on a Monday in the year 2020, the probability would be 0 because Easter is always on a Sunday.","output":"Probability is all about finding how likely something is going to happen. Think of it like trying to guess which toy you'll get in a surprise box. If there are different toys, some things can happen and some things cannot, but we need to know the chances. Let's pretend the surprise box has 6 toys: one of them is a toy number 3, and there are 7 days in a week, two of them are weekends. Like in another pretend game where we have 20 marbles, 5 are red, and we want to know how likely it is to pick a red one.  We can find the chances by counting how many ways the thing can happen and how many total possibilities there are. In our games, we figured out there is a 1 in 6 chance to get the toy number 3, a 2 in 7 chance to pick a weekend day, and a 1 in 4 (or 5 in 20) chance to pick a red marble. This helps us know the likelihood of something happening! Remember, all the possibilities should add up to 100%, like in our toy game (each toy has a chance of 1/6, and when you count all of the chances, it is 100%). Sometimes, the chance of something happening can be 0%, if it just cannot happen, like Easter falling on a Monday in 2020 because Easter is always on a Sunday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too.

The basin has been named \\"Rachmaninoff\\". \\"With the first flyby, we found evidence of volcanism all over the planet, which was pretty exciting,\\" said Dr Louise Prockter, from Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, who led the research. \\"But now we've done some age dating on this particular impact basin; it's one of the youngest on the planet and there are signs of volcanic activity [in it] that happened after the basin formed.\\" The age of this volcanic activity can be estimated only very approximately by examining the texture of the surface; the more overlaid impact craters, the older the surface structures are estimated to be. Dr Prockter said: \\"This volcano is about two billion years younger than we would have expected. And it's possible that when Messenger gets into orbit, we'll find younger areas of volcanism. \\"We want to know: was this a last gasp? Or is this more common than we thought?\\" Dr David Rothery, an Earth scientist from the UK's Open University in Milton Keynes, said the findings could reveal clues about the evolution of our own planet, and even of those outside our Solar System. He told BBC News: \\"Mercury is very close to the Sun, and when we're looking for planets around other stars - exoplanets - those that are closest to their stars are the easiest to see. \\"So similar processes to those on Mercury might occur on exoplanets.\\" Dr Prockter explained that, because Mercury is such a small planet, scientists would have expected it to \\"kick out\\" all of its heat very early on in its life. The surface area of the planet is relatively large in relation to its volume, so all the heat generated underneath the surface should have escaped quickly. Dr Rothery said: \\"We want to know what has kept Mercury going; it's clearly a much more dynamic planet that we expected.\\" In the same issue of Science, James Slavin, a space physicist at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and colleagues, described evidence of very intense \\"magnetic substorms\\" on Mercury. These occur on other planets, including Earth, bceause of the planet's magnetic field. This protects our planet from the hot, charged gas particles that flow away from the Sun as a \\"solar wind\\". When the solar wind reaches the Earth it is deflected by the field. As a result, Dr Slavin explained, \\"part of the Earth's magnetic field gets pulled downstream by the solar wind to form a very long comet-like magnetic tail\\". When conditions are just right, the solar wind can sometimes \\"load\\" that tail with many more lines of magnetic force to a point where it becomes unstable. At Earth this loading goes on for about an hour before the tail's magnetic lines suddenly \\"break-off\\" - a portion return to Earth, while the rest are carried off by the solar wind. \\"The energy given up during this unloading drives the heating and acceleration of charged particles in the tail,\\" explained Dr Slavin. \\"This process produces the majestic auroras that can be seen in the high latitudes, as some of the charged particles rain down into the upper atmosphere.\\" The combined loading and unloading process is referred to as a magnetospheric substorm - it is a form of space weather that can even affect satellite communications. Messenger flew through Mercury's magnetic tail in September 2009. \\"During this third flyby, over a period of 30 minutes, we saw its magnetic tail load, and then - boom - it unloaded, a total of four times,\\" said Dr Slavin. \\"But these magnetospheric substorms at Mercury are a great surprise in that they last only about two minutes - 30 times quicker than at Earth.\\" Messenger's principal investigator Sean Solomon, of Carnegie's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in the US, said: \\"Every time we've encountered Mercury, we've discovered new phenomena. \\"Once Messenger has been safely inserted into orbit about Mercury next March, we'll be in for a terrific show.\\" Dr Prockter said: \\"The Solar System is like this giant laboratory where Earth is the control, and all the planets are different. \\"Missions like this help us to understand how the whole Solar System evolved.\\"","output":"Scientists found out that Mercury, a small planet close to the Sun, had volcanoes that were active a long time ago. They learned this from a spacecraft called Messenger that flew close to Mercury. This discovery helps scientists learn more about how planets like Mercury, and even Earth, were formed and changed over time. When Messenger gets into orbit around Mercury, they might find more proof of volcanic activity. This can also help them study planets outside our Solar System that are close to their stars, like Mercury is close to the Sun."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea human rights advocates are considering more practical ways to reform the repressive practices of the Kim Jong Un government, as denuclearization talks continue to end the country’s economic and diplomatic isolation. Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about Trump? Options:  A.

Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past.

Article: Last week, my granddaughter started kindergarten, and I wished her every success. But part of me didn't. I actually wanted her to fail in some ways because I believe that failure can be good for our learning process. Success is proving that you can do something that you already know you can do, or doing something correctly the first time, which can often be a problematic   victory. First-time success is usually a fluke  . First-time failure, by contrast, is expected to be the natural order of things. Failure is how we learn. In Africa they describe a good cook as \\"She who has broken many pots.\\" If you've spent enough time in the kitchen to have broken a lot of pots, probably you know a fair amount about cooking. I once had dinner with a group of cooks, and they spent time comparing knife wounds and burn scars. They knew how much credibility   their failures gave them. I earn my living by writing a daily newspaper column. Each week I am aware that one column I write is going to be the worst column. I try my best every day. I have learned to cherish that column. A successful column usually means that I am discussing my familiar topic, writing in a style I am used to or saying the same things as anyone else but in a fancy way. My younger daughter is a trapeze artist. She spent three years putting together a show, and she did it successfully for years. There was no reason for her to change it but she did anyway. She said she was no longer learning anything new and she was bored. And if she was bored, there was no point in subjecting (......) her body to all that stress. She risked failure and great public embarrassment in order to feed her soul. My granddaughter is a perfectionist. She will feel her failures, and I will want to comfort her. But I will also, I hope, remind her of what she learned, and how she can do better next time. I hope I can tell her, though, that it's not the end of the world. Indeed, with luck, it is the beginning. Question: The author develops the article mainly by   _  .

Fabrice Moscheni, of the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP), which drew up the measure, said \\"people we welcome in Switzerland should respect the rules of this country\\". But opponents said it was another example of increasing xenophobia. The SVP was behind last year's referendum that imposed a ban on the building of Islamic minarets. That decision was condemned by human rights groups and foreign governments. The SVP says immigrants to Switzerland are disproportionately responsible for crime. It points to the fact that more than 60% of prison inmates do not have Swiss nationality. But opponents say the measures go too far. The children of immigrants do not automatically get Swiss citizenship, so the rule would mean sending some people who were born and brought up in Switzerland to countries they know nothing of. Convicts would serve their sentence in Switzerland first and then be deported without appeal. The Swiss government believes mandatory deportation could violate Switzerland's obligations under international law not to send people to countries that practise torture or execution. It advised voters to reject the proposal, and it put forward an alternative system which would allow deportation for certain crimes, but which would assess cases individually. That was defeated. The SVP has been accused of using racist posters that depict certain ethnic groups as criminal. The Swiss political analyst Georg Lutz says the SVP's wider strategy is to capitalise on Swiss worries that the foreign population is too big. \\"This vote is not about some complex legal issues about how to deal with certain types of criminal foreigners,\\" he says. \\"What most people will want to do in this vote is make a statement against foreigners, and that is the central motivation.\\" A second referendum, which asked the Swiss to approve a minimum tax rate of 22% for people earning more than 250,000 francs (Â£160,000; 190,000 euros), was rejected. The Socialist Party said it would be more just, but the government and centre-right parties said it would harm the economy by making the country less appealing to foreign businessmen.","output":"A little more than half of the people in Switzerland agreed that people who commit crimes, big or small, should be sent out of the country. A group called SVP made this idea, and they believe that a lot of crimes are done by people who come from other countries. But, some people think this is not fair, because it can force kids who have always lived in Switzerland to leave. The Swiss government is also worried about sending people to countries that might hurt or punish them too much. The SVP is also trying to make the Swiss people worry about there being too many people from other countries living there. In another vote, people decided not to put a special tax on people who earn a lot of money."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Grammatical structure: \\"I insist on seeing through all the students who had started out the term in my class.\\" The sentence structure consists of a main clause (\\"I insist on seeing through all the students\\") and a relative clause (\\"who had started out the term in my class\\"). The use of the past perfect tense (\\"had started\\") may be unnecessary in this context, as the simple past tense (\\"who started\\") could suffice to convey the meaning. However, the past perfect tense can also work given some more context. 2. Clarity of meaning: The phrase \\"seeing through\\" may cause confusion regarding what the speaker intends to achieve with the students. If the intended meaning is to ensure the success of all students who started out the term in the speaker's class, then using a phrase such as \\"guiding to completion\\" or \\"ensuring the success of\\" might be clearer. 3. Word choice: The choice of words generally fits the context, but as mentioned earlier, the phrase \\"seeing through\\" can be ambiguous. Replacing it with clearer language would enhance the linguistic integrity of the sentence. Taking all these factors into consideration, the linguistic integrity of the sentence can be considered moderate. The grammatical structure is mostly sound, but there is room to improve clarity of meaning and word choice to ensure the reader fully understands the speaker's intention."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: have to say, express yourself, not to forget, speak loudly, move fingers  Why is \\"not to forget\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Not to forget\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it captures one of the fundamental motivations and benefits behind the practice of writing things down. Writing serves as a tool for information storage and retrieval, helping humans to preserve and recall crucial knowledge, experiences, and ideas. This function is particularly important given the limitations of human memory and the vast amount of information individuals encounter throughout their lives. There are several reasons why \\"not to forget\\" makes sense as a common-sense answer to why people write things down: 1. Memory limitation: Human memory is fallible and tends to weaken over time. By writing things down, people effectively create external storage for their thoughts and experiences, ensuring that the information does not get lost as their memories fade. 2. Cognitive offloading: Writing things down can free up mental resources by offloading some cognitive burden onto an external medium. This can help people to maintain focus on a specific task or idea, reducing the likelihood of forgetting important details. 3. Organization: Writing can serve as a means to structure and organize thoughts, which can make it easier to remember key information and ideas. Being able to visually review and rearrange written material enables more effective thinking, planning, and processing. 4. Clarity: Writing can provide a clearer and more concrete representation of complex thoughts or abstract ideas than can be achieved through verbal communication or mental recollection alone. Writing things down can solidify mental connections, making it easier to remember and share information. 5. Reinforcement: The process of writing can help reinforce memory by stimulating multiple neural pathways associated with learning and memory consolidation. This is because writing involves both the generation and encoding of information, which strengthens the neural connections associated with the written content. 6. Retrieval cues: In addition to preserving information, written records can act as retrieval cues that help trigger associated memories. People often find that reviewing their written notes or journals enables them to recall information that might otherwise have been forgotten. 7. Promotes understanding: Writing can enhance a person's understanding of the information they're processing, which in turn supports long-term retention. By articulating their thoughts in writing, people are forced to critically analyze and synthesize the material, reinforcing their memory of it. In summary, \\"not to forget\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it reflects the inherent value and practical benefits of writing as a tool for information preservation and memory enhancement. By writing things down, individuals can compensate for the limitations of their memory, promote clearer thinking and organization, and reinforce their understanding of the subject matter—ultimately improving their ability to recall the information in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, let's simplify the equation. We have three terms with the letter \\"m\\" on the right side: -147 * m - 5 * m - 5153 Let's combine the terms with \\"m\\": -147 * m - 5 * m = (-147 - 5) * m = -152 * m Now our equation looks like this: 62 * m + 21169 = -152 * m - 5153 Next, let's move the -152 * m from the right to the left side. To do this, we'll add 152 * m to both sides: 62 * m + 152 * m + 21169 = -5153 Now let's combine the \\"m\\" terms on the left side: (62 + 152) * m + 21169 = -5153 That gives us: 214 * m + 21169 = -5153 Now, we need to get rid of the \\"+ 21169\\" on the left side. We'll do this by subtracting 21169 from both sides: 214 * m = -5153 - 21169 That gives us: 214 * m = -26322 Finally, we need to find the value of m. Since 214 * m = -26322, we can find m by dividing both sides by 214: m = -26322 ÷ 214 When you do that calculation, you'll get: m = -123 So there you have it, m is equal to -123!

Select from: [a]. Drink a cup of pickle juice.. [b]. Drink a cup of grape juice..","output":"To determine which solution is better for curing hiccups, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Research the causes of hiccups. Hiccups are involuntary contractions of the diaphragm, often caused by irritation of the diaphragm muscles or the nerves that control them. Common triggers include eating too quickly, consuming carbonated beverages, or swallowing air. Step 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of each option. Option [a]: Drinking a cup of pickle juice is believed to cure hiccups because the strong, sour flavor stimulates the nerves in the mouth and throat, which can help disrupt the hiccup reflex. The vinegar in the pickle juice might also help relax the diaphragm. Option [b]: Drinking a cup of grape juice does not have any proven or suspected effects on hiccups. It is a delicious and healthy drink, but it doesn't seem to have a direct impact on curing hiccups. Step 3: Compare the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option. Option [a]: Drinking pickle juice has a clear potential benefit for curing hiccups, and it is a commonly-used anecdotal remedy. However, its strong taste and high sodium content may not be suitable for everyone, especially people on a low-sodium diet or with certain health conditions. Option [b]: Drinking grape juice does not have any specific benefits for curing hiccups but does not pose risks or downsides for most people, aside from possible sugar content for those watching their sugar intake. Conclusion: Given that the goal is to cure hiccups, the better solution is [a] Drink a cup of pickle juice. Its potential benefits for hiccups outweigh the lack of any known benefits for grape juice. However, it is important to consider individual preferences and medical conditions before trying this remedy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What political correspondent voluntarily removed himself from the UK Strictly Come Dancing celebrity talent show for fear of undersevedly winning it?","output":"In 2005, political correspondent John Sergeant voluntarily removed himself from the UK Strictly Come Dancing celebrity talent show for fear of undeservingly winning it. Sergeant, a British television journalist, and former BBC political correspondent, decided to participate in the sixth edition of the popular and competitive show, partnered with professional dancer Kristina Rihanoff. Throughout the competition, Sergeant attracted much media attention and became known for his consistently low scores given by the show's judges. Despite these low scores, he had a strong fan following, and the public votes kept him in the running, in some cases leading to better dancers being eliminated. This prompted even more media coverage, and Sergeant's continued presence in the competition became a major talking point. At the time, critics and some viewers suggested that he was only advancing in the show out of sympathy and that it would be unfair were a more talented dancer to lose the competition because of this factor. As a result, in November 2008, during week 10 of the show, John Sergeant voluntarily decided to leave Strictly Come Dancing. He cited concerns about undeservedly winning the competition and possibly upsetting the integrity of the show. At a press conference, he said that it had become a \\"joke too far,\\" referring to his participation in the competition. Sergeant's withdrawal was met with mixed reactions, with some praising him for preserving the integrity of the competition, while others lamented the loss of his entertaining presence on the show.

Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person observed a loss in genetic diversity?  Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it's clear that Bobby, who studied a small, isolated group of mammals, observed a loss in genetic diversity. Here is the step-by-step justification for this answer: 1. The paragraph states that declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity. 2. Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. This indicates that the population he studied is likely smaller in size compared to Will's population. 3. Smaller population size could lead to a reduced gene pool, increased genetic drift, and inbreeding depression. 4. Bobby's population would have a higher chance of stochastic events causing deleterious alleles to become fixed (due to genetic drift). 5. The example provided in the paragraph about the Florida panther supports the idea that smaller population size can suffer from reduced genetic diversity and inbreeding depression. Therefore, Bobby observed a loss in genetic diversity in his study of the smaller, isolated group of mammals."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: Who shots Maddox?

Maxwell Stuart Alvey has admitted to profiting from his car mileage scam. A bogus car dealer made thousands of pounds by wiping the mileage off cars before selling them on to unassuming drivers. Maxwell Stuart Alvey, from Arnold, Nottinghamshire, profited in excess of £100,000 in just 10 months after buying a fleet of vans at auction then tampering with their mileage. People who bought the vans complained to Trading Standards after noticing there was an unusual amount of wear and tear for their mileage. In one case he reduced the mileage of a Mercedes Sprinter by more than 275,000miles from 364,370 to just 89,000. When cross-referenced with auction house records with AutoTrader records it was discovered he had taken more than 200,000 miles off another Mercedes Sprinter van before selling it to a plumber in Derby. Pegasus Plumbing Services forked out £6,319 for the vehicle which Alvey had bought for £4,423 at auction just weeks earlier. Mark Denton, contracts manager for. Pegasus, bought the 55-registration. Mercedes from Alvey who claimed it had clocked a mere 76,000 miles when in fact it had done 276,000. Mr Denton said: 'I was looking for a. larger van and when I saw the Mercedes it looked ideal. It was five. years old when we bought it, so the 76,000 miles quoted in the advert. was reasonable for a commercial vehicle. 'The price was a little bit lower. than the dealer prices I’d seen for the same model but because I thought. I was buying privately I wasn’t suspicious. 'When I went to see the van it looked. in good condition and Mr Alvey seemed a genuine character. He told us. the vans he sold were all supplied by the same company. 'We had the van HPI-checked - which it passed - and went ahead and bought it.' Angus will be sentenced today at Nottingham crown court for the series of offences. After altering the milometer readings. and tidying the bodywork, Alvey typically advertised the vans at between. £1,000 and £2,000 more than he had paid for them at auction. Trading Standards officers sifted. through documents and sales records relating to 123 vehicles, 111 of. which had already been sold. The. remaining 12 vehicles found in Alvey’s possession were seized. Only. four of the 123 vehicles had not had their milometer readings altered. In. total, 22 of the vehicles had milometer readings reduced by 100,000. miles or more, with two vans having more than 200,000 miles wiped off. their real mileage. Councillor Mick Murphy, Cabinet. member for community safety at Nottinghamshire County Council, said: 'The extent of the vehicle clocking in this case is absolutely shocking. 'Mr. Alvey not only ripped off unsuspecting buyers, he placed their safety. at risk by making them think they were driving a vehicle with much less. wear and tear.' Alvey, has admitted 10 counts of fraud and will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court today. His then-partner, Jane Louise Starbrook, was cleared of any involvement in the fraud at an earlier hearing. Following. sentencing, Trading Standards’ Proceeds of Crime team will begin. proceedings to recoup profits Alvey has made from the van scam. Highlights:","output":"- A person named Maxwell Stuart Alvey did a bad thing by changing the mileage on cars to sell them for more money. - He made more than £100,000 in 10 months by tricking people. - People noticed something was wrong with the cars, so they complained. - Alvey lied about the mileage on a special car called a Mercedes Sprinter. - He will be in trouble and go to court for doing this bad thing. - Only a few cars were not changed, but many other cars had their mileage changed too."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Research Finnish equivalents for the key terms:     - recent research = viimeaikaiset tutkimukset    - increase = lisääminen    - decrease = vähentäminen    - nephrops quotas = norppakantojen kiintiöt    - positive = myönteistä    - regeneration = uusiutuminen    - cod stocks = turskakannat 3. Order the Finnish terms according to Finnish grammar rules and create a coherent sentence structure:      - Esimerkiksi (for example) - to smoothly start the sentence with the main idea.     - viimeaikaiset tutkimukset - as the subject.     - viittaavat siihen - to connect the subject to the main point of the sentence.     - että - to introduce the dependent clause.     - norppakantojen kiintiöiden lisääminen pikemminkin kuin vähentäminen - as the object of the dependent clause.     - voisi itse asiassa - to emphasize that this is a surprising or counterintuitive result.     - olla myönteistä turskakantojen uusiutumiselle - to describe the specific positive outcome. 4. Review the final translation for accuracy and clarity:     - Esimerkiksi viimeaikaiset tutkimukset viittaavat siihen, että norppakantojen kiintiöiden lisääminen pikemminkin kuin vähentäminen voisi itse asiassa olla myönteistä turskakantojen uusiutumiselle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A plume of smoke emits from a fire that broke out at a Chevron oil refinery in Richmond, California August 6, 2012.      RICHMOND/HOUSTON (Reuters) - A massive fire struck at the core of Chevron Corp's large Richmond, California, refinery on Monday, spewing flames and a column of smoke into the air, threatening a prolonged outage that may increase prices of the costliest U.S. gasoline.      The fire was contained, but not extinguished, according to the company. The fire has blazed for hours after it erupted at the refinery in a densely populated industrial suburb of San Francisco. Smoke could be seen billowing over the Bay Area and four train stations were shut.      Nearby residents were ordered indoors after the fire hit the sole crude unit at the 245,000 barrel per day (bpd) plant, which accounts for one-eighth of California state's refining capacity. About 200 people have sought medical help, complaining of respiratory problems, the San Pablo, California-based Doctors Medical Center said in a statement.      The fire had started in the No. 4 crude unit, the only one at the plant, at 6:15 p.m. shortly after a leak was discovered, Chevron said. As the leak grew, workers were evacuated, plant manager Nigel Hearn told journalists at the site. He said some units were still operating, but gave no details.      It was not immediately clear when the fire would be put out and the extent of damage to the plant was not known.      \\"I walked outside and saw what looked like a lot of steam coming out of Chevron, way more than usual. I thought they must have blown a boiler,\\" said Ryan Lackay, a 45-year-old employee at a chemical plant next door to the refinery.      \\"And then all of a sudden it just went whoosh, it ignited.\\"      Crude distillation units (CDUs) break down oil into feedstock for other units in a refinery. It can take months to repair a CDU at a large plant, during which operations are typically severely limited.      Any lengthy disruption in production could affect the supply of fuel in the West Coast, particularly gasoline, due to the difficulty in meeting California's super-clean specifications. The region also has few immediate alternative supply sources.      \\"Chevron will have a hard time finding replacement barrels in an already short market,\\" said Bob van der Valk, a petroleum industry analyst in Terry, Montana.      \\"Refineries are already drawing down summer blend inventory in anticipation of the switch back to winter blend gasoline.\\"      TOWERING FLAMES, BLACK SMOKE      Residents of Richmond were advised to \\"shelter in place\\", an order often given during refinery accidents to shield against possible exposure to toxic chemicals or smoke. Sulfuric acid and nitrogen dioxide were released during the incident, according to a filing with the California Emergency Management Agency.      The refinery, the third largest in California and among the oldest in the country, is key to the economy of Richmond, a declining industrial city. But it has stirred controversy among local residents concerned about the environmental impacts and local politicians often seeking more tax revenues.      \\"I looked out the window and saw 40 foot flames and black smoke,\\" Marc Mowrey, a Point Richmond resident who lives about a mile from the plant, said in a telephone interview.      He said the smell was not exceptional or very different from other days, but a huge plume of smoke was sitting over Richmond and neighboring El Cerrito.      Chevron said in a statement that there had been only one minor injury at the refinery, which at its peak 10 years ago employed over 1,300 people on a site of over 2,900 acres.      Last week, the refinery reported vapor leaks and a compressor failure to California pollution regulators, according to notices. The notices did not say which units were involved.      We are \\"very disappointed that this happened, and apologize that we are inconveniencing our neighbors,\\" Chevron spokesman Walt Gill told local television.      A Reuters reporter who lives nearby said he heard some loud bangs and a siren as the fire erupted, but a Chevron spokesman denied reports of an explosion.      It is common to shut down the entire plant in the event of a major blaze. A February 17 fire at the CDU of BP Plc's 225,000 bpd Cherry Point, Washington, refinery led to a three-month shutdown and sent the regional price premium to more than 1 a gallon in some places.

NBCNews.com's Dara Brown reports.      Updated at 8:05 a.m. ET: A massive fire struck at the core of Chevron's large Richmond, Calif., refinery on Monday, spewing flames and a column of smoke into the air, and threatening a prolonged outage that may increase prices of U.S. gasoline.      The fire was contained by 11 p.m. (2 a.m. ET), according to the company. The fire blazed for hours after it erupted at the refinery in a densely populated industrial suburb east of San Francisco. Smoke could be seen billowing over the Bay Area and four train stations were shut.      Thousands of local residents were ordered to stay indoors and shut all windows and doors after the fire hit the sole crude unit at the 245,000 barrel per day plant, which accounts for one-eighth of California state's refining capacity. But that order was later lifted.      \\"I heard a big boom ... then the alarms started going off,\\" 23-year-old local resident Daniela Rodriguez told the Contra Costa Times.      \\"I was getting kind of scared. I went into my backyard and could see a big, dark gray cloud. I saw it was coming from where the refinery is, so I told my mom to lock the windows,\\" the newspaper quoted her as saying.      Read more about this story on NBCBayArea.com      The plume from the fire reached an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 feet above ground level, officials said at a news conference, according to the Times.      No fatalities      All workers had been accounted for and no fatalities were reported, but one employee was treated at an on-site clinic for burns to his wrist, the San Francisco Chronicle said.      About 200 people have sought medical help, complaining of respiratory problems, the San Pablo, Calif.-based Doctors Medical Center said in a statement.      \\"They told me I'm not going to die, but it sure feels pretty serious,\\" 21-year-old Richmond resident Julius Bailey told the Chronicle after seeing a doctor for respiratory complaints at Kaiser’s Richmond Medical Center.      The fire had started in the No. 4 crude unit, the only one at the plant, at 6:15 p.m. shortly after a leak was discovered, Chevron said.

The explosions started about 6:15 p.m., and at least two large fires spewed thick, black smoke into the darkening sky.      The fire started at the refinery's No. 4 Crude Unit, Chevron officials said. Just before 6:30 p.m., an inspection crew discovered that there was a diesel leak in a line in the unit - and that the leak was growing.      Shortly after the crew evacuated the area, the diesel ignited, said Nigel Hearne, manager of the refinery.      All employees had been accounted for and there were no fatalities, but one refinery worker suffered burns to his wrist and was treated at the on-site clinic.      About five minutes after the explosions, sirens tore through the air, alerting residents to stay indoors to prevent breathing tainted air. Some people got in their cars and drove away from the smoke that spread throughout the neighborhoods east of the refinery.      \\"Everybody evacuated so fast people's car alarms were going off,\\" said Sara Monares, 55, who lives a short distance from the refinery.      Health officials' main concern was fumes from crude oil and diesel fuel, but winds were carrying the smoke and pollutants skyward, said Maria Duazo, a hazardous materials specialist with the Contra Costa County Health Services Department.      A shelter-in-place warning was issued for Richmond, North Richmond and San Pablo and remained in effect late Monday. An advisory for those with lung conditions or a sensitivity to smoke to stay indoors was expanded to all of Contra Costa County. Residents as far away as the Oakland hills were being warned by police about smoke heading that way.      Air samples taken      As the smoke stretched out over the El Cerrito hills, Contra Costa County hazardous materials units rolled through the neighborhoods, taking air samples.      Trisha Asuncion, hazardous materials specialist with Contra Costa County, said that no hazardous compounds had been detected in the air, but that monitoring would continue.      Kaiser's Richmond Medical Center said several dozen people came to the emergency room Monday night complaining of shortness of breath, but none was seriously ill.      Julius Bailey, 21, who lives on Barrett Avenue in Richmond, blocks away from the refinery, was at the hospital wearing a face mask. He said his throat had started burning and his eyes itching. After seeing a doctor, he said, \\"They told me I'm not going to die, but it sure feels pretty serious.\\"      BART closed the Richmond, El Cerrito del Norte and El Cerrito Plaza stations at about 7 p.m., and shut down service between Richmond and El Cerrito and Richmond and North Berkeley about 30 minutes later. Only the Richmond Station remained closed late Monday.      Toll takers on the westbound Richmond-San Rafael Bridge were told to take shelter because of the fire, said Officer Ralph Caggiano, a California Highway Patrol spokesman. He said he wasn't sure whether cash-paying drivers would get a free trip, but drivers with FasTrak were still being charged tolls.      Previous fires      The Chevron Richmond refinery was founded more than a century ago and is Northern California's largest, capable of processing more than 242,000 barrels of oil each day. It is the third-largest refinery in the state. A prolonged closure could push up gasoline prices, which are already rising nationwide because of a rally in the market for crude oil.      The refinery has suffered fires before. In January of 2007, the seal on a pump in a crude unit failed, triggering a fire that lasted almost 10 hours.      David Rorai, 60, was working as a welder for Chevron about a decade ago when another explosion injured several workers.      \\"On that last one, we ran like hell,\\" he said, as he stood watching the smoke from Monday night's fires. \\"We got in our cars and left. I feel for those guys in there right now.\\" Rorai said danger is just a fact of the job when you work around explosive gases.      \\"You got to figure if the guy next to you didn't clear his line right or wasn't being careful, that's it for you,\\" he said. \\"Comes with the job.\\"      Chevron has for years wanted to overhaul and upgrade the facility. But many Richmond residents and environmentalists have objected, saying the project would create more air pollution in a community that already has too much. Although Richmond's City Council approved the renovation project in 2008, a judge halted construction work the next year, ruling that Chevron had not answered key questions in the project's environmental impact report.      Monday night, along a fence line on Barrett Avenue in Richmond, a dozen children and teenagers stood fixated, covering their mouths with their shirts as they watched the smoke pour into the sky. They said they had never seen anything like this in their lives.      \\"When I heard the booms, I was scared and hid because I thought it was grenades,\\" said Dai'lonie Fuller, 12. \\"I'm just here to get a look, and then I'm staying inside.\\"      Under the spreading plume of smoke sat the Christian Home Missionary Church, about a block from the fence. While one singer coughed, the dozen-woman choir sang, despite evacuation orders, their urgent gospel music filling the empty street outside.      \\"We've got a funeral to sing at tomorrow, and that doesn't wait,\\" said Laura Young, 65. \\"We're trying to do what we've got to do.\\"      The song they were singing was \\"God Will Take Care of You.\\"      The fire dwindled down to a few thin twists of smoke by about 8:30 p.m., but flames still flickered beyond what observers could see from the perimeter. Chevron officials said crews were fighting the blaze with nitrogen and steam to keep it cool, but had no estimate as to when it would be extinguished.      By 8:45 p.m., the winds shifted to the west, blowing the smoke away from the city and into the bay, said Greg Lawler, a health services hazardous materials specialist for Contra Costa County.      Ken Workman, 47, stood on Macdonald Avenue, peeking through the fence at the fire and shaking his head. He has lived a couple of blocks away since 1987 and said he thinks the refinery doesn't do enough to protect local residents.      \\"The wind never blows that smoke to Marin County, now does it?\\" he said. \\"They made sure of that. I think it's intentional that they don't protect us.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A big fire happened at an oil refinery in Richmond, California on August 6, 2012. The refinery is owned by Chevron, a big oil company. The fire made a huge cloud of smoke go up into the sky. People living nearby were told to stay inside their homes to avoid breathing in the smoke. Some people had problems with their breathing because of the smoke. The fire took a long time to put out, and the damage it caused meant that it might make gasoline (petrol) prices go up in the area."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Casey Coombs, a freelance journalist, was flown to Oman where he was met by the US ambassador. Last week, the Washington Post reported that at least four Americans were being held by Houthi rebels. Meanwhile, a video of a Frenchwoman kidnapped in February has been posted, in which she appeals for efforts to be made to secure her release. Isabelle Prime, who worked as a consultant on a World Bank-funded project, was seized with her translator, who was later freed, as they were driving to work in the capital, Sanaa. She called for French President Francois Hollande and Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to help secure her release, saying: \\"Please bring me to France fast because I am really, really tired.\\" A French official has confirmed the authenticity of the video, but the identity of her captors remains unclear. Mr Coombs, who wrote for the news website the Intercept, was captured in Yemen several weeks ago. In April he reported that he was having difficulty leaving the country, \\"like hundreds - and possibly thousands - of other American citizens\\". US State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Mr Coombs had arrived safely in Oman following his release and was in a \\"stable condition\\". \\"We are grateful to the government of Oman and personally to Sultan Qaboos for assisting with the safe passage of a US citizen to Oman,\\" she added. She declined to provide any further details, but said the US was doing everything possible to secure the freedom of the other American citizens being held in Sanaa. Mr Coombs' mother, Jill Hammill, told the Washington Post she was \\"overjoyed\\" by her son's release. The Oman News Agency said a Singaporean citizen was also evacuated from Yemen on Monday and taken to the Omani capital Muscat. Oman has been brokering talks between the Houthis and the United States to put an end to Yemen's civil war. The Houthis and army units loyal to Yemen's former leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, overran Sanaa in September last year and are now in control of several other cities. In December, US journalist Luke Somers and South African teacher Pierre Korkie died during a failed attempt by US commandos to rescue them from an al-Qaeda hideout in south-eastern Yemen. The UN says two months of fighting and air strikes have left at least 1,037 civilians dead, including 130 women and 234 children, and displaced half a million others. There has also been massive destruction of civilian infrastructure, and a sea and air blockade has caused severe shortages of food, water, medicine and fuel. Summary:","output":"A freelance journalist named Casey Coombs was taken to Oman where he met the US ambassador. He was captured by some bad people called Houthi rebels in Yemen. Four other Americans are still being held by these rebels. A French lady named Isabelle Prime, who was also kidnapped, has made a video asking for help from the French President and the Yemeni President. In Yemen, there is a big fight going on and many people, including women and children, have been hurt or lost their homes. People are having trouble finding food, water, medicine, and fuel because of the fighting.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: on your esophagus to widen it. In this procedure, your doctor will insert dilators into your esophagus to widen it using a scope that is inserted in your throat. You will be under general anesthesia during the surgery so you will not feel any pain. This surgery is invasive but it is considered less extreme than a myotomy. If medication and other treatments do not work, your doctor may suggest a myotomy, where the muscles at the lower end of your esophagus are surgically cut. This can then weaken esophageal contractions in your throat and make it easier for you to swallow. You will be under general anesthesia during this procedure so you will not feel any pain. It is considered a serious surgery and is often only done as a last resort if other treatments for your spasms do not work. You will need to stay in the hospital overnight after the surgery and allow 1-3 weeks for recovery. It will be difficult for you to swallow solid foods so a liquid diet, and some soft foods, are good during your recovery. You will also need to go in for a special X-ray of the area to ensure the surgery was successful.  Your doctor will also schedule a follow up with you one to two weeks after the surgery to ensure the area is healing properly and there are no signs of infection.

So he invented a very simple camera. He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his garden. That was the first photo. The next important date in the history of photography was in 1837.That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his reading-room. He used a new kind of camera in a different way. In his picture you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest thing. The kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype. Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travellers brought back wonderful photos from all round the world. People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains. In about 1840, photography was developed . Then photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of film and other machines. But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard.Mathew Brady was a famous American photographer. He took many pictures of great people. The pictures were unusual because they were very lifelike . Photographers also became one kind of art by the end of the 19th century.

Question: Information:  - Sir Alexander Oppenheim , OBE FRSE PMN ( 4 February 1903 -- 13 December 1997 ) was a British mathematician . In mathematics , his most notable contribution is his Oppenheim conjecture .  - Ergodic theory (Ancient Greek: \\"ergon\\" work, \\"hodos\\" way) is a branch of mathematics that studies dynamical systems with an invariant measure and related problems. Its initial development was motivated by problems of statistical physics.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - In number theory, the field of Diophantine approximation deals with the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers. It is named after Diophantus of Alexandria.  - A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - In Diophantine approximation, the Oppenheim conjecture concerns representations of numbers by real quadratic forms in several variables. It was formulated in 1929 by Alexander Oppenheim and later the conjectured property was further strengthened by Davenport and Oppenheim. Initial research on this problem took the number \\"n\\" of variables to be large, and applied a version of the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. The definitive work of Margulis, settling the conjecture in the affirmative, used methods arising from ergodic theory and the study of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups.  - In mathematics, a quadratic form is a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in a number of variables. For example, is a quadratic form in the variables \\"x\\" and \\"y\\".    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'alexander oppenheim' exhibits the relationship of 'field of work'. Find the answer from the choices below.

England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley. W. B. Squire wrote in 1885: His sense of form was so strong, and his refined nature so abhorred any mere seeking after effect, that his music sometimes gives the impression of being produced under restraint. He seldom, if ever, gave rein to his unbridled fancy; everything is justly proportioned, clearly defined, and kept within the limits which the conscientiousness of his self-criticism would not let him overstep. It is this which makes him, as has been said, so peculiarly a musician's composer: the broad effects and bold contrasts which an uneducated public admires are absent; it takes an educated audience to appreciate to the full the exquisitely refined and delicate nature of his genius. Temperley suggests that, despite his reverence for Mendelssohn, Bennett took Mozart as his model. Geoffrey Bush agrees that \\"[h]is best work, like his piano playing, was full of passion none the less powerful for being Mozartian (that is to say, perfectly controlled)\\", and characterizes him as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\"., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Yes, based on the information provided in the article, the name of the person who Geoffrey Bush characterizes as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\" is Bennett."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"They tried to survive\\" correctly answer the question \\"What three things did we learn about the Moors?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"They tried to survive\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"What three things did we learn about the Moors?\\" based on the given paragraph. Instead, here are three points that can be derived from the text: 1. The Moors were able to maintain their presence in the Iberian peninsula and the Balearic Islands for several centuries despite continuous Christian attempts to evict them during the Reconquest. 2. After the fall of Mallorca, the Moors (forcibly converted to Christianity) contributed their talents to the island's prosperity under King Jaume I's rule, highlighting their adaptability and resilience. 3. The Moors of Menorca initially avoided conflict by agreeing to pay an annual tribute to Aragón, showing their diplomatic strategies for maintaining peace and independence. However, they were eventually defeated and expelled by Alfonso III, which led to Menorca's economy being devastated for decades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hayek's principal investigations in economics concerned capital, money, and the business cycle. Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for \\"industrial fluctuations\\" based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the \\"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\\". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that \\"the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process\\".

Hot, spicy and all man.\\"      These are sexy novels aimed at straight and gay readers. The new spin on Sherlock Holmes casts the detective and his sidekick John Watson as gay lovers.      Here Watson stumbles on two male lovers in a tryst. \\"Confusion claimed me for a moment, and my mouth dropped open as I took it all in. The joy of knowing other men were the same as I was quickly eclipsed by the fear that if they were caught it would be the end for them.

The company said that it was \\"100% convinced\\" that there was a market for the racy versions of the 19th century novels by authors Charlotte Bronte and Jane Austen and that the spicing up of the much-loved books will introduce the classics to \\"a new generation of readers\\".      Other titles to be published under the Clandestine Classics collection include Austen's Northanger Abbey and Arthur Conan Doyle's stories featuring Sherlock Holmes.

Click here or on \\"View Gallery\\" for extracts from the books      Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen      The sexual tension between Mr Darcy and Miss Elizabeth Bennet sizzles without any explicit suggestion in Austen’s beloved classic. But imagine if instead of showing her around the grounds at Pemberley, Darcy had brought Lizzy into his playroom? OK, so that doesn’t actually happen in the Clandestine Classic reworking, but it’s still pretty steamy. Here’s an extract:      Elizabeth trailed kisses along his throat and neck until she reached his earlobe and took it between her teeth. “Please take me,” she whispered. “I need it. I ache for it.” Her words were met with only a grunt of approval by Darcy.      He pulled back from her and checked their surroundings, partly to assure they were alone, but also to discover a hiding place for them that was away from the road. He took hold of Elizabeth’s hand and pulled her away from the lane to the trees beyond. They walked on for a short time until they came to a small clearing and without another word, he pulled her to the ground, laying her down on the grass and covering her body with his.      Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen      To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen, is to do pretty well, Catherine Morland surmises at the end of this early Austen classic. But what if she and Henry had found some, er happiness prior to his proposal? Here's an extract:      [Catherine] began to wish for Henry Tilney to find his way secretly to her room to help allay her nervousness. When the door to her room opened slowly she searched frantically for something with which to defend herself, not knowing if it was ghost of human who trespassed.      When she saw Henry slip into the room, fingers to his lips, she poofed out a sigh of relief. Had just thinking of him conjured him up? “What are you doing here?” she whispered as softly as she could, noticing that he had divested himself of all his clothes save a thin pair of breeches and a loose shirt. “I feared the storm would disturb you and wanted to ease you through it.”      Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte      The dominating/subservient dynamic of Bronte's novel might even make readers of the \\"Fifty Shades\\" series blush. Imagine if mousy governess Jane had told her \\"master\\" Mr Rochester exactly what she wanted to do to him? At the novel's close she finds her voice. Here's what might have happened:      At once I saw he meant to kiss me once again. His lips would be relentless and ruthless; and the taste of him—the smokiness of his cigar combined with his uncivilised power—would render me helpless.      “Surrender, sweet Jane.”      “Nay, sir, I cannot; I will not.”            His thick brows furrowed above those eyes. Though the sun had been swallowed by eve, the intent was as clear as a spring brook. Mr Rochester would have me. Any further protest was swallowed by his lips. I knew I could have turned away; he held my hands—thus my upper body—imprisoned at the small of my back. My head was free.      “Kiss me,” he commanded, moving closer.

The f-duct aerodynamic system, which channels air flow to allow vehicles to go faster on the straights, has also been adapted by Ferrari. However, concerns have arisen about how the feature is operated, with Ferrari's version requiring the driver to open and close a hole in the cockpit with his hands -- meaning less control over the steering wheel. McLaren unsuccessfully tried to convince the other teams at a meeting before Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, won by Red Bull's Mark Webber, that the innovation should not be barred. Earlier this year, the OPTIONS: - CNN teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. - Ferrari teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. - Formula One teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. - Grand Prix teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. - Mark Webber teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. - McLaren teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. - Mercedes teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. - Red Bull teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. - Spanish teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season.","output":"Formula One teams voted to ban the double-diffuser system from next season. As a result of the concerns raised by the rest of the Formula One teams, they collectively voted to ban the double-diffuser system from the next season. The decision was made after taking into consideration the potential safety issues associated with the f-duct aerodynamic system and ensuring the focus remains on safe driving without compromising the core objective of the sport - to maintain a competitive edge and showcase innovation. The ban of the double-diffuser system will create an equal playing field for all teams, ensuring that no single team has an unfair advantage due to this controversial technology. This decision also reflects the commitment of the Formula One community to prioritize driver safety, as engaging in the use of this system could lead to accidents and other unforeseen incidents on the track. Despite McLaren's attempts to persuade the other teams that their innovation should be allowed to continue, the overwhelming majority of teams agreed that the feature presented unnecessary risks and had the potential to disrupt the balance of the competition. Therefore, it was deemed to be in the best interest of the sport and its participants to eliminate the use of such technology. The Formula One governing body will be responsible for implementing this new ban and ensuring that no team attempts to gain an unfair advantage through the use of any system similar to the f-duct or the double-diffuser system. Teams will need to adapt their car designs accordingly, making modifications ahead of the next season to ensure compliance with this new rule. In conclusion, the story ends with the Formula One teams putting driver safety and fair competition at the forefront of their decision-making. By voting to ban the controversial double-diffuser system from the next season, they have demonstrated a commitment to ensuring that technological advancements in the sport do not compromise the integrity and safety of the races.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Grant.  for the following movie plot:  In December of 2002, Grant Taylor's (Alex Kendrick) Eagles, of Shiloh Christian Academy, are slightly behind against the Tucker Tigers, late in the fourth quarter. Taylor shouts to Zach Avery (Brandon Glow), \\"Cross the Thirty!\\" He wants his offense to get within good field-goal position. But Zach, though his receiver Jonathan Weston (Tommy McBride) is open, gets sacked. Since this is fourth down, the Tigers take the ball, fall on it, and run out the clock. So ends the game, and another losing season--Taylor's sixth in a row.The 2003 season begins with some dire news: Darrin, the Eagles' top scorer in 2002, has moved in with his father so he can transfer to the rival Tucker school. Taylor's offensive and defensive co-ordinators, J. T. Hawkins (Chris Willis) and Brady Owens (Tracy Goode), break it to him. He then has to break it to his players, who of course take it very badly.When Grant drives home, his car dies after he barely gets off the road. His house has a very bad smell, which neither he nor his wife Brooke (Shannen Fields) can figure out. THeir evening meal will be cold, because their stove does not work.

I don't know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90's, but it helps if you do. In the 90's when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc). Also there were the wanna b's, accessible rappers that start making the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C&C Music Factory, etc). This movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like it's an actually documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff/director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott/Revenge of the Nerds, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial. Whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it. But, if you know 80's/90's rap, you know how much of this stuff is true. Still, on it's own, without hip hop knowledge, it is still a funny funny movie. And for all of those who ask, yes Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof movie either. This, in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways, better than Spinal Tap. As Spinal Tap is to heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is to Rap. And the songs are off the hook also. The DVD is chalk full of extras to include music videos of NWH as a group and as solo artists.

Summarize this article: Michele Bachmann, GOP presidential hopeful suggests HPV vaccination may cause 'mental retardation'      Win McNamee/Getty Republican presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann speaks during a presidential debate sponsored by CNN and The Tea Party Express on Monday.      Michele Bachmann's latest attack on Texas Gov. Rick Perry may be hurting her more than him.      Some in the medical community are speaking out against the Minnesota congresswoman, who blasted her fellow GOP presidential candidate this week for mandating that sixth grade girls in his state be vaccinated against HPV, a sexually transmitted disease.      On NBC's \\"Today,\\" Bachmann suggested the HPV vaccine might cause \\"mental retardation,\\" a notion that has been largely dismissed.      \\"I had a mother last night come up to me here in Tampa, Florida, after the debate,\\" recalled Bachmann.      \\"She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. It can have very dangerous side effects. … This is the very real concern, and people have to draw their own conclusions.\\"      Margaret Nygren, Executive Director of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, told the Daily News that \\"there is no credible scientific evidence linking vaccines and autism or any intellectual and developmental disabilities,\\"      Peter Berns, CEO of The Arc, a national organization that advocates for the rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, agreed.      \\"Statements linking vaccines to intellectual disability with no medical research evidence can unnecessarily alarm parents seeking vaccinations for their children and spread misinformation about intellectual disabilities,\\" Berns said. \\"There are many known causes of intellectual disabilities including Down syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and Fragile X Syndrome, none of which are attributable to the process of vaccinations.\\"      And Pam Eisele, a spokeswoman for Merck, which makes the HPV vaccine Gardasil, told the Daily News that \\"we are confident in the safety profile of Gardasil. And while no vaccine or medicine is completely without risk, leading health organizations throughout the world have reviewed all of the safety information about Gardasil and continue to recommend its use.\\"      A spokesman for Bachmann did not return requests seeking comment.      Perry signed a 2007 executive order requiring the vaccine to prevent human papillomavirus, an STD that can lead to cervical cancer. The decision - heavily criticized by conservatives - was eventually overturned by the state Legislature.      At Monday night's debate in Tampa, Fla. Perry called his vaccine mandate a \\"mistake.\\"      \\"Indeed, if I had it to do over again, I would have done it differently,\\" Perry said, although he noted that Texas parents could have elected to \\"opt out\\" of the vaccine.      \\"I would have gone to the Legislature, worked with them. But what was driving me was, obviously, making a difference about young people's lives.\\"      David Schultz, a political analyst at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., called Bachmann's move strategic, arguing that she is trying to hang on to conservatives voters who are fleeing her camp for Perry's.      \\"In her base, there are many that firmly believe there's a connection between the two [HPV vaccination and mental disabilities], facts not withstanding,\\" Schultz told the Daily News. \\"The fact is, a lot of supporters behind Bachmann do fit in that category and she's trying to recapture that base.\\" ||||| Bachmann on whether HPV vaccine causes mental retardation: 'I have no idea'      Posted at 4:47 PM on September 13, 2011 by Tom Scheck (8 Comments)      Filed under: Campaign 2012, Michele Bachmann      GOP Rep. Michele Bachmann appears to be backing off suggestions that the HPV vaccine could cause mental retardation.            Here's what she told Fox News last night:      \\"There's a woman who came up crying to me tonight after the debate. She said her daughter was given that vaccine. She told me her daughter suffered mental retardation as a result. There are very dangerous consequences.\\"      She used the same anecdote on the Today Show this morning.      But Bachmann backed away from the comment later when she appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show. Hannity asked Bachmann whether side effects from the HPV vaccine include mental retardation.      \\"I have no idea,\\" Bachmann told Hannity. \\"I am not a doctor. I am not a scientist. I am not a physician. All I was doing was reporting what a woman told me last night at the debate.\\"      The HPV vaccine became an issue after Bachmann and other GOP presidential candidates criticized Texas Gov. Rick Perry for issuing an executive order that would require girls to get the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The mandatory vaccinations never materialized because the Texas Legislature rescinded the order. Perry's Chief of Staff later became a lobbyist for Merck, which manufactures the HPV vaccine. It's been an issue that has haunted Perry's campaign.      Conservative activists have been skeptical of efforts to require the vaccine because it takes away parental rights and could encourage young women to engage in sexual activities. Efforts to require the vaccine in Minnesota have been defeated.      The medical community has been pushing young men and women to get vaccinated against HPV, a sexually transmitted disease, because it would prevent genital warts and some cases of cervical cancer.      MPR reports today that some members of the medical community say Bachmann's recent comments are troubling and potentially dangerous.      \\"HPV vaccine is an extraordinarily safe and effective vaccine,\\" said Dr. Bill Schaffner, who chairs the Department of Preventative Medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and has an international reputation as an immunization expert. \\"It's a huge advance is women's health because it will prevent about 70 percent of the cases of cancer of the cervix.\\"      Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh also criticized Bachmann.      \\"That's jumping the shark on this,\\" Limbaugh said. \\"There's no evidence that the vaccine causes mental retardation.\\"                  Comments (8)      I believe a better to way to word this part of the article would be to say that conservatives claim that HPV takes away parental rights & could encourage young women to engage in sexual activities. Neither of these is an established fact.      I don't think the point of the article was to reword what the candidates are saying, but to report on Michelle Bachmann her previous claims, the backlash caused by them, and her backing away from them.      \\"The medical community has been pushing young men and women to get vaccinated against HPV, a sexually transmitted disease, because it would prevent genital warts and some cases of cervical cancer.\\"      The 70% reduction in cervical cancer cited in a subsequent paragraph is a conservative estimate - I have seen estimates as high as 90% of those cancers would be prevented. Even at 70%, a phrase like \\"a vast majority\\" is far more appropriate than \\"some\\".      Additionally, HPV is linked by recent research to many throat and oral cancers and is the second leading cause of such cancers after tobacco use.      The political push against HPV vaccination is the same as the political push against condom information in schools. In spite of the fact that no evidence supports the view that HPV vaccination leads to earlier onset of sexual activity, frightened parents and politicians have worked to limit access to the vaccine.      The median age of initial sexual activity in this country is 13 or 14 (see the book Harmful to Minors). HPV is a skin to skin disease that is easily passed by pre-intercourse sexual activity.      Political games like Bachmann and the Texas legislature are playing, that sow misinformation that disincentivises the use of that vaccine, not only lead to many, many people developing cancers that were completely avoidable, it adds a tremendous cost strain to the healthcare system in this country.      It's disgusting. I realize as a news organization, you want to be \\"fair and balanced,\\" but come on. When completely ridiculous things are said by public figures, they should be called completely ridiculous.            If Bachmann could not a little heat as she displayed in the debate Tuesday night (as she stood with a sour looking face) how could she take any heat from all of the problems she would face as President?      My VOTE IS FOR GOV.PERRY.      I totally disagree with making any such HPV vaccine mandatory by government.

Reading time is generally affected by a number of factors such as the number of words, language complexity, reading speed, and comprehension level. In this instance, the difference in reading time between the book and the magazine can be attributed to the quantity of words in each material. The book, being a more comprehensive material, consists of more words than the magazine. Books are typically written to provide in-depth knowledge and incorporate detailed explanations, making them lengthier. On the other hand, magazines contain articles that are usually concise and focused, delivering information in a more compact manner. Aside from the number of words, the type and language complexity can also significantly influence reading time. For instance, if the book employs a more complex language and deeper literary techniques compared to the magazine, this might contribute to requiring more time and effort to comprehend the content. However, it is important to note that the reading speed of each individual can vary drastically. Some people are naturally faster readers, while others may require additional time to process the information. Similarly, comprehension levels from one individual to another can differ significantly, affecting how quickly they can grasp the concepts and ideas presented in the material. In conclusion, the primary reason that it took longer to read the book than the magazine is that the book contained more words (option a).

Does the cut on Karen's right arm have more or less white blood cells than the cut on her left arm?  After working out in the yard for the day doing various chores, Karen comes back inside to prepare for a shower. While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering.  Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. The answer is:","output":"The cut on Karen's right arm has more white blood cells than the cut on her left arm."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: The bill probably has a reasonable chance of passing. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. I will provide a thorough explanation for better understanding. First, let us break down both the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: Geveden agrees that the bill's chances for passage are pretty reasonable. Hypothesis: The bill probably has a reasonable chance of passing. In the premise, we are given the information that Geveden believes the bill has a pretty reasonable chance of passage. The word \\"pretty\\" is used as an intensifier, indicating that Geveden has a notable degree of confidence in the likelihood of the bill's passage. \\"Reasonable\\" in this context refers to the probability or likelihood of the event occurring, which is the bill passing in this case. Now, let us examine the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the bill probably has a reasonable chance of passing. The word \\"probably\\" indicates a level of possibility or likelihood, which again relates to how likely the bill is to pass. The use of the term \\"reasonable chance\\" is consistent with the premise, suggesting that it is a feasible and acceptable possibility that the bill could pass. Given these observations, it is evident that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise provides the information that Geveden believes there is a reasonable chance of the bill passing, and the hypothesis states the same idea, asserting that the bill most likely has a reasonable chance of passage. Consequently, the hypothesis aligns with and naturally follows from the premise, illustrating that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. In summary, the hypothesis, which claims that the bill probably has a reasonable chance of passing, is indeed entailed by the premise, as the premise informs us that Geveden believes the bill's chances for passage are pretty reasonable. Both the premise and the hypothesis convey the same notion that the bill's passage has a feasible likelihood, confirming their mutual entailment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Some sicko who calls himself Dwight Renfield, as in Dwight Frye who played the role of Renfield in the 1931 movie version of Dracula, is flying from desolate airport to desolate airport in his black Cessna Skymaster 337, tail number N101BL, killing whomever is there and then drinking their blood--and no one has caught him yet.

Article: Some of the second-generation renewables, such as wind power, have high potential and have already realised relatively low production costs. Global wind power installations increased by 35,800 MW in 2010, bringing total installed capacity up to 194,400 MW, a 22.5% increase on the 158,700 MW installed at the end of 2009. The increase for 2010 represents investments totalling €47.3 billion (US65 billion) and for the first time more than half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets of Europe and North America, mainly driven, by the continuing boom in China which accounted for nearly half of all of the installations at 16,500 MW. China now has 42,300 MW of wind power installed. Wind power accounts for approximately 19% of electricity generated in Denmark, 9% in Spain and Portugal, and 6% in Germany and the Republic of Ireland. In Australian state of South Australia wind power, championed by Premier Mike Rann (2002–2011), now comprises 26% of the state's electricity generation, edging out coal fired power.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? an oddly fascinating depiction","output":"To accurately analyze the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"an oddly fascinating depiction,\\" it is essential to not only consider its explicit context but also the potential connotations associated with each word. Sentiment analysis is the process of understanding the emotions or opinions conveyed by a piece of text, and in this specific context, gauging the reviewer's opinion on a particular film. In this explanation, we'll examine the sentiment of this sentence by breaking it down into its essential parts. Let's start by examining the key terms in the sentence: 1. 'oddly': This adverb can give a sense of peculiarity or uniqueness to the term that follows it. It might initially seem to express a neutral or slightly negative sentiment, as the word 'odd' may hint at something unusual or hard to understand. However, it often embraces the idea of uniqueness and distinctiveness, which can be considered as a positive aspect in some cases. 2. 'fascinating': This adjective indicates that the speaker finds the subject to be captivating, intriguing, or engrossing. This definitely carries a positive sentiment, as it reveals that the speaker is impressed or absorbed by the film's particular aspect. 3. 'depiction': This noun refers to the portrayal or representation of someone or something in an artistic work such as a movie. It is a neutral term that doesn't portray any sentiment on its own, but instead, opens up space for evaluation and opinions. Now let's analyze the sentiment of the sentence as a whole: \\"an oddly fascinating depiction\\" implies that the reviewer finds the portrayal in the movie to be both peculiar and captivating. The combination of \\"oddly\\" and \\"fascinating\\" presents a positive sentiment with a touch of intrigue, as the pairing conveys that the movie has managed to grasp the viewer's interest through its distinctive portrayal. The word \\"oddly\\" enriches the statement as it highlights that the fascination stems from the unconventional or unexpected nature of the film. In conclusion, the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"an oddly fascinating depiction\\" can be described as positively inclined with a hint of intrigue. While the term \\"oddly\\" might initially suggest a degree of ambiguity, its pairing with the positive term \\"fascinating\\" creates an overall sense of appreciation for the film's unique and captivating representation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Simplify the equation: Since 0*t is always equal to 0, the equation can be simplified to:    0 = 26*t + 52 2. Isolate the term with the variable t: To do this, we want to get t alone on one side of the equation. We can start by subtracting 52 from both sides of the equation:   -52 = 26*t 3. Solve for t: Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 26 to get the value of t:   -52 / 26 = t   t = -2 So, the answer to the equation 0 = 26*t - 0*t + 52 is t = -2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Simple Steps to a Healthier Lifestyle: Reducing Alcohol, Caffeine, Nicotine, and Stress Introduction In today's fast-paced world, people often look for quick fixes to handle life's challenges. As a result, many turn to alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine to relax or stay alert, and the overwhelming demands of daily life lead to increased stress levels. However, long-term reliance on these substances and an inability to cope with stress can have detrimental effects on one's overall health. The simple steps we outline below can help improve your well-being and enable you to lead a healthier lifestyle. 1. Reducing Alcohol Consumption According to health experts, excessive alcohol consumption is associated with several health risks, including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and even some cancers. Furthermore, alcohol can negatively impact mental health, leading to depression and anxiety. To reduce alcohol consumption, consider: - Setting a weekly limit for alcohol consumption - Having alcohol-free days - Choosing non-alcoholic alternatives when socializing - Drinking slowly and alternating alcoholic beverages with water 2. Cutting Down on Caffeine Caffeine, commonly found in coffee, tea, and energy drinks, can be both beneficial and harmful. While it can increase alertness, it can also lead to insomnia, anxiety, and other health issues. To cut down on caffeine: - Gradually reduce your intake over time to avoid withdrawal symptoms - Opt for decaffeinated versions of your favorite beverages - Try alternative beverages, such as herbal teas or flavored water - Be aware of hidden sources of caffeine, such as chocolate and some medications 3. Avoiding Nicotine Nicotine, found in cigarettes and other tobacco products, is highly addictive and can cause various health problems, including lung cancer and heart disease. To avoid nicotine, you may: - Set a quit date and create a plan to help you quit - Utilize nicotine replacement therapy options, such as patches or gum - Seek support from friends, family, or a support group - Identify triggers that make you crave nicotine and develop strategies to handle them 4. Reducing Stress Managing stress is essential for a healthy lifestyle, as chronic stress can lead to physical and mental health problems. To reduce stress: - Identify the sources of stress in your life and work on eliminating or altering them - Prioritize self-care by eating well, exercising regularly, and getting sufficient sleep - Incorporate relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga into your routine - Seek social support from friends, family, or support groups Conclusion By taking small, manageable steps to reduce alcohol consumption, cut down on caffeine, avoid nicotine, and manage stress, you can significantly improve your overall health. These changes will not only benefit your physical and mental well-being but also enhance your quality of life. Remember that progress might be slow, but every step counts towards a healthier, happier you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie plot: Raj Khanna (Hrithik Roshan), Pooja Sahani (Rani Mukherjee) and Tina Kapoor (Kareena Kapoor) are childhood friends. While Raj has always been attracted to the vivacious and beautiful Tina, he is completely unaware of the quiet Pooja's love for him. Raj's father (Kiran Kumar) decides to move to England with his family to take up a new job. Before leaving, Raj makes Tina promise to write to him via e-mail. But Tina soon becomes occupied with other things, so it's the loyal Pooja who writes to Raj with Tina's name to help Tina keep her promise. Raj and Pooja have many things in common, and their e-mails bring them close to each other. A decade and a half later, Raj returns to India for a short vacation. By now, he's in love with the girl he has been writing to, and believes he can recognize her at first sight. When the three of them finally meet, Raj, to Pooja's disappointment, completely ignores her and is besotted with Tina, who is as vivacious as ever. However, during the two weeks of his vacation, he cannot help but notice that the real Tina is completely different from the Tina he knew from the e-mails. He also starts to like Pooja, without realizing she is the one he is really in love with. He returns to London, where Pooja coincidentally arrives for an interview, and there he discovers that Pooja was the one who had been writing to him all those years. They confess their love for each other and decide to get married, but fate plays an unexpected trick on them. Back in India, Tina's father (Sachin Khedekar) has died, leaving Tina alone in the world. Pooja now refuses to marry Raj, as she does not want to break Tina's heart. Raj's parents also agree to the marriage, but Raj wants to tell them that he really loves Pooja. Pooja, however, still refuses to marry Raj and so he angrily vows to her that he will only marry Tina if Pooja marries someone else on the same day. Enter a friend of Raj, Rohan Verma (Uday Chopra).

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: The dumbest thing that actually worked? I joined Tinder. Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

The situation makes Latoya feel sad.","output":"Based on the given sentence \\"The situation makes Latoya feel sad.\\", the emotion in the sentence can be classified as 'sadness'. To provide further information on this classification task, here's a detailed breakdown of how you could approach classifying emotions in sentences, using the adverb as a clue: 1. Identify the targeted adverb: In the example given, 'sad' is the adverb, which indicates the emotion being expressed. The sentence doesn't contain any other adverbs that could alter the emotion's interpretation. 2. Determine the emotion associated with the adverb: With the targeted adverb ('sad') identified, it can be associated with a primary emotion: 'sadness'.  3. Match the emotion to the appropriate class: Now that you have determined that the adverb indicates 'sadness,' you can classify the emotion accordingly. In this case, the sentence can be assigned the class 'sadness'. Note that this method mainly focuses on the adverb for classification, but it is essential to consider the context and other words in the sentence as well. In more complex sentences, adjectives, verbs, and nouns could also provide valuable clues for correctly classifying the emotion.

In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in this process is actually linked with the detection of low blood sugar levels in the body. Thus, the start of the process should be: \\"The body identifies that the blood glucose levels have dropped below the necessary level.\\" Here's why: In your list, the first step mentioned - the release of glucagon by cells in the pancreas - is actually a response to a previous event: low blood sugar level. When the body's blood glucose level drops (for instance, because it's been a while since the last meal or due to vigorous physical activity), this decreased level is detected by the alpha cells in the pancreas.  This detection is essential as it cues the rest of the process. Once these alpha cells in the pancreas have sensed that blood sugar levels are too low (hypoglycemia), they react by releasing the hormone glucagon. Thus, the detection of low blood sugar levels should be the actual first step in this sequence. Patterned out fully, it would be as follows: 1. The body identifies that the blood glucose levels have dropped below the necessary level. 2. Cells in the pancreas, specifically alpha cells, sense the drop in glucose levels.  3. These pancreatic cells respond to this detected hypoglycemia by releasing glucagon.  4. The liver in response, turns the glucagon back into glucose in a process known as glycogenolysis.  5. The liver then releases this newly formed glucose back into the bloodstream. 6. As a result of this release, the blood sugar levels in the body are restored to their normal ranges.  This intricate process is a part of the body’s effort to maintain homeostasis, or relative stability of the internal environment of the body, including the concentration of glucose in the blood."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Public expenditures for education are far below the European Union average as well. Educational standards were once high, but have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. Although average literacy stands at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes, functional illiteracy is significant. The PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. The Ministry of Education and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. Education in primary and secondary public schools is free and compulsory. The process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level.

As well as Russell, the family had two other boys (William \\"Bill\\" and Warren ) and three girls (Madonna, Mabel Ann and Phyllis). He was given the name Wanbli Ohitika by his mother, which means \\"Brave Eagle\\" in the Lakota language. In the 1980s, AIM divided into several competing factions, in part over differences among members regarding support for the indigenous peoples in Nicaragua. Means supported the Miskito group MISURASATA (later known as YATAMA), which was allied with the Contras. He traveled to Nicaragua in 1985 and 1986 on fact-finding tours. He came to believe that the Miskito as a people were being targeted for elimination. Some AIM members supported the Sandinistas of the national government, although they had forced removal of thousands of Miskito from their traditional territory. At that time, the \\"Grand Governing Council\\" of AIM, based in Minnesota, asked Means to cease representing himself as a leader of AIM. Other chapters of AIM continued to support Means.  On January 8, 1988, Means held a press conference to announce his retirement from AIM, saying it had achieved its goals. That January, the \\"AIM Grand Governing Council\\", headed by the Bellecourt brothers, released a press release noting this was the sixth resignation by Means since 1974, and asking the press to \\"never again report either that he is a founder of the American Indian Movement, or [that] he is a leader of the American Indian Movement\\". The \\"AIM General Governing Council\\" noted there were many open issues and legislation regarding Native Americans for which they were continuing to work.  In 1993, the organization divided officially into two main factions: \\"AIM Grand Governing Council\\", based in Minnesota, which copyrighted the name; and American Indian Movement of Colorado, based in Colorado and allied with Means. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Where was the AIM located or based in?","output":"The AIM, or American Indian Movement, had different locations. There was the \\"AIM Grand Governing Council\\" based in Minnesota, and another part called the American Indian Movement of Colorado, which was based in Colorado."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: brunch, dinner, fast food restaurant, appear appetizing, plate  Why is \\"dinner\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Dinner\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the meal that people typically consume in the evening. Out of the given options, dinner is the standard term used to describe an evening meal, making it the most sensible choice. Let's examine the other options to explain why they are not appropriate answers: 1. Brunch: Brunch is a combination of breakfast and lunch, usually enjoyed late in the morning or early in the afternoon. It does not correspond to an evening meal, so it is not a suitable answer. 2. Fast food restaurant: A fast food restaurant is a type of establishment where customers can purchase prepared food quickly, often as takeout or dine-in. It is not a meal itself; instead, it is a place that serves various types of meals, such as lunch or dinner. Therefore, it is not an appropriate answer. 3. Appear appetizing: This phrase describes the visual appeal of a dish, indicating whether it looks enticing and delicious. It is not the name of a meal, making it an incorrect answer. 4. Plate: A plate is an item on which food is served, rather than a specific meal. It is a physical object, not a term for an evening meal, so it is not the correct choice of answer.

Premise: \\"If you know of nothing to the contrary, pursued Mr. Wells, \\"I had thought of Friday. \\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Mr Wells said he was considering Friday.\\"?","output":"To determine whether the given premise entails the hypothesis \\"Mr. Wells said he was considering Friday\\", let's break down the premise and hypothesis step-by-step and justify the connection between them. Step 1: Understand the premise Premise: \\"If you know of nothing to the contrary, pursued Mr. Wells, \\"I had thought of Friday.\\" This statement suggests that Mr. Wells has considered Friday for some purpose, but he is asking if there's any reason not to choose it. In other words, he's open to other suggestions if there are any objections. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis Hypothesis: \\"Mr. Wells said he was considering Friday.\\" This statement simply asserts that Mr. Wells mentioned the possibility of choosing Friday for some purpose. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Both the premise and the hypothesis involve Mr. Wells talking about considering Friday for some purpose. The main difference is the context - in the premise, he's asking if there are any objections to Friday; while in the hypothesis, it's just a statement about him mentioning the consideration of Friday. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis In this case, the premise does entail the hypothesis because, according to the premise, Mr. Wells has indeed considered Friday and mentioned it in his statement. It does not matter in the hypothesis if he was open to objections or not - the main point is that he was considering Friday, which is confirmed by the premise.  To conclude, the premise \\"If you know of nothing to the contrary, pursued Mr. Wells, \\"I had thought of Friday\\" entails the hypothesis \\"Mr. Wells said he was considering Friday\\" because both statements involve Mr. Wells mentioning that he considered Friday for a particular purpose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose a space race starts with another country happens, how will it affect fewer satellites are made.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"B: less If a space race starts with another country, it could lead to fewer satellites being made for a variety of reasons: 1. Resources and focus: A space race usually involves competition between countries to achieve superior space technology and exploration milestones. As a result, resources and focus may shift away from satellite production and more towards other space exploration technologies (e.g., space stations, manned missions, lunar exploration, etc.). 2. Budget allocation: Governments involved in a space race may allocate a larger portion of their budgets to competing in the race instead of investing in satellite manufacturing, leading to a reduction in the number of satellites being developed and launched. 3. Skilled workforce: Skilled engineers, scientists, and other professionals who typically work on satellite development may be redirected to focus on the projects associated with the space race. With fewer experts working on satellite projects, the development and production of satellites may slow down. 4. Prioritization: Countries involved in a space race might prioritize achieving specific goals related to the competition, such as putting astronauts on the moon or developing new spacecraft technology. In this case, satellite development may take a back seat as the country tries to outdo its competitor in other areas of space research and exploration. However, it's essential to consider that the answer could vary depending on the nature of the space race and the goals of the countries involved. If satellite technology plays a significant role in the competition, the number of satellites being made might not necessarily decrease or could even increase to gain an advantage over the rival country."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City. The college's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it. The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition. Columbia University's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates is named the Alexander Hamilton Society.

Information:  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Gregory III Laham (born Lutfy Laham, December 15, 1933, in Darayya, Syria), Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, and Alexandria and Jerusalem, is the spiritual leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, elected on November 29, 2000, succeeding Patriarch Maximos V Hakim.  - Athanasius IV Ignace Michael Jawhar ( or Jahouar or Jauhar or Giohar , 1733 -- 1794 ) was Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church from 1788 to 1794 . He previously claimed to be patriarch from 1759 to 1764 and from 1765 to 1768 .  - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name.  - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus.  - The Melkite (Greek) Catholic Church (\\"\\") is an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Holy See as part of the worldwide Catholic Church. The Melkites, Byzantine Rite Catholics of mixed Eastern Mediterranean (Levantine) and Greek origin, trace their history to the early Christians of Antioch, formerly part of Syria and now in Turkey, of the 1st century AD, where Christianity was introduced by Saint Peter. It is headed by \\"His Beatitude\\" Patriarch Gregory III Laham.  - The Holy See  is the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome, the episcopal see of the Pope, and an independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the Catholic Church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the 1st century during the apostolic era, when Saint Peter arrived in Rome to evangelise and formed a significant early Christian community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean.

How to remove moles without surgery  Make an appointment with a dermatologist.  Going about mole removal the safe way is a decision you won't regret. It's extremely important to have your mole examined by a professional rather than trying to remove it yourself, even if you just want it removed for cosmetic reasons. Select from: a). When you see a physician, he or she will be able to tell whether the mole is potentially cancerous. If it is, professional removal is the only safe method, since other methods won't adequately deal with the cancer cells.; b). Your dermatologist will prescribe you treatment and recommend treatments that you could try. In the first few months of treatment, your acne should go away on its own.; c). Tell a particular doctor if you have had a mole before. They can provide you with advice regarding how to improve on your mole if you decide you want to leave it alone for a certain amount of time.; d). Undergoing a mole removal can affect the outcome of your mole's beauty. Talk to a dermatologist about this appointment so you can make sure the treatment will go without a hitch.; Answer:","output":"a) When you see a physician, he or she will be able to tell whether the mole is potentially cancerous. If it is, professional removal is the only safe method, since other methods won't adequately deal with the cancer cells. In addition to assessing whether the mole is cancerous, the dermatologist will determine the most appropriate procedure for removal depending on the size, location, and type of mole you have. There are several non-surgical methods for removing moles, including cryotherapy, laser therapy, and electrosurgery. Cryotherapy involves freezing the mole using liquid nitrogen. The extreme cold will cause the mole to die and eventually fall off. This method is fast and straightforward, but there could be a risk of scarring or discoloration of your skin. The dermatologist might recommend this method for smaller, non-cancerous moles. Laser therapy uses a high-intensity light beam to break down the cells within the mole. This method is less invasive and has a lower risk of scarring, but it may not be as effective in removing larger moles or those that extend deeper into the skin. Your dermatologist is most likely to opt for this technique if the mole is flat and close to the skin's surface. Electrosurgery involves using an electrical current to burn off the mole. This can be a more effective option for deeper moles, and the dermatologist will carefully control the depth of the burn to minimize scarring and damage to surrounding tissue. A local anesthetic is typically administered to manage pain and discomfort during the procedure. It is essential to follow your dermatologist's advice on aftercare and recovery after the mole removal procedure. Keeping the area clean and protected from infection is crucial, and any signs of infection such as redness, swelling, or increased pain should be reported to your doctor immediately. Remember, choosing the safest and most efficient method for mole removal is crucial for your skin's long-term health. Regardless of your reason for wanting to remove a mole, always seek the advice and guidance of a qualified dermatologist to ensure the best possible outcome and minimize any risks. Your dermatologist is there to support you through the entire process and help you regain confidence in your appearance."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

By Lucy Crossley France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, has agreed to pay around £5.2 billion in compensation to resolve criminal allegations that it breached U.S. trade sanctions against blacklisted countries. After months of negotiations the bank admitted violating sanctions by processing billions of dollars in illegal transactions on behalf of clients in Sudan, Cuba and Iran. The transactions, which prosecutors say were processed through BNP's New York branch office between 2004 and 2012, were handled at the same time as human rights abuses - including the genocide in Sudan - were occurring in those countries. Scroll down for video Compensation: France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, has agreed to pay around £5.2 billion to resolve criminal allegations that it breached U.S. trade sanctions against blacklisted countries The U.S. Justice Department announced yesterday that the bank had admitted state charges in","output":"New York and entered a guilty plea in a federal court in Manhattan, thus finalizing the settlement. As part of the agreement, BNP Paribas will be required to adhere to stringent compliance measures to ensure that such activities do not occur in the future. This includes appointing an independent monitor to review and assess the bank's ongoing sanctions compliance program. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland praised the outcome, stating that the settlement sends a strong message to financial institutions around the world. \\"This outcome demonstrates that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law. Those who engage in illegal activities and undermine our national security will be held accountable,\\" said Garland. The fine, which is one of the largest ever issued against a financial institution, is a significant blow to BNP Paribas. In addition to the monetary penalty, the bank's reputation has been tarnished, potentially causing clients to reconsider their business with the institution. BNP Paribas has also agreed to the temporary suspension of certain U.S. dollar clearing operations, further impacting its competitiveness. Moving forward, the BNP Paribas case is expected to serve as a cautionary tale for other financial institutions that may be tempted to circumvent U.S. trade sanctions. The settlement emphasizes the importance of global cooperation in enforcing sanctions and highlights the need for financial institutions to maintain robust compliance programs to prevent illicit transactions. The bank's chief executive, Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, issued a public apology and expressed his commitment to ensuring that the bank would never again violate U.S. trade sanctions. \\"We deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement. We have learned valuable lessons from this experience and have taken significant steps to strengthen our internal controls and compliance systems,\\" said Bonnafé. The settlement also sparked a broader debate on the effectiveness of such punitive measures in addressing the underlying issues related to sanctions violations. Some critics argued that the large fines could be seen as a simple cost of business for financial institutions, thus doing little to deter future violations. On the other hand, proponents of the settlement argued that it would raise awareness of the consequences of non-compliance and ultimately contribute to a more responsible banking sector. In conclusion, the BNP Paribas case highlights the importance of adhering to U.S. trade sanctions and demonstrates the severe consequences for financial institutions that do not maintain robust compliance programs. The bank's £5.2 billion settlement represents a significant penalty for its past misconduct and has served as a warning to other financial institutions looking to circumvent international regulatory requirements. Going forward, BNP Paribas and other institutions must maintain rigorous internal controls to prevent future sanctions violations and ensure that they can continue to operate globally without significant setbacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: Poulenc made his début as a composer in 1917 with his Rapsodie nègre, a ten-minute, five-movement piece for baritone and chamber group; it was dedicated to Satie and premiered at one of a series of concerts of new music run by the singer Jane Bathori. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This jeu d'esprit was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call \\"leg-Poulenc\\". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot. In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art ... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being. Cocteau, though similar in age to Les Six, was something of a father-figure to the group. His literary style, \\"paradoxical and lapidary\\" in Hell's phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent. It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau's words in 1919 and his last in 1961. When members of Les Six collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite L'Album des Six consists of six separate and unrelated pieces.... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose literary style was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent?, what is it ?

Dance: While some people may dance when they drink alcohol, not everyone does, and it could depend on the environment or individual preferences. B. Become inebriated: Drinking alcohol at a bar is more likely to cause inebriation, but it depends on the amount of alcohol consumed and individual tolerance levels. C. Urinate: Consuming alcohol can lead to increased urination due to its diuretic effects. However, this may not be the most immediate or noticeable result of drinking at a bar. D. Sleep at night: Drinking alcohol can make some people feel drowsy, but this is not directly related to being at a bar and depends on individual reactions to alcohol. E.

Here is an article: IT'S THAT YOU HAVE to look at it, day after day. Most people get up, do their thing and walk out to their car or truck. Maybe it has a place of honor in a multicar garage or maybe it sits bereft in a parking deck as gray as the skies. But there it is. Every morning, the moment recurs when we possess our automobile all over again. That's me, that's my ride. Turdblossum. \\"Man, I need a new car,\\" you think. Which means you have to go to a dealership, which also means you get to be a schmuck. It can't be helped. The following paragraphs constitute all I know about the retail car-buying experience. Consumers make the process needlessly antagonistic and stressful. People come into car dealerships in fits of near-delusional paranoia, convinced that everybody's trying to rip them off. They will wave a printout from Edmunds.com or Kelley Blue Book like it was a machete. They will scream and throw themselves to the ground just to get free floor mats. I dare you: Stand a post for one day in a busy car dealership. The public = nuts. The irony is that many people, begrudging the sales doofus his meager dimes, give away dollars. “Of course you're going to spend the money, because you are only flesh and blood. I'm here to say, it's OK. Give in. Live a little.” Car buyers routinely drive off the lot having spent way more money on wheels, horsepower, seats and audio than they ever intended. And the sales people don't have to do anything but hand over the paperwork. \\"The Audi S7 with the executive rear seating? Yes, sir, Mr. Neil! Right away!\\" Clap, clap! In retail sales, upselling is free money. Meet the King of the Upsell: the 2014 Ford Fiesta ST, a hot-hatch version of the company's megaselling global subcompact, now in its seventh generation. Sure, you walked into the dealership figuring on spending about 15,000 on the base five-door hatchback, but now the sales guy drops the ST on you. Boom! You love it. Because: fun. The ST scampers around town like a randy squirrel. Its 1.6-liter, four cylinder is turbo-boosted to the stars (21 psi) and redlines at over 6,000 rpm. It is shod with overachieving 17-inch Bridgestone Potenzas and—OMG!—it's got an old-school six-speed manual transmission. The Fiesta is one of the world's best-selling cars. Engineered by Ford of Europe, it is basically the official car of every public servant, barmaid and shopkeep in the United Kingdom. Fiesta vacated the U.S. market in 1980 and returned in 2010. Ford moved the tin to the tune of 57,000 sales in 2012. So there is absolutely nothing wrong with the Fiesta in its less highly contented form: seven air bags, heated outside mirrors, Bluetooth and plug-and-play media with voice recognition, power windows and doors with keyless entry. But if you want to stave off long-term ownership ennui, the ST is the way to go. Now, there's a face you could wake up to in the morning. The ST package lowers the ride height a half-inch, stuffs the wheel wells with the big hex-motif alloy rims, and wraps special aero bodywork around the rocker panels, front and rear lower fascia. The blacked out, flush-fit grille and thick eyeliner around the headlamp assemblies actually give the ST a touch of the exotic. The Fiesta ST's taut modernist bod, bandy proportions and unsmiling, on-task visage help it avoid the box-office poison of cuteness. Think of it as a hot-hatch Aston Martin. But the abacus beads have moved, alas: The Fiesta of your dreams costs nearly 25,000, and that's without the sunroof. The optional Recaro partial-leather seat package takes a huge bite (1,995) but the deep, bolstered buckets are so slaggingly futuristic and supportive, you can't give them up. It's nice that the Recaro package also includes heated front seats. The navigation system adds 795. The painted gray 17-inch rims with the thrombo red brake calipers, that's an additional 375. Of course you're going to spend the money, because you are only flesh and blood and because there are favorable lease terms available. I'm here to say, it's OK. Give in. Live a little. As a happy consequence of the company's One Ford global strategy, the U.S. market will get the ST in its full Euro-spec brattiness (the company's past practice with the Focus ST has been to offer North America dialed-down versions). The ST is almost exactly as sold overseas, with the heavy-breathing turbo stoking the all-aluminum 1.6-liter in-line four, whipping up 77 hp more (197 hp) than the base car. Max torque almost doubles, to 214 pound-feet at 3,500 rpm, but the car feels cammy and eager anywhere north of 2,200 rpm. Pin the throttle, grab a gear and the ST (2,742 pounds with the manual) takes off like a hooked trout, chuffing its front tires and flickering the traction-control indicator until you either shift or blow through the fuel cutoff point. The combination of big turbo boost and the small, lightweight crank gives the engine a deep suddenness, an eagerness to spool up. Even at low rpm, the engine pulls, and a sturdy, resonant exhaust note fills the car, a hummingbird on performance-enhancing drugs. In the interests of turbo (and warranty) preservation, the engine-control module dials back maximum boost after 20 seconds, but you need only a light lift of the throttle to reset the turbo timer, so the effect is practically unnoticeable. Shuffling through the short lower gears, drivers will find plenty of use for the car's brake-based torque vectoring on the front axle, helping put more power to the ground when accelerating out of corners. The Fiesta ST's electric steering is satisfyingly responsive, even a wee edgy with a surprising amount of tactile feedback from the front tires. The steering wheel is small and feels racy. The steel foot pedals are right where you want them for heel-and-toe footwork. Driving position is just excellent. The donor car's front-strut, rear-beam suspension has been modified in the expected ways: Damping and spring rates are up, front and rear, with a smaller front antiroll bar putting a little more danciness in the Fiesta's hinder. The Fiesta ST has what you might call entertaining body roll, like an old Alfa. And when the tiny hampster blood boils at 5 grand in this car and she's got a front wheel off the ground, I defy you not to smile. You can dive into a tight 35-mph curve, and when the front tires really start to complain, breathe off the gas gently, and the car will come around with a sweet, catchable trailing-throttle oversteer. When the little hood is pointing in the right direction, lay on the coal. The Fiesta ST claws away like a cat escaping a water pistol. It is all about shelf life. How many times can you walk out to the same car in the morning without being overwhelmed with boredom? The Fiesta ST costs more, but it will keep owners smiling a lot longer. That makes it a bargain.

NEW YORK (CNN) -- A lawsuit filed January 30 by baseball great Roberto Alomar's ex-girlfriend alleges he engaged in unprotected sex with her while suffering from HIV/AIDS. Roberto Alomar's ex-girlfriend says he had unprotected sex with her while infected with HIV. Ilya Dall is asking for 15 million for \\"personal injuries\\" suffered due to Alomar's negligence. She and her two children lived with the former New York Mets slugger for three years. She alleges that he started exhibiting signs of HIV as early as 2005, but twice refused recommendations for an HIV test by his doctor, saying that earlier tests for the disease had come back negative, according to court papers. The couple visited a disease specialist shortly after OPTIONS: - AIDS's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. - Alomar's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. - CNN's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. - HIV's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. - HIV/AIDS's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. - Ilya Dall's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. - NEW YORK's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. - New York Mets's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. - Roberto Alomar's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit.","output":"- Alomar's diagnosis, who found a mass in Alomar's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS, according to the lawsuit. This is the correct answer because it says that the couple visited a disease specialist after Alomar was diagnosed. The specialist found a mass in Alomar's chest and told them that Alomar had AIDS. Now, let me explain why the other options are wrong: - AIDS's diagnosis, CNN's diagnosis, HIV's diagnosis, HIV/AIDS's diagnosis, Ilya Dall's diagnosis, NEW YORK's diagnosis, and New York Mets's diagnosis: These options are wrong because they say that the couple visited a specialist after someone or something else's diagnosis, but the story is about Alomar and his diagnosis. - Roberto Alomar's diagnosis: This option is wrong because it sounds like the specialist found something in Alomar's chest after examining Roberto Alomar's own diagnosis, and that doesn't make sense. The specialist should discover the mass after examining Alomar, not his diagnosis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hoping to add to a three-game winning streak, the Broncos traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina for an interconference match-up with the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium. In the first quarter, the Panthers struck first, with quarterback Cam Newton connecting on a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Greg Olsen. However, the Broncos would reel off 29 unanswered points and dominate the remainder of the game. Quarterback Peyton Manning threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Stokley. The Broncos grabbed the lead in the second quarter, with return specialist Trindon Holliday returning a punt 76 yards for a touchdown, followed by a 53-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, then in the third quarter, cornerback Tony Carter returned an interception off Newton 40 yards for a touchdown. Prater added a 27-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, followed by safety Mike Adams sacking Newton in the end zone for a safety. The Panthers responded in the fourth quarter, with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Newton to Olsen, but the Broncos put the game out of reach, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 5-yard touchdown. The Broncos' defense harassed Cam Newton throughout the game, sacking Newton seven times. This was Broncos' head coach John Fox's first visit to Carolina, where he served as head coach of the Panthers from 2002-2010. Answer this question based on the article: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass than the shortest?","output":"Let me explain it in a simple way: In the article, there are two touchdown passes mentioned. One touchdown pass is 4 yards long, which was thrown by Cam Newton to Greg Olsen. The other touchdown pass is 10 yards long, which was thrown by Peyton Manning to Brandon Stokley. To find out how many yards longer the longest touchdown pass is compared to the shortest, you need to subtract the shorter one from the longer one. So, 10 yards (longest touchdown pass) minus 4 yards (shortest touchdown pass) equals 6 yards.  The longest touchdown pass was 6 yards longer than the shortest one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Here is a question about this article: Critics such as economist Paul Krugman and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner have argued that the regulatory framework did not keep pace with financial innovation, such as the increasing importance of the shadow banking system, derivatives and off-balance sheet financing. A recent OECD study suggest that bank regulation based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis. In other cases, laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system. Key examples include: What is the answer to this question: What accords possibly contributed to or reinforced the financial crisis?","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, the accords that possibly contributed to or reinforced the financial crisis were the Basel Accords. The Basel Accords, specifically Basel I and Basel II, are a set of international banking regulations, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), aimed at ensuring the stability of the global financial system by setting minimum capital requirements for banks and promoting risk management practices. Critics such as Paul Krugman and Timothy Geithner pointed out that the regulatory framework, including the Basel Accords, did not keep pace with financial innovation. These innovations encompassed the increasing importance of the shadow banking system, derivatives, and off-balance-sheet financing. With financial institutions engaging in these complex transactions and activities, the existing regulations were inadequate in controlling and mitigating the risks associated with them. Moreover, the article refers to a recent OECD study suggesting that the bank regulation based on the Basel Accords encouraged unconventional business practices, which contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis. This implies that the Basel regulations may have inadvertently incentivized banks to engage in riskier transactions, leading to financial instability. In addition to the limitations of the Basel Accords, the article mentions that, in some cases, laws were changed or enforcement was weakened in parts of the financial system. As a result, certain financial institutions and activities operated with less oversight, further exacerbating the risks and contributing to the financial crisis. In conclusion, the Basel Accords – particularly Basel I and II – are the accords that possibly contributed to or reinforced the financial crisis, as they failed to adapt to the rapid financial innovations and may have encouraged unconventional business practices. Furthermore, changes in laws and weak enforcement in some areas of the financial system further compounded the crisis. These shortcomings in the regulatory framework highlight the need for ongoing review and improvement in financial regulations in order to maintain global financial stability."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Background: La Strada (lit. \\"The Road\\") is a 1954 Italian drama film directed by Federico Fellini from his own screenplay co-written with Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano. The film portrays a naive young woman (Giulietta Masina) bought from her mother by a brutish strongman (Anthony Quinn) who takes her with him on the road. Fellini has called La Strada \\"a complete catalogue of my entire mythological world, a dangerous representation of my identity that was undertaken with no precedent whatsoever.\\" Context: In later years, Fellini explained that from \\"a sentimental point of view,\\" he was \\"most attached\\" to La Strada: \\"Above all, because I feel that it is my most representative film, the one that is the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film that I had the greatest trouble in realizing and that gave me the most difficulty when it came time to find a producer.\\" Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, \\"especially Zampano.\\" Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: \\"He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then.\\" Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: \\"The two of you are the highest point in my life -- Antonio.\\"  Critic Roger Ebert, in his book The Great Movies, has described the current critical consensus as holding that La Strada was the high point of Fellini's career and that, after this film, \\"his work ran wild through the jungles of Freudian, Christian, sexual and autobiographical excess\\". (Ebert, himself, disagrees, seeing La Strada as \\"part of a process of discovery that led to the masterpieces La Dolce Vita (1960), 8 1/2 (1963) and Amarcord (1974)\\".)  The years since its initial release have solidified the high estimation of La Strada. It holds a 97% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 31 reviewers who, on average, scored it 8.7 on a scale of 10. Its numerous appearances on lists of best films include the 1992 Directors' poll of the British Film Institute (4th best), the New York Times \\"Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\\", and the \\"Greatest Films\\" list of They Shoot Pictures, Don't They (# 67) - a website that statistically calculates the most well-received movies.  In 1995, the Catholic Church's Pontifical Commission for Social Communications issued a list of 45 films representing a \\"...cross section of outstanding films, chosen by a committee of twelve international movie scholars.\\" This has come to be known as the Vatican film list, and includes La Strada as one of 15 films in the sub-category labeled Art. Pope Francis, has said it is \\"the movie that perhaps I loved the most,\\" because of his personal identification with its implicit reference to his namesake, Francis of Assisi. Question: What else did Quinn say or feel about La Strada? Answer:","output":"Anthony Quinn felt that working with Federico Fellini on La Strada was an invaluable experience that taught him a lot about film acting. He said, \\"He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then.\\" Additionally, in a note he sent to Fellini and his co-star Giulietta Masina in 1990, Quinn expressed his deep affection for them, calling them the highest point of his life: \\"The two of you are the highest point in my life -- Antonio.\\" Overall, it is evident that Quinn held La Strada and the experience of working on the film in high regard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which has a weaker gravity (A) balloon (B) ball Answer:","output":"To determine the correct answer, we need to evaluate the relationship between the objects and gravity: Step 1: Identify the properties of each object. - Balloon: It will float in the air when released, indicating it is filled with a lighter-than-air gas such as helium. - Ball: It will fall to the ground when released, indicating it has mass and is affected by gravity. Step 2: Understand how gravity works. - Gravity is a force that attracts two objects with mass towards each other. The more massive an object is, the more it experiences the force of gravity. Step 3: Compare the objects in terms of their relationship with gravity. - Balloon: Since it floats, it means the buoyant force created by the lighter-than-air gas inside it is stronger than the force of gravity acting on it. - Ball: The force of gravity acting on the ball is stronger, causing it to fall to the ground when released. Step 4: Determine the answer based on the comparison. Since the balloon floats in the air, it means that it experiences a weaker gravity compared to the ball which falls to the ground.

Write an email with the subject line \\"CGAS Email\\".","output":"Subject: CGAS Email Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is [Your Name], and I am getting in touch with you regarding a Collaborative Group Activities and Strategies (CGAS) proposal that I am eager to present to you. After reviewing the objectives of our team, it has come to my attention that we could benefit from implementing a more collaborative and structured approach to our group activities. Firstly, I would like to take a moment to praise our team for its existing efforts and progress in our projects thus far. Your dedication and hard work are greatly appreciated. Despite the progress we have made, I have identified a few areas in which we can enhance our group's productivity and efficiency through the integration of CGAS. By adopting a more interactive approach to problem-solving and decision-making, we will establish an environment that fosters creativity, enhances communication, and ultimately leads to improved results. To begin with, I propose implementing the following strategies to facilitate greater collaboration and dynamism within our team: 1. Regular brainstorming sessions: Holding predetermined brainstorm sessions can help unlock new ideas, promote creativity, and encourage team members to take on fresh perspectives. These sessions should be held in a comfortable setting and include meaningful discussions that contribute to the development of innovative approaches to achieving our goals. 2. Team-building exercises: It is essential to strengthen the interpersonal relationships within our team members. Through team-building exercises and activities, we can create an atmosphere of trust, respect, and open communication that can ultimately lead to better decision-making and a more united front in achieving our common goals. 3. Designating sub-teams and roles: By assigning specific roles and responsibilities to smaller sub-teams, we can ensure better organization and a more focused approach to tackling tasks, leading to greater efficiency and more tangible results. 4. Encouraging knowledge sharing: Promote a culture of learning and continuous development among team members by encouraging knowledge sharing through structured presentations, workshops, and webinars. This will not only benefit individuals' career growth but also contribute greatly to the collective knowledge and skills of the entire team. 5. Review and feedback sessions: Regularly assess our collaborative efforts by conducting review and feedback sessions where team members can provide constructive feedback, evaluations, and improvement suggestions. These sessions can help identify potential pitfalls early on, encouraging continuation or adaptation of promising strategies. I understand that implementing these strategies might require time and energy from every member on the team. However, I truly believe that by embracing these CGAS methods, our team will thrive and enhance overall productivity while fostering a positive, collaborative work environment. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss these strategies further with you and the team at your earliest convenience. Please let me know if there is an upcoming team meeting or any other suitable occasion where we can present this proposal. Your feedback and insights will be invaluable in fine-tuning the implementation of these collaborative approaches. Thank you very much for your attention, I look forward to your thoughts on this matter.

A Jewish barber saves the life of a wounded pilot, Schultz (Reginald Gardiner), but loses his own memory through concussion.     Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel Twenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the barber escapes from his care-home to return to the ghetto. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who looks like an identical twin of the barber (both played by Chaplin). The barber falls in love with a neighbor's daughter Hannah (Paulette Goddard), and together they try to resist persecution by storm troopers. The storm troopers capture the barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz remembers that the barber had saved his life during the war, and restrains them. Hynkel tries to finance his military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy, and is removed from office and sent to a concentration camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to mount an assassination attempt against Hynkel, but they sensibly decline to participate in his violent plan. Stormtroopers search the ghetto, arresting Schultz and the barber. They are sent to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom in the neighboring country of Osterlich. Hynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Napaloni (a spoof of Mussolini played by Jack Oakie), over which country should invade Osterlich. After signing a treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel invades Osterlich. The Jewish family is trapped by the invading force. Escaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel.

He says that \\"an incandescent light bulb converts electricity into light by sending electricity through a filament\\" and \\"additional electricity is stored in the battery\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"Given the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the quiz question \\"What can convert battery energy into light?\\" is an \\"Incandescent Light Bulb.\\" The incandescent light bulb operates by converting electricity into light through the process of sending electricity through a filament. When the electric current passes through the filament, the filament gets heated up to a high temperature, and it starts emitting light. This process is also known as incandescence, which is the emission of light from a hot body as a result of its high temperature. The battery serves as a source of electrical energy, storing the electrical potential which can be used to generate a current. When connected to an incandescent light bulb, the battery’s stored electrical energy is released and converted into light by the filament. This conversion is possible due to the resistive heating effect of the filament, where electrical energy is transformed into thermal energy, and then subsequently into light energy. It is important to note that incandescent light bulbs are not the only method to convert battery energy into light, but considering the information provided by the teacher, it is the best answer for this particular question. Other forms of light-emitting devices that can convert stored battery energy into light include LED lights, fluorescent lights, and halogen lamps, all of which operate through unique mechanisms and have their own advantages and disadvantages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? By Mark Prigg The Federal Communications Commission has launched a major probe into why US consumers often suffer with slow internet connection while watching online video. The inquiry announced by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will dissect the routes that video and other data travel to reach Internet service providers such as Comcast and Verizon. Netflix and other critics have accused the two Internet service providers of deliberately slowing incoming traffic from websites unwilling to pay for a less congested entry point. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler today pledged to unravel the mystery behind the Internet traffic jams bogging down the delivery of Netflix videos and other online content. Verizon reaffirmed its support for the status quo and pointed out that '","output":"Verizon reaffirmed its support for the status quo and pointed out that 'it adheres strictly to the principles of net neutrality, providing equal data transfer rates to all its clients without discrimination.' It also emphasized that any perceived slow speed may be due to an individual's internet package or peak time congestion, denying any involvement in the purported manipulation of internet speeds.  My approach for completing this passage is based on potential responses from companies like Verizon in real scenarios. In conflict situations like these, corporations often restate their adherence to established principles, in this case, net neutrality. Also, they tend to shift the blame to other elements that are out of their control like the consumer's internet package or peak traffic times. By making these implications, Verizon is indirectly denying allegations of deliberately slowing down internet speeds.

To see the chemistry concepts in practice he conducted two tests, test A and test B. In test A he used two liquid reactants evenly dispersed, but in test B he used one liquid reactant and one solid reactant. He was surprised to see that two tests had very different results.  and a hint : Many reactions take place in solution or in the gas phase, where the reactants are evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture. However, for reactions in which one of the reactants is a pure solid or liquid (meaning that this reactant is not already mixed together with any other reactants), reactivity only occurs at the surface, where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants. All of the molecules or ions in the interior of the pure substance will not be colliding with the other necessary reactants, so they are not really contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. However, increasing the surface area will increase the frequency of potentially reactive collisions, because more reactant particles will be in contact with the other necessary reactants.  Please answer this question : In which test more reactant particles would be in contact with other reactants, test A or test B? Answer:","output":"In test A, more reactant particles would be in contact with other reactants. This is because both reactants are in the liquid phase, which allows them to be evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture. Consequently, the molecules or ions in the liquid reactants have a greater likelihood of interacting and colliding with the other necessary reactants, thus contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. In contrast, test B has one liquid and one solid reactant, which means that reactivity only occurs at the surface where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants.

Q:Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left.  Question: suppose more finish stays on happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If more finish stays on the wood, it will have a LESS effect on weathering occurring. This is because the finish acts as a protective layer to the wood, preventing rain from seeping into the wood surface as quickly and efficiently as it would without the finish. The supposed perturbation reduces the second effect mentioned, which is the loss of luster and the wood looking bad, as a greater amount of finish remaining on the wood will provide better protection against rain and other weather elements.

You'll get sick if you eat the brown bread but not the white bread because the","output":"brown bread contains a specific ingredient that has been linked to causing adverse reactions in some people. In order to understand why this occurs, let's break down the process step-by-step. Step 1: Identifying the problem ingredient First, we must identify which ingredient in the brown bread is causing the issue. The main components of brown bread are whole wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt. Other ingredients may vary depending on the recipe, but these four are considered the foundational elements. In this case, the problematic ingredient is likely the whole wheat flour since it differentiates brown bread from white bread. Step 2: Analyzing the issue with whole wheat flour Whole wheat flour is made from the entire wheat kernel, including the bran (outer layer), endosperm (middle layer), and germ (innermost part). This composition provides additional nutritional value such as fiber and essential vitamins. However, for some people, the additional components in whole wheat flour can cause digestive issues or allergic reactions. Step 3: Examining potential reasons for adverse reactions One possible reason for an adverse reaction to brown bread might be gluten sensitivity or intolerance. Gluten is a protein found in wheat and other grains, and some individuals may have difficulty digesting it. Another possibility is an allergy to one of the other components in whole wheat flour, such as the proteins found in the bran or germ. Step 4: Comparing brown bread to white bread White bread is made from refined wheat flour, which has the bran and germ removed. This means that there is less gluten and fewer proteins from the whole wheat kernel in white bread, making it more easily digestible for some people. As a result, those who experience discomfort or an allergic reaction after consuming brown bread may not have the same issues with white bread. Step 5: Recommending alternative options For individuals who cannot tolerate brown bread, there are several alternatives available, such as gluten-free bread, rice bread, or bread made from alternative grains like quinoa and amaranth. These options can provide the same satisfaction as traditional bread while reducing or eliminating the risk of getting sick from its consumption. In conclusion, eating brown bread can lead to sickness in some individuals due to its higher gluten content and additional proteins found in whole wheat flour. This issue is not present with white bread, as it contains fewer of these potentially problematic ingredients. If you're sensitive to gluten or have an allergy, opt for white bread or try alternative bread options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are several reasons for this rating. Firstly, both sentences mention women or girls sitting on a bench. This indicates the same general setting and positioning of the subjects in both sentences. Additionally, both sentences mention an inflatable tiger being held by one of the females. This is a specific and unique similarity that cannot be disregarded. However, there are some differences between the two sentences which prevent them from being rated as very similar (5 out of 5). The first sentence specifically says \\"two women,\\" while the second sentence says \\"a girl\\" and \\"another girl.\\" This difference in wording could imply a difference in age or maturity between the women/girls in the two sentences.  The second sentence also says that the other girl is in a \\"colorful outfit,\\" while the first sentence specifies that she is in a \\"Disney Snow White costume.\\" Although a Snow White costume could be considered a colorful outfit, the distinction between the two descriptions suggests that the second sentence's description is less specific. Finally, the first sentence adds the detail of their faces being obscured, while the second sentence does not mention this aspect. This difference in detail further separates the two sentences. In conclusion, the two sentences have a considerable degree of similarity, featuring a shared setting and specific elements such as the inflatable tiger. However, the differences in the descriptions of the females, as well as the additional detail of obscured faces in the first sentence, prevent the similarity rating from being a perfect 5 out of 5.

In the ruling dynasties and noble families of much of Europe and Asia, the family's major assetsrealm, titles, fiefs, property and incomehave historically been passed from a father to his firstborn son in what is known as primogeniture; younger sonscadetsinherited less wealth and authority to pass to future generations of descendants.  - Philippa of Hainault (24 June 1314  15 August 1369) was Queen of England as the wife of King Edward III. Edward, Duke of Guyenne, her future husband, promised in 1326 to marry her within the following two years. She was married to Edward, first by proxy, when Edward dispatched the Bishop of Coventry \\"to marry her in his name\\" in Valenciennes (second city in importance of the county of Hainaut) in October 1327. The marriage was celebrated formally in York Minster on 24 January 1328, some months after Edward's accession to the throne of England. In August 1328, he also fixed his wife's dower.  - Earl of Derby is a title in the Peerage of England. The title was first adopted by Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby under a creation of 1139. It continued with the Ferrers family until the 6th Earl forfeited his property toward the end of the reign of Henry III and died in 1279. Most of the Ferrers property and, by a creation in 1337, the Derby title, were then held by the family of Henry III. The title merged in the Crown upon Henry IV's accession to the throne.  - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.  - A duke (male) (British English: or American English: ) or duchess (female) can either be a monarch ruling over a duchy or a member of the nobility, historically of highest rank below the monarch. The title comes from French \\"duc\\", itself from the Latin \\"dux\\", 'leader', a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province.  - Anjou is an historical and cultural region of France, a former French county (in that it was ruled by a count, from ), duchy (1360), and province. Its capital was the city of Angers in the lower Loire Valley. The territory has no very clear geographical borders but instead owes its territory and prominence to the fortunes of its various rulers.  - The Duchy of Lancaster is, since 1399, the private estate of the British sovereign as Duke of Lancaster. The principal purpose of the estate is to provide a source of independent income to the Sovereign. The estate consists of a portfolio of lands, properties, and assets held in trust for the Sovereign, and is administered separately from the Crown Estate. The duchy consists of of land holdings (including rural estates and farmland), urban developments, historic buildings, and some commercial properties across England and Wales, particularly in Cheshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Savoy Estate in London. The Duchy of Lancaster is one of two royal duchies: the other is the Duchy of Cornwall, which provides income to the Prince of Wales.  - The Duke of Lancaster is an ancient title which is currently held by Elizabeth II, who is also the Monarch of the United Kingdom. The Duchy of Lancaster exists as a separate entity from the Crown Estate and currently provides income for the British monarch.  - The Crown Estate is a collection of lands and holdings in the United Kingdom belonging to the British monarch as a corporation sole, making it the \\"Sovereign's public estate\\", which is neither government property nor part of the monarch's private estate. As a result of this arrangement, the sovereign is not involved with the management or administration of the estate, exercising only very limited control of its affairs. Instead, the estate's extensive portfolio is overseen by a semi-independent, incorporated public body headed by the Crown Estate Commissioners, who exercise \\"the powers of ownership\\" of the estate, although they are not \\"owners in their own right\\". The revenues from these hereditary possessions have been placed by the monarch at the disposition of Her Majesty's Government and thus proceed directly to Her Majesty's Treasury for the benefit of the British nation. The Crown Estate is formally accountable to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, where it is legally mandated to make an annual report to the sovereign, a copy of which is forwarded to the House of Commons.  - Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926) has been Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand since 6 February 1952. She is Head of the Commonwealth and Queen of 12 countries that have become independent since her accession: Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.  - John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, (6 March 1340  3 February 1399) was a member of the House of Plantagenet, the third of five surviving sons of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. He was called \\"John of Gaunt\\" because he was born in Ghent, then rendered in English as \\"Gaunt\\". When he became unpopular later in life, scurrilous rumours and lampoons circulated that he was actually the son of a Ghent butcher, perhaps because Edward III was not present at the birth. This story always drove him to fury.  - The title of Earl of Lancaster was created in the Peerage of England in 1267, merging in the crown in 1399. It was succeeded by the Duke of Lancaster. The title was created when Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancasterfrom which the house was namedfor his second son Edmund Crouchback in 1267. Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, after de Montfort's death and attainder at the end of the Second Barons' War. When Edmund's son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, inherited his father-in-law's estates and title of Earl of Lincoln he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels. This brought himand Henry, his younger brotherinto conflict with their cousin Edward II of England, leading to Thomas's execution. Henry inherited Thomas's titles and he and his son, who was also called Henry, gave loyal service to Edward's sonEdward III of England.  - The Hundred Years' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the House of Plantagenet, rulers of the Kingdom of England, against the House of Valois, rulers of the Kingdom of France, over the succession of the French throne. Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages, in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe. The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong national identities in both countries.  - Blanche of Lancaster ( 25 March 1345 -- 12 September 1368 ) was a member of the English royal House of Plantagenet , daughter of the kingdom 's wealthiest and most powerful peer , Henry of Grosmont , 1st Duke of Lancaster . She was the first wife of John of Gaunt , the mother of King Henry IV , and the grandmother of King Henry V of England .  - Ghent  is a city and a municipality in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is the capital and largest city of the East Flanders province and after Antwerp the largest municipality of Belgium. The city started as a settlement at the confluence of the Rivers Scheldt and Leie and in the Late Middle Ages became one of the largest and richest cities of northern Europe, with some 50,000 people in 1300. It is a port and university city.  - Edward III (13 November 1312  21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 until his death; he is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, Edward II. Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of fifty years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and governmentin particular the evolution of the English parliamentas well as the ravages of the Black Death.  - Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, 4th Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, KG (c. 1310  23 March 1361), also Earl of Derby, was a member of the English nobility in the 14th century, and a prominent English diplomat, politician, and soldier. The son and heir of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, and Maud Chaworth, he became one of Edward III's most trusted captains in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War and distinguished himself with victory in the Battle of Auberoche.

Q:Information:  - Valdivia Province is one of two provinces of the southern Chilean region of Los Ríos (XIV). The provincial capital is Valdivia. Located in the province are two important rivers, the Calle-Calle / Valdivia River and the Cruces River.It is part of Northern Patagonia and its wild virgin forest embrace the Patagonian Cordillera following the river Calle Calle down to the Pacific Ocean. It is known in Patagonia the term \\"Bosque Valdiviano\\" referring to the primitive forest of Valdivia with its native trees. These forests are present in some parts of Northern Patagonia, both in Chile and Argentina.  - Aquatic and semiaquatic mammals are a diverse group of mammals that dwell partly or entirely in bodies of water. They include the various marine mammals who dwell in oceans, as well as various freshwater species, such as the European otter. They are not a taxon and are not unified by any distinct biological grouping, but rather their dependence on and integral relation to aquatic ecosystems. The level of dependence on aquatic life are vastly different among species, with the Amazonian manatee and river dolphins being completely aquatic and fully dependent on aquatic ecosystems; whereas the Baikal seal feeds underwater but rests, molts, and breeds on land; and the capybara and hippopotamus are able to venture in and out of water in search of food.  - Los Lagos Region (literally \\"Region of the Lakes\\") is one of Chile's 15 regions, which are first order administrative divisions, and comprises four provinces: Chiloé, Llanquihue, Osorno and Palena. The region contains the country's second largest island, Chiloé, and the second largest lake, Llanquihue.  - The XIV Los Ríos Region (Spanish: \\"XIV Región de Los Ríos\\", literally in English: \\"XIV Region of the Rivers\\") is one of Chile's 15 regions, the country's first-order administrative divisions. Its capital is Valdivia. It began to operate as a region on October 2, 2007, having been created by subdividing the Los Lagos Region in southern Chile. It consists of two provinces: Valdivia and the newly created Ranco Province, which was formerly part of Valdivia Province.  - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.  - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Forestry is the science and craft of creating, managing, using, conserving, and repairing forests and associated resources to meet desired goals, needs, and values for human and environment benefits. Forestry is practiced in plantations and natural stands. The science of forestry has elements that belong to the biological, physical, social, political and managerial sciences.  - Valdivia is a city and commune in southern Chile, administered by the Municipality of Valdivia. The city is named after its founder Pedro de Valdivia and is located at the confluence of the Calle-Calle, Valdivia, and Cau-Cau Rivers, approximately east of the coastal towns of Corral and Niebla. Since October 2007, Valdivia has been the capital of Los Ríos Region and is also the capital of Valdivia Province. The national census of 2002 census recorded the commune of Valdivia as having 140,559 inhabitants (\\"Valdivianos\\"), of whom 127,750 were living in the city. The main economic activities of Valdivia include tourism, wood pulp manufacturing, forestry, metallurgy, and beer production. The city is also the home of the Austral University of Chile, founded in 1954, and the Centro de Estudios Científicos.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - The Fort System of Valdivia are a series of Spanish colonial fortifications at Corral Bay, Valdivia and Cruces River established to protect the city of Valdivia, in southern Chile. During the period of Spanish rule (15521820), it was one of the biggest systems of fortification in the Americas. It was also a major supply source for Spanish ships that crossed the Strait of Magellan.  - Aquaculture, also known as aquafarming, is the farming of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic plants, algae, and other aquatic organisms. Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions, and can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish. Mariculture refers to aquaculture practiced in marine environments and in underwater habitats.  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - Corral is a town , commune and sea port in Los Ríos Region , Chile . It is located south of Corral Bay . Corral is best known for the forts of Corral Bay , a system of defensive batteries and forts made to protect Valdivia during colonial times . Corral was the headquarters of the system . Economic activities in Corral revolve around forestry , aquaculture , fishing , port services and both heritage and eco tourism .  - Austral University of Chile (or UACh) is a research university in Chile based in Valdivia although it has some institutions and careers in Puerto Montt. Founded by decree on 7 September 1954 it is one of the eight original Chilean Traditional Universities. Juridically it is a nonprofit self-owned corporation under private law and is significantly state-financed.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.  - A craft is a pastime or a profession that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. In a historical sense, particularly as pertinent to the Middle Ages and earlier, the term is usually applied to people occupied in small-scale production of goods, or their maintenance, for example by tinkers. The traditional terms \\"craftsman\\" and \\"craftswoman\\" are nowadays often replaced by \\"artisan\\" and rarely by \\"craftsperson\\" (craftspeople).  - A plantation is a large piece of land (or water) where one crop is specifically planted for widespread commercial sale and usually tended by resident laborers. The crops grown include fast-growing trees (often conifers), cotton,  coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar cane, sisal, oil seeds (e.g. oil palms), rubber trees, and various fruits. Protectionist policies and natural comparative advantage have sometimes contributed to determining where plantations were located.  - Commercial fishing is the activity of catching fish and other seafood for commercial profit, mostly from wild fisheries. It provides a large quantity of food to many countries around the earth, but those who practice it as an industry must often pursue fish far into the ocean under adverse conditions. Large-scale commercial fishing is also known as industrial fishing. This profession has gained in popularity with the development of shows such as \\"Deadliest Catch\\", \\"Swords\\", and \\"Wicked Tuna\\". The major fishing industries are not only owned by major corporations but by small families as well. The industry has had to adapt through the years in order to keep earning a profit. A study taken on some small family-owned commercial fishing companies showed that they adapted to continue to earn a living but not necessarily make a large profit. It is the adaptability of the fishermen and their methods that cause some concern for fishery managers and researchers; they say that for those reasons, the sustainability of the marine ecosystems could be in danger of being ruined.  - Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river.  - Corral Bay is a bay in the mouth of the Valdivia River, southern Chile. Its main towns are Corral and Niebla. The mouth of the bay is between Juan Latorre point and Morro Gonzalo, with a width of 5.5 km. All the year the bay is transited by merchant, transport and fish boats. The bay is famous for being one of the most fortified bays in Spanish America in colonial time (see: Valdivian Fort System).  - Mariculture is a specialized branch of aquaculture involving the cultivation of marine organisms for food and other products in the open ocean, an enclosed section of the ocean, or in tanks, ponds or raceways which are filled with seawater. An example of the latter is the farming of marine fish, including finfish and shellfish like prawns, or oysters and seaweed in saltwater ponds. Non-food products produced by mariculture include: fish meal, nutrient agar, jewellery (e.g. cultured pearls), and cosmetics.  - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.  - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - Angling is a method of fishing by means of an \\"angle\\" (fish hook). The hook is usually attached to a fishing line and the line is often attached to a fishing rod. Fishing rods are usually fitted with a fishing reel that functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. The hook itself can be dressed with lures or bait. A bite indicator such as a float, and a weight or sinker are sometimes used.  - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.  - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.  - Centro de Estudios Científicos (English: \\"Center for Scientific Studies\\") also known by its acronym CECS is a private, non-profit corporation based in Valdivia, Chile, devoted to the development, promotion and diffusion of scientific research. CECs research areas include biophysics, molecular physiology, theoretical physics, glaciology and climate change. The centre was created in 1984 as Centro de Estudios Científicos de Santiago with 150,000 dollars a year for each year of three from the Tinker Foundation of New York City. In 2004-2005 glaciologists from CECS organized the Chilean South Pole Expedition in collaboration with the Chilean Navy and Instituto Antártico Chileno. CECS was founded in Santiago but is since 2000 housed in the recently modernized, German-style Hotel Schuster located by Valdivia River. Claudio Bunster, a physicist and winner of Chile's National Prize in Exact Sciences, is the Director of CECS.  - The Drake Passage or Mar de HocesSea of Hocesis the body of water between South America's Cape Horn and the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica. It connects the southwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean (Scotia Sea) with the southeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and extends into the Southern Ocean.  - The Valdivia River or Río Valdivia, as it is known locally, is a major river in southern Chile. It is the continuation of the Calle-Calle River, from the point where it meets the Cau-Cau River in the city of Valdivia. The Valdivia river ends in Corral Bay, on the Pacific coast. Other tributaries are the Cruces River, the Tornagaleones River and the Futa River. Pedro de Valdivia Bridge crosses the river in downtown Valdivia.  - An \\"aquatic animal\\" is an animal, either vertebrate or invertebrate, which lives in water for most or all of its life. It may breathe air or extract its oxygen from that dissolved in water through specialised organs called gills, or directly through its skin. Natural environments and the animals that live in them can be categorized as aquatic (water) or terrestrial (land).  - Whaling is the hunting of whales for meat, oil, blubber, and scientific research. Its earliest forms date to at least circa 3000 BC. Various coastal communities have long histories of subsistence whaling and harvesting beached whales. Industrial whaling emerged with organized fleets in the 17th century; competitive national whaling industries in the 18th and 19th centuries; and the introduction of factory ships along with the concept of whale harvesting in the first half of the 20th century. By the late 1930s, more than 50,000 whales were killed annually In 1986, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling in order to increase the whale stock.  - Pedro Gutiérrez de Valdivia or Valdiva (April 17, 1497  December 25, 1553) was a Spanish conquistador and the first royal governor of Chile. After serving with the Spanish army in Italy and Flanders, he was sent to South America in 1534, where he served as lieutenant under Francisco Pizarro in Peru, acting as his second in command. In 1540 he led an expedition of 150 Spaniards into Chile, where he defeated a large force of Indians and founded Santiago in 1541. He extended Spanish rule south to the Bío-Bío River in 1546, fought again in Peru (1546  48), and returned to Chile as governor in 1549. He began to conquer Chile south of the Bío-Bío and founded Concepción in 1550. He was captured and killed in a campaign against the Araucanian Indians. The city of Valdivia in Chile is named after him.  - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas.  - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.  - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\"  \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\"  \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.
