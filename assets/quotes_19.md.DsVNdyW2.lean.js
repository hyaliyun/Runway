The operation ends when a 'civilian' woman approaches the group and reveals multiple grenades under her garment, at this point the operation is revealed to be a training exercise for rookie troops on US soil. The sergeant lambastes the troops for their failure then tells them they are going on a mission to bring supplies to scientists working on a surveillance system in a top secret area. By this time many of the troops have their individual characters established, namely that Napoleon is actually anti-war and that Crank is particularly gung-ho and violent.On arriving at the secret base there is no sign of the scientists. A garbled radio message is received followed by a mirror signal from atop a hill. The sergeant orders a search and rescue mission leaving behind Napoleon as punishment for questioning this order and Amber to monitor the radio. As they are climbing, Mickey falls into an old mine shaft, twisting his ankle in the process but is pulled out by the sergeant who orders him to go back to base.

Premise: \\"American Movie suggests that there's no such thing as the little people in the hinterlands anymore.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"American Movie suggests there is still lots of things like little people in the hinterlands.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"American Movie suggests that there's no such thing as the little people in the hinterlands anymore,\\" the hypothesis \\"American Movie suggests there is still lots of things like little people in the hinterlands\\" appears to be contradictory and unlikely to be true. To further analyze this, let's delve deeper into the context, meaning, and implications of the premise and the hypothesis. The term \\"little people\\" refers to individuals who are not famous, powerful, or influential and typically lead ordinary lives within their local communities. \\"Hinterlands,\\" in this case, signifies remote or rural areas that are often thought to be detached from the modern, fast-paced urban lifestyle. These areas are generally associated with simplicity, traditional values, and a more personal sense of community. The premise suggests that American Movie, presumably a film or documentary, posits that the traditional concept of little people living in such hinterlands is fading or has already disappeared. This could mean that the film portrays their way of life as being gradually engulfed or assimilated by the globalized world, resulting in the erosion of their distinct identities and lifestyles. The factors contributing to this may include advances in technology, social media, pop culture, or economic development that have seeped into these once isolated areas. On the other hand, the hypothesis appears to challenge the premise, suggesting that American Movie portrays the existence and continued prevalence of little people in hinterlands. This implies that the film acknowledges the presence of individuals and communities that remain rooted in their traditional lifestyles and values, away from the mainstream urbanization and globalization. Given the opposing nature of the premise and the hypothesis, one cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true, unless the premise itself is false or misleading. However, without any evidence or information to challenge the validity of the premise, it would be reasonable to assume that the hypothesis is untrue based on the available information. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"American Movie suggests there is still lots of things like little people in the hinterlands\\" seems to be contradictory to the given premise and is unlikely to be true. To determine its validity, one would have to analyze the content and message of the film in question thoroughly, evaluate its portrayal of the subjects, and then gain a comprehensive understanding of the filmmaker's intent. Only then can the truthfulness of the hypothesis be accurately assessed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In the mean time, Maha Nawrahta opened the southern front on 23 October 1765  in three directions. He had 20,000 to 30,000 under his command.  A small army invaded by the Three Pagodas Pass towards Suphanburi. Another small army invaded down the Tenasserim coast towards Mergui  and Tenasserim  town. However, the main thrust of his attack was at Kanchanaburi. His 20,000-strong main southern army invaded via the Myitta Pass.  Kanchanaburi fell with little resistance. The main reason for the quick fall of Kanchanaburi could be that the Burmese were more battle-hardened. But it could also be that the Siamese command miscalculated where the Burmese main attack would come from, and had not sufficiently reinforced the fort to withstand a major attack. Judging by the Siamese chronicles' reporting of the main attack route, the Siamese command appeared to have believed that the main Burmese attack would come from the Gulf of Siam coastline, instead of the most obvious and shortest route via Kanchanaburi. The Siamese sources say that Maha Nawrahta's main invasion route came from southern Tenasserim, crossing the Tenasserim range at Chumphon and Phetburi. The path is totally different from the Kanchanaburi route reported by the Burmese chronicles. Historian Kyaw Thet specifically adds that the main attack route was via the Myitta Pass.

This question is a request for historical or chronological information. Hurricane Hugo is a specific event that took place in the past, and thus this question wants to determine its occurrence in the timeline of history. It indicates an inquiry on meteorological history, specifically within the context of significant storms or natural disasters. The question could be asking for several types of detailed information depending on the context. In its simplest form, it could be asking for the year that Hurricane Hugo happened. On a more detailed level, it might be requesting the precise dates that the hurricane started and ended. Additionally, it might be seeking information concerning the general period of the hurricane’s influence, such as the month or season within the year when it occurred. In a broader context, the question can also point toward a more complex understanding of the circumstances surrounding Hurricane Hugo. For example, if the query is raised in a conversation or a text regarding climate change, it can hint towards wanting to understand how weather patterns have shifted over time. This question might come from someone studying meteorology, history, or climate science. It can also intrigue individuals affected by the hurricane or those generally interested in significant historical events. For instance, first responders, community planners, and policy makers might wish to assess the timing of past hurricanes to prepare for future incidents. They might investigate not just when Hurricane Hugo happened, but when it hit particular locations, how long it lasted, and when recovery measures were implemented. In sum, the question \\"When was Hurricane Hugo?\\" is asking for a precise or general time frame of the occurrence of Hurricane Hugo.

Write a title for this article: Salaries of federal employees continue to lag behind those of similar private-sector jobs by 35 percent on average, an advisory committee has said in presenting what amounts to the latest data point in a long-running debate over how the two sectors compare. The 34.92 percent “pay gap” reported Friday essentially duplicates the 35.37 and 35.28 percent numbers reported the last two years by the Federal Salary Council and is close to those of other recent years. The council, consisting of federal employee union representatives and outside compensation experts, oversees the General Schedule pay system for the 1.5 million white-collar employees below senior levels. In the so-called GS system, rates vary by locality, with separate schedules for both Alaska and Hawaii, for designated metropolitan zones, and a catchall “rest of the U.S.” for elsewhere. [Federal Diary: Push to end federal pay disparities gains strength] Within the overall average, the largest indicated pay disparities are in the areas of Washington-Baltimore, at 51 percent, and the San Francisco and San Diego, at 49 percent. The smallest is in the catchall locality, 14 percent. Rates are paid according to where employees work, not where they live. Under a 1990 law, the numbers are supposed to be used to virtually close the measured differences with private-sector pay. However, no administration or Congress since then has supported providing the funds to do that. [We have no idea how federal pay compares to the private sector. So, let’s stop acting like we do, expert says] In practice, the federal raise is worked out in the annual budget process and a locality component, when one is paid, is divided according to the local gaps. The result is that pay for a GS job in the San Francisco locality, the highest paid, exceeds the pay for one of the same grade level in the catchall locality, the lowest paid, by 18 percent. Pay tables for the new year typically are set in late December by an executive order, which this year will include 13 new city zones, while 21 of the 31 existing ones will expand. That includes the already massive Washington-Baltimore zone, which will pull in three more counties in Maryland and one more each in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Those changes will trigger a special pay boost for more than 100,000 employees who will move from the catchall area into a city zone. [Libertarians take aim at ‘elite island ‘ of federal employment] “It’s a step in the right direction and it’s certainly an improvement for those employees, but it’s time for reasonable raises for all federal employees,” said J. David Cox, Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees and a council member. After a three-year freeze on salary rates — during which individuals still could receive raises for various reasons — federal employees received 1 percent raises in 2014 and 2015, and are in line for an average 1.3 percent increase in January. The pay gap figure is the official government word, based on the 1990 law, on how federal and non-federal salaries stack up. It is derived from Labor Department data on some 250 occupations by area, with various statistical adjustments. Federal employee organizations use the number in arguing that federal workers are underpaid, but other studies using different methods and different sets of data reach widely differing conclusions. For example, the libertarian Cato Institute recently published a report asserting that federal employees are overpaid by 78 percent on average. The conservative Heritage Foundation in 2010 found an advantage for federal workers of 22 percent. The Congressional Budget Office concluded in 2012 that salaries are roughly comparable overall, although with less educated federal employees at an advantage and more educated ones at a disadvantage. Later that year, the Government Accountability Office concluded that no one approach is definitive. For the projected 1.3 percent raise in January, 1 percentage point is to be paid across the board and the funds for the other 0.3 of a percentage point are to be divided up according to the indicated pay gaps by locality. The result will be raises slightly higher or lower than 1.3 percent. Congress could yet enact a different figure but all year it has followed a strategy of allowing that raise to take effect by default. Blue-collar employees fall under a separate locality pay system. However, for many years their raises have been set at the General Schedule amount paid in an area, not according to comparisons for blue-collar jobs. White-collar employees at senior levels are paid under separate systems that typically don’t pay raises automatically but rather link them to performance. Gender gap in federal salaries?

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Barbara  for the following movie plot:  The film opens with a dream sequence in which stock market tycoon Paul Marsh discovers a mermaid with razor sharp teeth while scuba diving into a carven pit. Paul awakes on a boat off the shores of Spain, where he is vacationing with his girlfriend, Barbara, and their friends Vicki and Howard. A sudden storm blows their boat against some hidden rocks. Vicki is trapped below deck, and Howard stays with her while Paul and Barbara take a lifeboat to the nearby fishing village of Imboca. During their absence, an unseen creature from the deep attacks the two in the boat. At shore, Barbara and Paul find no one about, and venture into town until they eventually reach the church, where they find a priest. Barbara convinces him to help them, and the priest speaks with two fishermen at the docks, who volunteer to take either Paul or Barbara to the wreck. Despite Paul's misgivings, Barbara stays to try to find a phone in order to call a doctor while Paul goes to help their friends. Vicki and Howard are mysteriously missing, however, and Paul is taken back to Imboca, where he is sent to the hotel that Barbara was supposed to have gone to. But she is missing as well, and Paul is left to wait for her in an old, filthy hotel room, where he dreams of the mermaid again. His fitful rest is disturbed by a large gathering of strange, fish-like people approaching the hotel and is forced to flee. He ends up in a macabre tannery full of human skins, where he discovers Howard's remains. He escapes the tannery by starting a fire, and finds momentary safety with an old drunkard named Ezequiel, the last human in Imboca. Ezequiel explains to Paul about how the village in lean times has fallen to the worship of Dagon. This brought incredible wealth to Imboca in the form of fish and gold, but also horror when Dagon demanded live sacrifices and human women (including Ezequiel's parents) to breed with. Paul begs Ezequiel to help him escape. Ezequiel relents and takes Paul to the Mayor's manor, so he can steal the town's only car. Ezequiel... The answer is:","output":"Who is Paul's girlfriend that accompanies him on the vacation to Spain and later ventures with him into the fishing village of Imboca?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: The first child in Britain known to have been screened as an embryo to ensure she did not carry a cancer gene was born Friday, a spokesman for University College London told CNN. Genetic screening allows lab-fertilized embryos to be tested for genes likely to lead to later health problems. Her embryo was screened in a lab days after conception to check for the BRCA-1 gene, linked to breast and ovarian cancer. People with the gene are known to have a 50-80 percent chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer in their lifetimes. British newspapers have dubbed the girl the \\"cancer-free\\" baby. \\"This little girl will not face the specter of developing this genetic form of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in her adult life,\\" said Paul Serhal, a consultant at University College London Hospital and Medical Director of the Assisted Conception Unit. \\"The parents will have been spared the risk of inflicting this disease on their daughter. The lasting legacy is the eradication of the transmission of this form of cancer that has blighted these families for generations.\\" Yet not everyone is thrilled with the idea of testing embryos for genes that could cause health problems later in life, a process known as preimplanatation genetic diagnosis. \\"This is not a cure for breast cancer,\\" said Josephine Quintavalle, co-founder of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, which describes itself as group that focuses on ethical dilemmas related to reproduction. What do you think about testing embryos for gene defects? \\"This is simply a mechanism for eliminating the birth of anybody (prone to) the disease,\\" she said. \\"It is basically a search-and-kill mechanism.\\" She opposes the procedure because embryos found to carry disease-causing genes often are discarded. She says that is essentially murder. \\"They will be destroyed,\\" she said. \\"They will never be allowed to live.\\" Doctors in Britain and elsewhere increasingly test embryos for genes that are certain to cause illnesses such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's Disease. What's different about the girl born Friday is that she is the first infant known to have been tested in Britain as an embryo for a gene that is merely likely -- not certain -- to cause disease. In the United States, geneticists are free to test for any condition for which they can develop a probe -- and they're free to look for genes that are certain to cause diseases as well as genes that merely may pose problems later in life. Quintavalle opposes any form of in-vitro fertilization where embryos are \\"killed,\\" she said. But she is particularly troubled by the idea of screening an embryo for the BRCA-1 gene because carriers of the gene do not always develop the disease, and the disease is not always fatal. \\"The message we are sending is: 'Better off dead than carrying (a gene linked to) breast cancer,'\\" she said. \\"We have gone very much down the proverbial slippery slope.\\" Peter Braude, one of the top British experts on the genetic testing of embryos, said he understands the ethical objections but focuses on the benefits. \\"There has always been a vociferous group in opposition,\\" he said. But \\"there are people who can benefit and I think they should be allowed to do so.\\" In fact, he argues that the procedure actually prevents abortions because it takes place on a three-day old embryo in a lab. Only embryos that lack the defective gene are implanted. \\"I don't think you can equate eight cells in a dish to an embryo or a child,\\" said Braude, head of the department of women's health at the King's College London School of Medicine. For many couples, the alternative to testing an embryo is to conceive a child naturally and test the fetus weeks or months into a pregnancy. Some couples opt for an abortion when such testing reveals a defect. Diagnosing an embryo genetically typically involves fertilizing an egg with a sperm in a lab, testing the resulting embryo and implanting it in the mother if no defects are found. Braude agrees that testing for diseases that may not be fatal -- or may not manifest themselves for decades -- raises thorny ethical questions. \\"How serious does it have to be before you throw away an embryo?\\" he asked. \\"Are you prepared to throw away a 16-week embryo for Huntington's, which will not manifest until age 40?\\" In Britain, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority determines the conditions for which geneticists can test. It has approved testing for more than 60 conditions since it was established in 1990. The authority approved testing for the BRCA-1 gene in 2008. Dr. Mark Hughes, who founded a genetics clinic in the United States, said he likes the idea of an authority that regulates what tests can be performed -- the system in place in Britain -- but believes that parents who want to test for genetic abnormalities should be allowed to do so. At his Genesis Genetics Institute in Detroit, Michigan, Hughes carries out about two tests a month for BRCA-1 or BRCA-2, a related gene. \\"The couple is the best one to be making these decisions, because they live with these diseases,\\" he said. \\"When it hits your family over and over again, many couples are saying: 'Enough of this. Let's prune this out of our family tree forever.'\\" He rejects the notion that parents will use genetic testing to remove all imperfections from children. \\"You can get up on your high horse and say people are looking for perfect children, but let's give these families more credit,\\" he said. \\"They just want one that has a fighting chance of not having a disease.\\" Hughes said he doubts genetic screening will ever be used to test all babies. That's partly because it costs the equivalent of about 11,755 -- 8,000 British pounds -- to screen embryos. It's also because the process is very complex. \\"It's gotten easier to do now than it was 19 years ago,\\" when Hughes did his first test for cystic fibrosis, he said. \\"But it has not exploded, not burst onto the medical field like some technologies do. \\"No one would use these technologies for a trivial reason. It's too much effort,\\" he said. \\"Not just the money -- it's so many hoops to jump through for a couple that would prefer to make their baby on vacation rather than in a clinic.\\"","output":"A baby girl was born in Britain after her embryo was screened to make sure she did not have a cancer gene. This special test, called genetic screening, helps doctors check if the tiny baby-to-be might have health problems later in life. In this case, they checked for a gene called BRCA-1, which can cause breast and ovarian cancer. People with this gene have a higher chance of getting these cancers. Some people are happy that the baby girl will not have to worry about these cancers in her life, but others believe that this kind of testing might lead to bad choices. One concern is that embryos that have these genes could be thrown away, which some people think is not right. While genetic testing can be helpful for some serious diseases, it also brings up questions about where we should draw the line and how far we should go in trying to avoid health issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom.

Objective: How do I know if I am successfully removing the air bubbles from concrete while pouring when making a countertop? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"To successfully remove air bubbles from concrete while pouring when making a countertop, it's essential to understand the importance of minimizing air bubbles and voids. Air bubbles and voids can compromise the strength, integrity, and aesthetics of the finished countertop. Applying suitable techniques and tools during the pouring process helps achieve a more uniform and strong concrete structure. Below are two solutions, with detailed explanations, that can assist in eliminating air bubbles from concrete when making a countertop. Solution 1: Concrete Vibrators and Proper Pouring Techniques This solution involves using a concrete vibrator to agitate the mixture, releasing trapped air bubbles and facilitating the settlement of the concrete. Concrete vibrators come in different types, such as pencil vibrators, form vibrators, and table vibrators. Ensure that the concrete vibrator is suitable for a countertop application and can effectively remove air bubbles. Follow these steps: 1. Prepare the concrete mix, ensuring it has the right blend of cement, sand, aggregate (if applicable), and water. The mix should be fluid enough to facilitate easy pouring and distribution, without being too thin or watery. 2. Pour the concrete mix into the countertop formwork, starting at one end and filling the form gradually. Avoid sudden drops and try to maintain a consistent flow level while pouring. 3. Insert the concrete vibrator into the freshly poured concrete mix to release trapped air bubbles. The vibrator should be evenly and systematically moved throughout the poured concrete, both vertically and horizontally, while ensuring that all areas are adequately covered. 4. While vibrating, monitor the surface of the concrete for air bubbles. As the vibrator agitates the mixture, you should notice reduced air bubbles coming to the surface. Additionally, the concrete should settle smoothly and consistently across the formwork, filling any gaps or voids. 5. Gradually remove the vibrator, avoiding any sudden movements that could trap air inside again. Evenly smooth the surface of the concrete using a trowel or screed. Solution 2: Manual Tapping and Agitation This solution is more labor-intensive but can be an adequate substitute if a concrete vibrator is not available. The key is to agitate the poured concrete mix manually to help release trapped air and ensure proper settlement. Follow these steps: 1. As with Solution 1, start by preparing the appropriate concrete mix to ensure proper consistency for pouring. 2. Pour the concrete mix steadily into the countertop formwork, avoiding sudden drops or disruptions in the pouring flow. 3. Use a wooden or metal rod to agitate the freshly poured concrete mix. Insert the rod into the concrete and make small circular or side-to-side motions, ensuring all areas are covered. 4. Once a sufficient amount of air bubbles have surfaced, smooth out the concrete by tapping the sides of the formwork using a rubber mallet or a hammer covered with a soft cloth. Tapping the formwork helps release trapped air bubbles and settles the concrete more uniformly. 5. Visually inspect the surface of the poured concrete. If you notice a significant reduction in visible air bubbles and a smooth, consistent settling of the mixture, you have successfully removed most of the air bubbles. 6. Utilize a screed or trowel to smooth and level the concrete surface, preparing it for finishing. In terms of naive physics reasoning, Solution 1 involving the use of concrete vibrators and proper pouring techniques can be considered a more sound solution. Utilizing a concrete vibrator provides more consistent and effective results in removing air bubbles from the freshly poured concrete mix. Additionally, it requires less manual labor and delivers a smoother concrete surface, which is vital for achieving an aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound countertop. However, Solution 2 offers a viable alternative for those who may not have access to a concrete vibrator or prefer a hands-on approach. Ultimately, it's crucial to employ the necessary techniques and tools to maximize air bubble removal and guarantee a strong, long-lasting, and visually appealing concrete countertop."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This incredible X-Ray shows how a farmer was millimetres from death when an 18-inch metal prong speared his torso but miraculously missed all his vital organs after snagging on his key fob. Graham Heatley, 52, was speared through the right buttock by the bailing fork which came out the lower left side of his stomach after he forgot to apply the handbrake on his 1.5 tonne tractor and it rolled back downhill towards him. Emergency services rushed to Mr Heatley's 160 acre farm in Lyneal, Shropshire, after neighbours heard his cries for help. An X-Ray shows the spike pierced through Graham Heatley's body but was stopped from going further by his key chain. The accident happened after Mr Heatley forgot to apply the handbrake on his 1.5 tonne tractor (pictured) and it rolled back downhill towards him. Mr Heatley was flown to hospital by air ambulance in a serious condition with the spike still sticking out of his body. He then underwent a four-hour operation at University Hospital of North Staffordshire where doctors found the prong had missed his vital organs by just 1.5cm. Incredibly, he was out of hospital within six days of the fork being removed. Mr Heatley, who runs the 160 acre farm with his mum Mary, 78, said he knew he was in trouble when he felt a 'sharp twinge' in his backside. He went on: 'I had picked up some up some hay and had placed it on the floor to cut the wrap and I don’t think I applied the hand-brake properly on the tractor because I felt this fork going into me. 'As I was bending over I felt this sharp twinge and I knew that’s when I was in trouble. 'I turned to work out what was happening I saw it was rolling towards me and the tine went into my right buttock. 'It ended up going through and poked out of my abdomen on the left.

'To get me free they had to unbolt the tine (prong) from the tractor and they then got me on a stretcher and put me in the air ambulance with it still in me. 'They then flew me hospital which only took 12 minutes. At first they struggled to close the helicopter’s door with the tine sticking out. I was awake the whole time. 'I was taken to A&E and transferred to theatre and at that point I don’t really remember much more.

Mr Heatley was flown to hospital by air ambulance in a serious condition with the spike still sticking out of his body. Emergency services rushed to Mr Heatley's 160 acre farm in Lyneal, Shropshire, after neighbours heard his cries for help. The accident happened after Mr Heatley left the handbrake of his tractor off and it rolled back towards him. 'I just say thank God for my keys. They probably saved my life.' Surgeon Neil Yeomans, who performed the four-hour operation, said it was one of the most unusual injuries he has ever had to deal with. He said: 'We put him through the scanner to see what exactly we were dealing with. 'We then had to put him on the operating table in the theatre at 45 degrees because of how the spike was sticking through him. 'To keep him at that angle we had to use sandbags to prop him up and support him, which is highly unusual. 'We then had to ease his clothes off around the spike as he was fully clothed. 'I then had to operate on him on his side, which can be quite difficult when you are not used to doing it. 'In total three of us were doing the surgery and we just had to pull the spike in a controlled direction. 'The spike had entered the pelvis and was only 1.5cm from his urethra and it was only an inch from the vessel in front of the rectum and behind the bladder. So it missed the rectal tube. 'If the spike hadn’t missed any of those then it would have been life threatening and he could have been left having to use a colostomy bag. 'Mr Heatley was extremely lucky and he has recovered amazingly well.' Graham Heatley, 52, avoided serious injury when the spike hit his key fob. Surgeon Neil Yeomans, who performed the four-hour operation to remove the spike, said it was one of the most unusual injuries he has ever had to deal with.","output":"1.

Although \\"zaibatsu\\" themselves existed from the 19th century, the term was not in common use until after World War I. By definition, the \\"zaibatsu\\" were large family-controlled vertical monopolies consisting of a holding company on top, with a wholly owned banking subsidiary providing finance, and several industrial subsidiaries dominating specific sectors of a market, either solely, or through a number of subsubsidiary companies.  - South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a sovereign state in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula.  - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\").

The receivership remedy is an equitable remedy that emerged in the English Chancery courts, where receivers were appointed to protect real property. Receiverships are also a remedy of last resort in litigation involving the conduct of executive agencies that fail to comply with constitutional or statutory obligations to populations that rely on those agencies for their basic human rights.   - A chaebol (, ; from \\"chae\\" \\"wealth or property\\" + \\"bol\\" \\"faction or clan\\"  also written with the same Chinese characters  as Zaibatsu) is a South Korean form of business conglomerate. They are typically global multinationals and own numerous international enterprises, controlled by a chairman with power over all the operations. The term is often used in a context similar to that of the English word \\"conglomerate\\". The term was first used in 1984. There are several dozen large Korean family-controlled corporate groups which fall under this definition.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"El Niño can indirectly impact a step of the process of hurricane formation. Specifically, it can influence the environmental conditions that favor or inhibit the development of tropical cyclones, which in turn can result in changes in wind speeds.  El Niño is a climate phenomenon characterized by an irregularly occurring warming of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, which can cause changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. This leads to anomalies in wind patterns and sea surface temperatures across the tropical regions, affecting weather patterns worldwide. When it comes to hurricanes, El Niño tends to increase wind shear in the Atlantic basin, which inhibits hurricane formation and intensification. On the other hand, it tends to decrease wind shear and create more favorable conditions for hurricane development in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. So in the context of hurricane formation, El Niño can indirectly impact a step of the process by altering the atmospheric conditions that allow for tropical cyclones to develop and intensify. While El Nino doesn't directly impact a specific step in the process outlined above, its influence on the overall conditions in the atmosphere can affect the likelihood and intensity of hurricanes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which organization does Sir John Hamilton's servant betray? ?  County Cork, Ireland, 1920. Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command. News arrives that the three remaining IRA prisoners have been tortured and shot. Simultaneously, the brigade receives orders to \\"execute the spies\\".

I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court. Answer:","output":"The full names of the two people who died in prison are Li Zhi and He Xinyin. They were both jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas,\\" including questioning the social hierarchy and promoting the education of women."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","output":"We are given the equation: 214*z + 305*z - 852 - 1776 - 2562 = 0.  To solve for z, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms. The like terms are the terms with the variable z, which are 214*z and 305*z, and the constant terms, which are -852, -1776, and -2562. 214*z + 305*z = 519*z (adding the coefficients of z terms) -852 - 1776 - 2562 = -5190 (adding the constants) So, our simplified equation is: 519*z - 5190 = 0 Step 2: Solve for z. We want to isolate z on one side of the equation. To do that, we need to move the constant term to the other side. 519*z = 5190 Now, to isolate z, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of z, which is 519. z = 5190 / 519 Step 3: Simplify the fraction to get the value of z. 5190 and 519 share a common factor of 519. z = (5190 / 519) = (519 * 10) / 519 When we divide 5190 by 519, we get 10. z = 10 The solution to the equation is z = 10."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt.  - An arch is a curved structure that spans a space and may or may not support weight above it. Arch may be synonymous with vault, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the Ancient Romans who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures.  - The flying buttress (arc-boutant, arch buttress) is a specific form of buttress composed of an arched structure that extends from the upper portion of a wall to a pier of great mass, in order to convey to the ground the lateral forces that push a wall outwards, which are forces that arise from vaulted ceilings of stone and from wind-loading on roofs.  - Kaliningrad Oblast (\\"Kaliningradskaya oblast\\") is a federal subject of the Russian Federation that is located on the coast of the Baltic Sea. As an oblast, its constitutional status is equal to each of the other 84 federal subjects. Its administrative center is the city of Kaliningrad, formerly known as Königsberg. It is the only Baltic port in the Russian Federation that remains ice-free in winter. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 941,873.  - Gothic architecture is a style of architecture that flourished in Europe during the high and late medieval period.

Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as \\"\\" (\\"French work\\") with the term \\"Gothic\\" first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault (which evolved from the joint vaulting of romanesque architecture) and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls, guild halls, universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings, such as dorms and rooms.  - The Church of the Visitation of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary ( Polish : Koció Nawiedzenia Najwitszej Marii Panny ) , otherwise known as St. Mary 's Church ( Koció Mariacki ) is a church in Warsaw , Poland . It is one of oldest buildings and one of the few surviving examples of Gothic architecture in the city . It is located at ulica Przyrynek 2 .  - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north.

Article: These days, when the world seems to be hard to control, walking can make you feel peaceful. It gives you a chance to slow down, to relax and to appreciate yourself and your life in general. It helps you slow down enough to breathe deeply, to calm your thoughts, and to research the natural world filled with wonders. And yes, to love yourself more. Try to spend one day for a long travel on foot--far from the requirements of work and family. First, choose a date and mark it as your \\"relaxing day\\". Next, choose a place that you want to visit on foot. If you enjoy being out in nature, head to a wide and open place. Try to choose a place that's no more than 15 minutes from your home. You want to spend your time walking, not driving. Walk at an easy speed so you can walk longer and farther. If you normally walk two miles a day, go for four to six miles. Wear comfortable clothes. If it's warm, wear a hat to protect your face. And don't forget your sunglasses-- not only to protect your eyes but also to give you a sense of privacy while you walk. Before you go out, get up early so you can spend a few minutes relaxing. Relaxing is something few people spend in their spare time, but it leaves you feeling much lighter and less annoyed. Read something relaxing before you leave home, and it'll put you in a different condition of mind. And, of course, eat a healthy breakfast and drink plenty of water. Then pick up your backpack and head out. And enjoy yourself. Question: From the passage, we can know  _  . Options: A: the world is very peaceful now B: we can have a walk to relax ourselves during busy days C: when we want to have a long walk, we should let others drive a car D: we should have a long hike every day","output":"B: we can have a walk to relax ourselves during busy days"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: I read this background article the other day: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.  I am facing a new situation today: Jeff and Jeremy were neighbors and best friends since kindergarten. They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Answer:","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, it can be inferred that Jeff, who experienced a significant growth spurt during puberty, would have certain advantages in playing basketball compared to soccer, due to his increased height. In basketball, height plays a crucial role in various aspects of the game, such as rebounding, shot blocking, and having an easier time shooting over shorter defenders. A taller player like Jeff would be more likely to excel in these areas, giving him an edge in the game. On the other hand, while height can be an advantage in soccer, especially for goalkeepers or players competing for headers, soccer places a greater emphasis on skills such as dribbling, passing, and shooting, which do not necessarily correlate with height. Therefore, the advantages Jeff gains from his height might not be as significant in soccer as they would be in basketball. However, it is important to note that physical traits such as height are not the sole determinants of success in any sport. Factors such as athleticism, skill level, mental toughness, and dedication also play significant roles in determining a player's ability to excel in a particular sport. Therefore, while Jeff might have an advantage in basketball due to his height, his overall success in either sport would still be dependent on a variety of other factors. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the background article, Jeff would likely be better suited to play basketball due to his increased height, as height plays a more significant role in the game of basketball compared to soccer. However, it is essential to consider other factors such as skills, athleticism, and dedication when evaluating a person's potential success in any sport."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What had \\"killed and severely injured lake bathers recently?\\" from the following article ?  Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that \\"there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks,\\" and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that \\"some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species.

Llano and Richard Ellis suggest that a bull shark could have been responsible for the fatal Jersey Shore attacks. Bull sharks swim from the ocean into freshwater rivers and streams and have attacked people around the world. In his book Sharks: Attacks on Man (1975), Llano writes, One of the most surprising aspects of the Matawan Creek attacks was the distance from the open sea. Elsewhere in the book are accounts of well-documented shark-human interactions at Ahwaz, Iran, which is 90 miles (140 km) upriver from the sea.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. How do people define their identity? How can I define my self-identity? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"To address the first question, how people define their identity, let me break it down step by step: 1. Personal experiences: People often look at their past and present experiences, including family, education, career, and relationships, to define who they are. These experiences shape their values, beliefs, and preferences. 2. Interests and hobbies: People's passions, hobbies, and activities that they enjoy in their free time also contribute to their identities. These interests help to distinguish them from others and give them a sense of purpose or belonging. 3. Values and beliefs: A person's values and beliefs form a significant part of their identity. People often define themselves by their opinions on various subjects, like politics, religion, and morality. 4. Group affiliations: People often find identity within the groups they associate with, such as family, cultural groups, or social circles. These connections allow them to feel a sense of belonging. 5. Personality traits: A person's natural tendencies, like being introverted or extroverted, organized, or spontaneous, contribute to their overall identity as well. Regarding the second question, how to define one's self-identity, here are some steps: 1. Self-reflection: Engage in introspection to explore your personal experiences, beliefs, values, and interests. 2. Identify your strengths and weaknesses: Recognize and list your unique qualities, strengths, and areas where you may need improvement. Acknowledging these aspects helps you understand your individuality. 3. Consider your personal values and beliefs: Reflect on your core beliefs and values, such as religious beliefs, moral principles, and political affiliations. These beliefs and values shape your decision-making and actions, which contribute to your self-identity. 4. Acknowledge your interests and hobbies: Pinpoint the activities and hobbies that you enjoy most and provide you with a sense of individuality and accomplishment. 5. Recognize your social connections and group affiliations: Evaluate your relationships with friends, family, and cultural or social groups that are important to you and influence your sense of belonging. Now, to determine if these two questions are the same: Upon analysis, these two questions are related but distinct. The first question asks how people, in general, define their identity. My response addresses the various components that people consider when defining their identities. The second question is more personalized, specifically asking how you can define your own self-identity. The response I provided for this question outlines a process for discovering and understanding one's identity. In summary, while these two questions are intertwined in subject matter, they address different aspects of the topic: one being more focused on understanding the concept of identity, and the other on defining and discovering personal identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Driving home from work one evening in the heavy rain, I found a very wet, injured cat on the side of the road. He looked up at me, meowing pitifully. A car must have hit it so it wasn't able to move. I stopped my car and carried the cat in and went on driving. At the nearest vet clinic, the vet gently examined it. \\"He's about eight months old and has two broken legs, but I would need X-rays to know how serious the damage is,\\" he told me. \\"As he's not your cat, I don't know if you want to go ahead with this. It could be rather expensive.\\" I knew it would cost me hundreds of dollars, but I agreed with his advice. The following morning the vet rang to say the X-rays confirmed two bad breaks in his legs. \\"I'll operate on his legs and put metal pins in them to keep them fixed.\\" he told me. That afternoon I went to pick up my little friend. There I could hardly recognize him. His previously dirty fur was now a beautiful silver grey. His front legs were in two casts and he lay there looking at me, purring  happily. I thanked the doctor and went out to pay the bill. \\"I think you've given me the wrong account,\\" I said to the clerk. \\"This is only 85. He's had X-rays and an operation on his legs.\\" \\"No, that's right,\\" she replied. \\"The vet has only charged you for the medication.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: \\"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of \\"relentless cacophony\\". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \\"harmless\\". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: \\"The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.\\" In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, \\"as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water\\".Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward.

Article: SAN FRANCISCO --California regulators late Thursday adopted the first large-scale cap-and-trade program in the U.S., in a move officials say will protect the environment without hurting the state's still-struggling economy.      In a 9-1 vote, the state Air Resources Board voted to adopt rules, scheduled to start in 2012, that place a limit on greenhouse-gas emissions for the state that will decline over time.      Power plants, refineries and other industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide and can't cut their emissions by the required amount will be able to obtain pollution allowances from the state or buy them from other emitters with excess allowances.      Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the cap-and-trade rules will help fight climate change and also boost California's clean-technology industry and overall economy.      \\"Billions of dollars are being poured into California in clean technology venture capital investment,\\" Mr. Schwarzenegger said. \\"Of course, we have to be sensitive because it's an economic downturn, and this Air Resources Board knows they have to be sensitive. But we have to reach our goals by 2020.\\"      Companies with facilities that emit carbon dioxide could also purchase carbon credits, or offsets, tied to emission-reduction projects, such as forests that are managed to contain carbon dioxide, to comply with required emission cuts.      Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said there was still work to be done, including ensuring safeguards against manipulation of the market-based program and establishing a \\"community benefits fund\\" that would use some auction funds to help low-income families manage potential increases in energy prices.      She added that the board was mindful of proceeding with the rules without overburdening consumers, businesses or the economy. \\"We are being cautious and careful within the context of a very bold effort,\\" Mrs. Nichols said.      The new rules come less than a week after the world's nations reached agreement on a package of climate initiatives last week at a United Nations-sponsored summit in Cancun, Mexico. And they come six weeks after a referendum in which Californians voted to keep the state's climate law intact. A federal proposal to limit U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, however, has stalled in Congress amid political bickering.      Recent scientific studies have found that many of the earth's largest lakes have been warming more quickly than the air around them in the last 25 years, and that many glaciers around the world have been melting at an increasingly rapid pace, particularly in southern South America and Alaska.      California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition to the proposed cap-and-trade program, the state has established an aggressive renewable-energy mandate and a requirement that the carbon content of the state's vehicle fuels be cut by 10% by 2020, as part of efforts to achieve the emissions-reduction goal.      Under the proposed cap-and-trade rules, the state would give away most allowances in the first few years of the cap-and-trade program, then sell many allowances in auctions in later years. Industries that could prove the regulations were putting them at a significant competitive advantage to companies in other states could be eligible for additional free allowances. The proposed rules would establish a floor on the price of allowances sold at auction of 10 per metric ton of carbon dioxide.      Environmental groups argued for greater auctioning of pollution allowances, while heavy industry groups pressed for more allowance giveaways.      \\"We don't need an auction,\\" said Dorothy Rothrock, a spokeswoman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. \\"We think it's an extra burden on industries attempting to comply with this regulation.\\"      But the Sierra Club said the provision would benefit companies that were unlikely to leave the state.      Other environmental groups lauded the cap-and-trade program.      \\"It's a step forward that will make our country more competitive and make California a leader in the clean technology industry,\\" said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York.      Greenhouse-gas emitters could purchase carbon offsets--which are expected to trade at a discount to emission allowances--to comply with 8% of their annual emission obligations.      Carbon market participants said carbon offset prices have jumped in anticipation of California's adoption of the cap-and-trade rules.      Lenny Hochschild, a carbon broker with Evolution Markets, said offset prices have doubled from about 4 a ton of carbon dioxide to 8 a ton amid much higher volumes of trade in recent weeks.      Environmental groups and residents of California's forest regions have asked the ARB to exclude companies that clear-cut forests from participating in the offset program.      The ARB has said it will consider allowing carbon credits from a range of other types of projects, from forest protection projects in Mexico and other countries, to projects aimed at destroying ozone-depleting substances.      Some carbon market participants say the agency should act quickly to approve more types of projects to avoid a lack of supply of such credits to meet demand.      Write to Cassandra Sweet at cassandra.sweet@dowjones.com ||||| California regulators Thursday voted to cap the greenhouse gas emissions of the state's major industries and establish the nation's first broad-based carbon trading program.The move marks another bellwether moment for a state that has led in environmental policy, coming as national climate legislation to regulate greenhouse gases and curb climate change has stalled in Congress.\\"This is an historic venture,\\" said Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, as the panel voted 9 to 1 to approve some 3,000 pages of regulations and supporting documents, crafted over three years of intense negotiations with businesses and public interest groups.Given the state's fragile economy, Nichols said, \\"most political people said we should do as little as possible as slowly as possible.\\" Instead, she said, \\"we are being cautious and careful, but in the context of a very bold effort.\\" Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a champion of a market-based approach to climate regulation, showed up partway through a 10-hour public hearing at the board's headquarters to applaud the agency's effort to develop trading rules for carbon emissions. \\"We have led the nation in developing green policies,\\" he said. \\"And we have seen our green economy grow as a result.\\"California's 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act requires the state to slash greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 — amounting to a 15% cut below today's levels.The complex cap-and-trade system is a centerpiece of the state's multifaceted plan. Already approved are rules to hike the fuel efficiency of automobiles, cut the energy intensity of gasoline and source a third of the state's electricity from renewable sources.More than 180 industry executives, environmentalists and concerned citizens testified on the trading regulations, which will limit emissions from 600 major industrial plants in the state. Representatives of the cement, electrical and agribusiness sectors picked apart aspects of the rules, as did forest conservationists, health advocates and anti-poverty lawyers.In the day's most contentious debate, more than a score of environmentalists and residents of Sierra Nevada communities showed up to protest provisions that would allow industrial plants to reduce their obligation to curb pollution at their own facilities by allowing them to purchase offsets from timber companies that pledge to tailor their practices to preserve more carbon in forests.Several board members sought to exclude a part of the regulation that allows parcels to be clear-cut and replanted. They were voted down, 7 to 3.The forest rules divided the environmental community, with such groups as the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund — both strong backers of carbon trading — siding with Sierra Pacific, the state's largest timber company, in support of the rule as written. Local activists from Sierra Nevada communities, backed by the Sierra Club, pleaded with the board to exclude any trading that could encourage clear-cutting and the replacement of natural forests with single-species plantations.\\"We want California to be the leader on climate, not a laughingstock,\\" said Addie Jacobson, a board member of the Sierra Nevada Alliance who said she spoke for 85 organizations.Only one air board member voted against the overall cap-and-trade program: John Telles, a physician who represents the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. Telles said the measure would not protect low-income residents from energy price hikes. He also suggested that a carbon trading market would be open to \\"manipulation,\\" as was the case with California's disastrous deregulation of electricity markets in the 1990s.Under the plan, the state would cap each industrial plant's emissions in 2012, gradually lowering the cap over the next eight years. Firms would be granted allowances for each ton of carbon dioxide they could emit.Many speakers at the public hearing criticized the board's decision to ignore its own economic advisory committee's recommendation to auction those allowances from the start of the program, rather than give them to industry and phase in auctions.\\"Auctioning provides a sharper price signal,\\" said UC Berkeley economist Michael Hanneman, adding that giving away allowances for free \\"risks granting windfall profits\\" to industry. |||||Summary:","output":"California has a new rule to help protect the environment. They made a cap-and-trade program. It's the first big one in the U.S. Cap-and-trade is a way to limit pollution. It gives companies a limit on how much pollution they can make. If a company can't cut their pollution enough, they can buy allowances. This lets them keep polluting but only for a little while. The idea is to make pollution go down little by little over time. This plan aims to fight climate change. It also hopes to make California a leader in clean technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These are the two most common oils used by movie theaters. Heat a thin layer of oil until shimmering in a large pot. Add a few test kernels, then add the rest of the popcorn when they pop. Remove from heat for thirty seconds so the kernels reach an even temperature. Return to heat then cook, shaking occasionally, until popped. You'll need about ⅓ cup popcorn kernels for a 6 quart (5.6 L) pot. Many theaters add a salt product that contains artificial butter flavor, often sold under the brand name Flavacol. You can order this online to add to your own popcorn. Since 1 tsp (5 mL) Flavacol contains 116% of the FDA-recommended daily sodium limit, it's best to sprinkle sparingly. Theater employees typically toss in the Flavacol before popping. However, Flavacol does release airborne chemicals when heated which could cause harm over long term use. This is unlikely to happen if you only make popcorn for personal use, but you can add the Flavacol after cooking if you are concerned. The Flavacol should already add that artificial butter flavor, but if you want that greasy feel on your tongue and fingers, you can buy a jug of \\"popcorn topping\\" online. Drizzle this on top to taste after your popcorn is ready. As you might imagine, this is mostly hydrogenated fat, and not the best for your health.

A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy  in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused  by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel  and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way.     The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. \\"They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,\\" she said.\\" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners.\\" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. \\"The question,\\" said Ms Darker Smith, \\"is why she did not break the door down herself.\\" Answer:","output":"What is the key finding in Susan Darker Smith's study on the effect of fairy tales on women who experienced abuse?

Read this: The most important existing communal shelters were the London Underground stations. Although many civilians had used them as such during the First World War, the government in 1939 refused to allow the stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel, and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids; but by the second week of heavy bombing the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened.

This created a stark contrast between the lush, emerald green hill filled with thriving cultivation and the barren, sun-scorched plain. People tried various methods to irrigate the plain, but nothing seemed to do the trick. Consequently, the denizens of the plain lived in shrinking despair while the hill-dwellers prospered. One day, a traveling sage arrived at the plain-dwelling settlement. He possessed a peculiar air of wisdom and an unusually gentle demeanor, which impressed the plain dwellers. The chief of the settlement had heard of sages and their abilities, so he approached the sage to seek guidance on their predicament. Step-by-step thoughts: Continuing a story requires several factors to be taken into consideration: the setting, the established situation, and the characters. To keep the story engaging, the introduction of the traveling sage presents a new possibility for change. The sage's entrance also creates a point of tension as the narrative now hinges on the sage's response to the problem, potentially adding depth to the story.

However beneficent  his  reputation  the sordid past of such men and institutions keeps coming back to afflict  his  papacy like a recurrent  debilitating disease. Things arenât much better for the pope in Chile  where  Francis  will begin  his  official apostolic visit when  he  arrives Monday evening.  Francis  recently appointed controversial Bishop Juan Barros to head the diocese of the city of Osorno in the south of the country  even though Barros worked directly under Fernando Karadima  a priest convicted of sexual abuse by the Vatican and sentenced to the usual âlife of prayer and penitenceâ in a secluded monastery. Barros denies knowing of Karadimaâs crimes  even though he is named by several witnesses as ultimately aiding in the cover-up  and sent a letter to the Vatican in support of the known predator during the Vaticanâs investigation. According to documents seen by the Associated Press   Francis  considered sending Barros on a sabbatical to avoid any potential dust-up among abuse survivors but  as the AP reports  it was a decision â he  didn't ultimately take.â Last Friday  four Catholic churches in Santiago were firebombed ahead of the popeâs visit.

Peter Saunders  a victim of clerical sex abuse and member of the commission who had been on leave for the better part of the year  officially resigned from the commission in December  citing âdisappointment that that commission had not done moreâ as  his  primary reason.  He  has been invited by protesters in Chile to join the demonstrations to stand in solidarity with victims in protests against the pontiff.  The pope  will begin  his  apostolic visit late Monday evening in Chile before moving on to Peru later in the week.  He  will return to Rome Jan. 21.","output":"The task asks you to determine the sentiment of the given document towards the entity Pope Francis.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. If you are experiencing vertigo and have recently been diagnosed with BPPV, you should to go to a doctor who will perform the Epley maneuver to reposition your inner ear crystals. A doctor or therapist is the only person who should do this maneuver if this is your first time experiencing BPPV. However, they will teach you how to perform it on yourself, just in case your symptoms return in the future. While you can do the maneuver at home (covered in Method Two of this article), going through the process with a doctor first will help you understand what it feels like to have the procedure done correctly. Trying at home without any context can actual further displace your ear crystals and make your vertigo worse! If you already know what this procedure feels like when done correctly, you can move to method two to refresh your memory on how to perform it. The doctor will seat you on the edge of a table or bed, with your head facing forward. Your doctor will then place one hand on each side of your head and will quickly move your head 45 degrees to the right. She will then immediately lie you down on the table so that your head is still in the 45 degree angle to the right. Your doctor will ask you to remain in this position for 30 seconds. Your head will be lying off the examination table or, if you have a pillow behind your back, your head will be on the table. Whatever level your head is resting at, the goal is to have your head lower than the rest of your body when you lie down. While you remain in the position she has just placed you in, she will reposition herself and then quickly rotate your head 90 degrees to the opposite side (which means that she will turn your head so that it is facing to the left). You should pay attention to any feelings of vertigo that you have. These will most likely stop after 30 seconds in this new position. Next the doctor will ask you to roll onto your left side, while she rapidly rotates your head to the right (your nose will now be angled at the floor). To visualize what you will be doing, imagine that you are lying on your right side on your bed, but your face is pointing down into your pillow. You will hold this position for 30 seconds. Double check the rotation side and nose direction. Note that if your doctor determines the problem is on the right, they will rotate your body and head to the left, and vice versa. After 30 seconds, your doctor will quickly lift you into a sitting position. You should not feel any vertigo at this time; if you do, this maneuver can be repeated until you are no longer having vertigo. Sometimes it takes more than one maneuver to get all of your inner ear crystals back into their proper places. Note that, for BPPV on the LEFT side, the same procedure should be performed with the sides reversed. After your appointment with the doctor, you might be given a soft neck brace that you will most likely be instructed to wear for the rest of the day. Your doctor will also give you instructions on how to sleep and move around so that you do not experience vertigo again. These instructions are covered in Part 3 of this article. Summary:","output":"1. Visit a doctor if diagnosed with BPPV and experiencing vertigo. 2. Doctor or therapist perform Epley maneuver to reposition inner ear crystals. 3. Doctor may teach you how to perform the maneuver for future reference. 4. Doctor will seat you on the edge of a table or bed with your head facing forward. 5.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Dreamgirls is a 2006 American romantic musical drama film written and directed by Bill Condon and jointly produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures. Adapted from the 1981 Broadway musical of the same name by composer Henry Krieger and lyricist/librettist Tom Eyen, Dreamgirls is a film a clef, a work of fiction taking strong inspiration from the history of the Motown record label and one of its acts, The Supremes. The story follows the history and evolution of American R&B music during the 1960s and 1970s through the eyes of a Detroit, Michigan girl group known as the Dreams and their manipulative record executive. The film adaptation of Dreamgirls stars Jamie Foxx, Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, and also features Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose and Keith Robinson. Dreamgirls musical supervisors Randy Spendlove and Matt Sullivan hired R&B production team The Underdogs -- Harvey Mason, Jr. and Damon Thomas -- to restructure and rearrange the Henry Krieger/Tom Eyen Dreamgirls score so that it better reflected its proper time period, yet also reflected then-modern R&B/pop sensibilities. During post-production, composer Stephen Trask was contracted to provide additional score material for the film. Several musical numbers from the Broadway score were not included in the film version, in particular Lorrell's solo \\"Ain't No Party\\".  Four new songs were added for the film: \\"Love You I Do\\", \\"Patience\\", \\"Perfect World,\\" and \\"Listen.\\"  All of the new songs feature music composed by original Dreamgirls stage composer Henry Krieger. With Tom Eyen having died in 1991, various lyricists were brought in by Krieger to co-author the new songs. \\"Love You I Do,\\" with lyrics by Siedah Garrett, is performed in the film by Effie during a rehearsal at the Rainbow Records studio. Willie Reale wrote the lyrics for \\"Patience,\\" a song performed in the film by Jimmy, Lorrell, C.C., and a gospel choir, as the characters attempt to record a message song for Jimmy. \\"Perfect World,\\" also featuring lyrics by Garrett, is performed during the Rainbow 10th anniversary special sequence by Jackson 5 doppelgangers The Campbell Connection. \\"Listen\\", with additional music by Scott Cutler and Beyonce Knowles, and lyrics by Anne Preven, is presented as a defining moment for Deena's character late in the film.  After preview screenings during the summer of 2006, several minutes worth of musical footage were deleted from the film due to negative audience reactions to the amount of music. Among this footage was one whole musical number, C.C. and Effie's sung reunion \\"Effie, Sing My Song\\", which was replaced with an alternative spoken version.  The Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture soundtrack album was released on December 5 by Music World Entertainment/Columbia Records, in both a single-disc version containing highlights and a double-disc \\"Deluxe Version\\" containing all of the film's songs. The single-disc version of the soundtrack peaked at number-one on the Billboard 200 during a slow sales week in early January 2007. \\"Listen\\" was the first official single from the soundtrack, supported by a music video featuring Beyonce. \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" was the Dreamgirls soundtrack's second single. Though a music video with all-original footage was once planned, the video eventually released for \\"And I Am Telling You\\" comprised the entire corresponding scene in the actual film. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Alright kiddo, let me tell you something interesting about the movie \\"Dreamgirls\\" from this article. So, the people who made the music for the movie, called The Underdogs, had a big job to do. They had to take the old music from the Broadway show, which was made like a long time ago, and change it so that it sounded good for the people watching the movie. Plus, they added four new songs to the movie that were not in the Broadway show. One of the new songs, called \\"Listen,\\" was sung by Beyonce, who is a very famous singer and also acted in the movie. People really liked the music from the movie, and even the album with all the songs became very popular!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The area of Pizy before the merger was 2.87 square kilometers, while Vinzel had an area of 1.34 square kilometers. The amalgamation led to a larger and more sustainable municipality with an area of approximately 4.21 square kilometers. In terms of population, both municipalities had a relatively small number of residents. At the time of the merger, Pizy had a population of around 218 people, and Vinzel had 297 residents. Consequently, the new municipality's combined population was approximately 515 inhabitants. The primary language spoken in Pizy and Vinzel is French, as it is in the majority of the canton of Vaud. The region boasts a rich Swiss history and is known for its picturesque landscapes featuring vineyards, small villages, and beautiful views of Lake Geneva and the Alps. It is also an agricultural area with a focus on wine production. The merging of municipalities such as Pizy and Vinzel is relatively common in Switzerland, particularly in the 21st century. This consolidation aims at creating sustainable communities by pooling resources, improving infrastructures, and providing better facilities and services to residents without overburdening them with additional taxes. To sum up, the municipality that the former municipality Pizy merged with in Switzerland is Vinzel. This merger took place on July 1, 2011, and was a part of a broader trend of smaller Swiss municipalities consolidating to create more substantial, sustainable, and efficient governing bodies.

Article:","output":"Title: Survey Reveals Cash Bonuses as Top Christmas Wish for Workers Introduction: As the holiday season draws near, businesses are gearing up for their annual traditions: office parties, festive decorations, and, for some, employee gifts or bonuses. But do these companies really know what their workers want for Christmas? A recent survey sought to find out. Step 1: Present the survey details In an effort to uncover what employees truly value during the holiday season, a survey reached out to 2,400 workers to gather their opinions. The participants were asked to choose one of three options: a £250 cash bonus, two additional days of annual leave, or donating £250 to a charity of their choice. Step 2: Highlight the key findings The results of the survey revealed that a significant majority – 57% of the workers – would most appreciate a £250 cash bonus as their Christmas reward. This suggests that a financial incentive remains a powerful tool to boost employee morale and satisfaction. Step 3: Discuss the less popular options On the other hand, it appears that additional time off is not a top priority for most surveyed workers. Only one in ten participants would like to receive two extra days of annual leave as their Christmas gift. This could indicate that, for many employees, the holiday period itself provides sufficient time to rest and recharge. Step 4: Discuss the least popular option Interestingly, a mere 2% of the respondents chose the option to donate £250 to charity. While it is a noble choice, it appears that most workers prioritize their own needs and desires over giving during the festive season. Step 5: Analyze the implications for businesses These survey findings could pave the way for more tailored holiday rewards in the future. Employers seeking to boost employee satisfaction during the festive season may consider providing cash bonuses to their staff in response to the overwhelming preference for financial rewards. Conclusion: The Christmas season offers businesses a unique opportunity to recognize and reward their employees' hard work and dedication throughout the year. This survey highlights the importance of understanding what workers truly value, and in this case, a £250 cash bonus emerged as the clear winner. Offering financial incentives to staff can go a long way in fostering a happy and motivated workforce during the holidays and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: the plot \` surprises  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"Interpreting the positivity or negativity of a statement can be quite challenging as it often depends on context, tone, and interpretation. The statement provided, \\"the plot \`surprises\`\\", is quite neutral or ambiguous on its own. It lacks sufficient context to draw a clear cut conclusion.  If the movie review sentence \\"the plot \`surprises\`\\" is considered in isolation, we cannot definitively state it's either positive or negative. The term \\"surprises\\" alone does not denote a positive or negative connotation. The surprises could be seen as exciting plot twists, which would be considered positive. On the other hand, the surprises could be seen as unexpected and disjointed plot developments, which would be perceived as negative.  However, movie reviews typically contain more information about whether the surprises are evaluated positively, like \\"the plot was full of pleasant surprises\\", or negatively, such as \\"the plot had too many unpleasant surprises, leading to confusion\\". Ideally, if we dive into specifics, we could have validated a more context-based perspective of the term.  In short, the sentence \\"the plot \`surprises\`\\" does not provide sufficient information to establish it as positive or negative. You need more context to categorize the tone of the statement definitively. Typically, movie reviewers will provide more information about how they perceive the \\"surprises\\" in a film's plot, clarifying whether they found them positive or negative.

And now, 102 years on from its heyday, one of the capital's original motorised black cabs is ready to hit the road again after years wasting away in a British barn. The incredibly-rare French-made Panhard-Levassor motor, one of only hundreds made for Britain, was picking up London's upper classes in 1910, and is now up for auction. Toot toot! This incredibly rare original London black cab from 1910 has emerged from a barn in Gloucestershire where it has been languishing for 15 years It was only in the 1930s that the cabs had to be","output":"painted black, making this 1910 model one of the earliest examples of the iconic British vehicle that would later be associated with the dark color. Although it was produced by a French company, Panhard-Levassor, it was designed and built specifically to cater to the British market, particularly the well-to-do clientele in London who no longer wanted to rely on horse-drawn carriages for transportation. At the time, the streets of London were congested with horses and carriages, which were becoming increasingly dated with the rise of motor vehicles. The government was seeking an alternative, and the appearance of this motorized taxicab helped pave the way for the eventual decline of horse-drawn carriages. The Panhard-Levassor cab was unique in its design. It featured a spacious, enclosed passenger compartment that could accommodate up to five passengers. The driver's seat was elevated at the front, providing an unobstructed view of the road and allowing for easier navigation through the crowded city streets. The cab was powered by a 4-cylinder engine, providing a much smoother and more comfortable ride compared to horse-drawn carriages. Despite its age, this 1910 model has aged incredibly well, thanks to being stored in a barn in Gloucestershire, UK, for the past 15 years. It has been mostly protected from the elements and, as a result, the woodwork, brass fittings, and leather are still in excellent condition. The only damage sustained appears to be a dent on the radiator, likely acquired during its heyday in the City. However, this dent adds character to the historical value of the vehicle. After years in storage, the vehicle is ready to return to the road, and enthusiasts will have the opportunity to bid for this classic automobile at auction. The vehicle's pedigree, together with its rarity and historical significance, is expected to fetch somewhere between £30,000-£35,000 (40,000-46,000). If successfully restored and maintained, this 1910 black cab could potentially become an invaluable piece of transportation history. Not only because of its rich past and connection to one of the world's most famous cities, but also as a symbol of the technological advancements that would eventually lead to the eradication of horse-drawn carriages and the birth of the modern taxi industry. In terms of vehicles that have shaped the identity of a city, few are more iconic than the black cab. The Panhard-Levassor motor was in many ways a trailblazer, representing the beginning of an era where motorized transportation became more accessible and commonplace. It symbolizes a time when London began transitioning from a bustling horse-drawn carriage hub into the modern metropolis we know today, making this a truly unique piece of British history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout.

News article: TV Viewership Declining and Streaming on the Rise, Nielsen Says The long-prognosticated death of TV may be happening before our eyes—but at a glacial pace. A new in-depth report from tracking firm Nielsen shows that TV is still by far America’s favorite entertainment past-time, but individuals are spending more hours surfing web and viewing streaming services. A growing number of households are choosing to dump TV altogether. About 2.6 million households are now “broadband only,” meaning they don’t subscribe to cable or pick up a broadcast signal, according to Nielsen’s Total Audience Report, released December 3. That figure comprises about 2.8% of total U.S. households and is more than double the 1.1% of households that were broadband only last year. At the same time, overall viewing of traditional TV is continuing its slow decline. The average person watched about 141 hours of live television per month in the third quarter of 2014, compared to 147 hours in the third quarter of 2013. On a daily basis, viewers are watching 12 minutes less TV than they were a year ago. Overall, 2014 has seen a significantly more precipitous decline in TV viewing than any previous year, Nielsen reports. Not surprisingly, streaming services like Netflix have benefitted from the decline in TV viewing. Forty percent of households now subscribe to a subscription video on demand service such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant Video, up from 35% in 2013. Thirteen percent of households now have a multimedia device like an Apple TV to stream such content. The same percentage of households have smart TVs, which natively stream apps like Netflix. On computers, viewing of online video increased by about 4 hours per month year-over-year to 10 hours and 42 minutes. More viewers are also using DVRs or video on-demand services offered by their cable provider to watch TV after its live airing. Viewers spent 14 hours and 20 minutes per month watching so-called time-shifted TV during the most recent quarter, up from 13 hours and 12 minutes a year ago. It helps to keep these shifts in perspective and recognize that TV isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Overall viewers spend about 14 and a half hours watching video on their phones, computers and multimedia devices, or about a tenth of tenth of the time they spend watching TV. But with CBS having just launched an online version of its channel and HBO prepping a cable-free version of HBO Go for sometime next year, these trends will likely continue to accelerate. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"In simple words, this news article is saying that fewer people are watching TV these days. Instead, they are using the internet to watch movies and shows on websites like Netflix. This change is happening slowly, but more and more people are choosing to not have cable TV at home. As a result, companies like Netflix are growing, and even some TV channels are making their shows available on the internet. So, while TV is not disappearing completely, people are finding new ways to watch their favorite shows and movies without using a traditional TV."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dogs playing in the grass is an ordinary spectacle. Playing is a natural behavior of dogs that serves both physical exercise needs as well as mental stimulation. It serves as a way for dogs to interact with each other, practice social skills, and burn off energy. Dogs also use play to explore their environment, get to know other dogs, and learn about their own abilities and limitations. It can involve a variety of actions, including running, chasing each other, barking, pawing, nipping, jumping, and even wrestling.  Their play may mimic predatory behaviors, as they often engage in activities like stalking, chasing, pouncing, biting, and shaking toys. These actions are typically observed during their play and also their interaction with humans and other dogs.

And then invitations are sent to those who live nearby, their close friends and their relatives who live far away. When everything is ready, then comes the most exciting moment. The wedding itself usually lasts between 30 and 40 minutes. The wedding party enters the church while the wedding march is played. The bride carrying a bouquet enters last with her father who will \\"give her away\\". The groom enters the church from a side door. When the wedding party is gathered by the altar, the bride and groom exchange vows . It is traditional to use the words \\"to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.\\" Following the vows, the couple exchange rings. Wearing the wedding rings on the fourth finger of the left hand is an old custom. After the ceremony, there is often a party, called a \\"reception\\" which gives the wedding guests an opportunity to congratulate the new couple. The car in which the couple leaves the church is decorated with balloons. The words \\"Just Married\\" are painted on the trunk or back window. And then the couple go in their honeymoon. Question: What will the author most probably talk about next? Options: A: The food served in the wedding party. B: The possible places where the new couple spend their honeymoon. C: How to congratulate the new couple. D: The estimated cost of a wedding ceremony.

Help as much as you can. Q:Given the background: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nucl  and the situation: Jeremy is studying the periodic table in preparation for a chemistry test next week. Today he is focusing on the elements that all belong to the alkali metals group. He is especially focused on learning about lithium, which is at the top of the group, and cesium, which is at the bottom of the alkali metals group.  Answer the following question: In which element is the shielding effect larger? A:","output":"The shielding effect is larger in cesium. This is because cesium has more electron shells than lithium and the increased number of inner electrons will result in a greater shielding effect for the outermost electrons. As a result, the attractive force between the nucleus and the valence electron in cesium is weaker, making it easier to remove the electron and leading to a lower ionization energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The President is the highest popularly elected official in Iran, although the President answers to the Supreme Leader of Iran, who functions as the country's head of state. Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates and procedures for election, as well as the President's powers and responsibilities as \\"functions of the executive\\". These include signing treaties and other agreements with foreign countries and international organizations; administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs; and appointing ministers subject to the approval of Parliament. However, in reality the president mainly gets the blame for failures than actually making the decisions. The current long-time Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has been ruling for nearly three decades, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on economy, environment, foreign policy, national planning such as population growth, and everything else in Iran. Khamenei also makes the final decisions on the amount of transparency in elections in Iran, and has fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments.   - Rafsanjan (also Romanized as Rafsanjn and Rafsinjn; also known as Bahrmbd) is a city in and the capital of Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran.

It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.  - Tehran ( \\"Tehrn\\") is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province.

Ali Khamenei succeeded Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian Revolution, after Khomeini's death, being elected as the new Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989, at age 49. Current Iranian president Hassan Rouhani arranged for Khamenei to get his first major post in the provisional revolutionary government as deputy defense minister. Khamenei also served as the President of Iran from 1981 to 1989. In 2012, 2013, and 2014 \\"Forbes\\" selected him 21st, 23rd, and 19th, respectively, in the list of \\"The World's Most Powerful People\\".  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe.

Out of the seventy - nine candidates registered to run , only two were approved by the Council of Guardians , which resulted in a very predictable win by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the previous Speaker of Majlis .  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq.

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran was adopted by referendum on 2 and 3 December 1979, and went into force replacing the Constitution of 1905. It was amended on 28 July 1989. The constitution has been called a \\"hybrid\\" of \\"theocratic and democratic elements\\". While articles One and Two vest sovereignty in God, article six \\"mandates popular elections for the presidency and the Majlis, or parliament.\\" However all democratic procedures and rights are subordinate to the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader, whose powers are spelled out in Chapter Eight (Articles 107-112).  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.  - An Islamic republic is the name given to several states in countries ruled by Islamic laws, including the Islamic Republics of Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and Mauritania. Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956. Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958. Iran adopted it after the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty. Afghanistan adopted it in 1992 (in 19962001 the Taliban was ruling as an Islamic emirate (monarchy)) upon Jamiat-e Islami seizing capital Kabul from the Communists. Despite the similar name the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws.  - Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (or Hashemi Bahramani; 25 August 1934  8 January 2017) was an influential Iranian politician, writer and one of the founding fathers of the Islamic Republic who was the fourth President of Iran from 3 August 1989 until 3 August 1997. He was the head of the Assembly of Experts from 2007 until 2011 when he decided not to nominate himself for the post. He was also the chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council.  - The Assembly of Experts (also Assembly of Experts of the Leadership) of the Islamic Republic of Iran, also translated as Council of Experts, is a deliberative body of Iran consisting of eighty eight (88) Mujtahids (Islamic theologians) that is charged with electing and removing the Supreme Leader of Iran and supervising his activities. Members of the assembly are elected from lists of candidates by direct public vote for eight-year terms. The number of members has ranged from 82 elected in 1982 to 88 elected in 2016. Current laws require the assembly to meet for at least two days every six months. The current chairman of the Fifth Assembly is Ahmad Jannati. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), must be approved by the Guardian Council, while half of its members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. Accordingly, the Assembly has never questioned the Supreme Leader. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Ahmad Azari Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts.  - The Expediency Discernment Council of the System (\\"Majma' Tašxis Malahat Nezâm\\") is an administrative assembly appointed by the Supreme Leader and was created upon the revision to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 6 February 1988. It was originally set up to resolve differences or conflicts between the Majlis and the Guardian Council, but \\"its true power lies more in its advisory role to the Supreme Leader.\\" According to Hooman Majd, the Leader \\"delegated some of his own authority to the council  granting it supervisory powers over all branches of the government\\"  following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election in 2005.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.

A compass is a device with a floating needle (Figure 2.1). The needle is a small magnet. The needle aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field. The compass needle always points to magnetic north. If you have a compass and you find north. You can then know any other direction. See the directions, such as east, south, west, etc., on a compass rose. The Earth has two poles.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who questioned Kündinger about a music career for his son? is inside the article: Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky..., can you guess it ? The answer is:","output":"Ilya"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the following context:  Drake ended his studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered \\"writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge ... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least you have something to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want.\\" Drake spent his first few months in London drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden. On 5 August 1969, Drake recorded five songs for the BBC's John Peel show (\\"Cello Song\\", \\"Three Hours\\", \\"River Man\\", \\"Time of No Reply\\" and an early version of \\"Bryter Layter\\"), three of which were broadcast on the following night.

Folk singer Michael Chapman said of the performances:The folkies did not take to him; [they] wanted songs with choruses. They completely missed the point. He didn't say a word the entire evening. It was actually quite painful to watch. I don't know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren't going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig! The experience reinforced Drake's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person that moved to London in 1969?

Write an article using the following points: Flaws set to be reported at a hacker conference in Hamburg this month. Are in a system called SS7 that allows the world's cellular carriers to route calls, texts and other services to each other. Claims security services could be exploiting flaws.","output":"Title: Flaws in the SS7 System: A Potential Threat at the Hacker Conference in Hamburg Introduction The hacker conference in Hamburg this month is expected to draw attention to the flaws in a system known as Signaling System 7 (SS7). Interestingly, SS7 is an essential technological innovation that serves as a backbone for the world's cellular carriers to interconnect, allowing seamless routing of calls, text messages, and other services across borders. However, as the countdown to the conference kicks off, concerns are mounting over reports of potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities by security services, creating a potentially massive cyber-threat that might compromise user privacy and global communication. The SS7 System: An Overview The Signaling System 7 (SS7) traces its roots back to the 1970s and continues to dominate the telecommunication landscape owing to its efficiency and reliability. It is a set of telephony protocols that enable cellular networks to interconnect and enable functions such as call routing, SMS delivery, and billing. Furthermore, the SS7 system allows varied networks to maintain compatibility and exchange data, irrespective of their geographic location or carrier type. Flaws in the SS7 System During the hacker conference scheduled in Hamburg, several flaws in the SS7 system are set to be unveiled, serving as a wake-up call to telecom companies and cellular carriers. Some of the most significant flaws are: 1. Lack of encryption: The SS7 system was designed before the advent of modern encryption techniques, rendering it vulnerable to cyber-attacks and easy interception. This lack of security could enable malicious intruders to infiltrate the system and target confidential information. 2. Unauthorized access: Since the SS7 system allows different networks to interconnect, cybercriminals could exploit this feature by infiltrating one network and using it as an access point to penetrate other connected networks. This unauthorized access exposes vital user information, calls, and messages to significant risks. 3. Location tracking: The SS7 system also enables the accurate tracking of communication-enabled devices. This location tracking feature can be easily misused by hackers or security services to monitor the movement and whereabouts of individuals, thereby violating user privacy and promoting surveillance purposes. 4. Call and message interception: One of the most alarming flaws in the SS7 system is the possibility of intercepting phone calls, text messages, and metadata. Cybercriminals or malicious entities could exploit this vulnerability to gather sensitive information, eavesdrop on private conversations, and even alter the communication to create confusion or chaos. Potential Exploitation by Security Services In addition to these vulnerabilities that threaten user privacy and global communication, reports suggest that the flaws in the SS7 system could also fall into the hands of security services. In doing so, these agencies would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities for intelligence gathering, mass surveillance, and cyber warfare. The fact that these flaws remain unaddressed gives rise to concerns that perhaps the security services have been using these weaknesses to their advantage, undermining user trust and posing severe ethical questions. Conclusion The hacker conference in Hamburg is a timely reminder that the age-old SS7 system is in dire need of an upgrade, as its flaws pose a significant threat to user privacy, global communication, and overall security. With the vulnerabilities set to be reported at the conference, it is hoped that these revelations compel cellular carriers and telecom companies to prioritize amending these issues. Strengthening the SS7 system from cybercriminals and potential exploitation by security services is essential to ensure safe, secure, and reliable communication for all in today's interconnected world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:Alas poor Hermann, but he wasn't the only one to disappear without trace at Troon's storied par three. Twenty-seven years before Hermann, Gene Sarazen's chances went south when he took five and lost the Claret Jug by one to Arthur Havers. And 74 years after Sarazen, a young superstar was going nicely in the final round of the Open when he fetched-up at the famous par three. Six shots later, Tiger Woods' challenge was done. Designed by Willie Fernie, the Open champion of 1883, given its name by Willie Park Jnr, the Open champion of 1887 and 1889 and refined by James Braid, five-time Open champion between 1901 and 1910,  the Postage Stamp is in the pantheon of great par threes. History? It's all around you out there on the patch of land that is about to host the 145th Open. The tee-box at the top of a dune, a long and narrow green carved out of sand hills. Standing guard, like malevolent sentries, five cavernous bunkers that spell trouble, at best, and death, at worst. Hit it high and the wind might kill it. Hit it low and it's tough to stop it. Hit it short or right or left and you're not quite in Hermann country but you're in a bad place, a circle of hell for some. Talk to a few of golf's best thinkers and many of them smile when the Postage Stamp is mentioned. To them, it's not just a golf hole, it's more than that. It's the way golf should be. We now live in an age where major championship par threes can push on for 300 yards long, and where the game's only answer to technology is to make courses ever longer, ever more brutal. \\"We're losing that skill element in golf,\\" says Paul McGinley. \\"The Postage Stamp is great architecture. It's not about distance, it's about course management, it's about shaping a shot, it's about touch and feel.\\" Thomas Bjorn is of a like mind. \\"It shows that this game doesn't have to be controlled by the equipment,\\" he said. \\"It's not about what's long, it's about what's really well designed.\\" In 2014, BBC Scotland asked 20 top players - who'd won a combined 11 Claret Jugs and almost 400 tournaments worldwide - to name their favourite Open championship hole. It came down to two - the Postage Stamp at Troon and the Road Hole at St Andrews were locked together on six votes each. Rory McIlroy, Ian Poulter, Nicolas Colsaerts, Louis Oosthuizen, Sam Torrance and Stephen Gallacher went with the Road Hole. Ernie Els, Luke Donald, Paul Casey, Paul McGinley, David Howell and Darren Clarke went with the Postage Stamp. The casting vote went to Phil Mickelson. The American went for the par three. \\"Challenging a player for his precision as opposed to solely length is a lost art,\\" said Mickelson at Castle Stuart earlier in the week.  \\"The Postage Stamp is a perfect example of how you can challenge the best players in the world. I would love to see that implemented more.\\" The Postage Stage demands accuracy over length, brain over brawn. It's a tease, a siren with a touch of the devil. In dead calm, it's a birdie hole. In the wind - different story. \\"It was a little dinky eight-iron for me when I played it last week,\\" says Henrik Stenson. \\"Most of the good par 3s in golf are probably ranging between 123 to maybe 180. I'm not a big fan of the new four-iron or three-iron par threes. \\"Of these little ones, the 17th at Sawgrass, the Postage Stamp - you hit a good shot, you make two, you hit a bad one you can walk away with a five. You can have a three-shot swing on a pitching wedge. If you're the kind of fan that wants to see carnage I can highly recommend going out to that eighth hole and sitting in that grandstand on a difficult day.\\" \\"There's going to be carnage,\\" says Graeme McDowell. \\"If the wind blows in the direction I was playing it in last week you're going to have all kinds of numbers. The bunker pin-high right is unplayable. I hit six-iron. The next day I hit eight. It's a very changeable golf hole.\\" Colin Montgomerie spoke about the outward seven holes at Troon and the feeling he gets when he plays them. All relatively downwind, all fairly straightforward. \\"I think, 'OK, I can do this, I can plot my way around here',\\" says Montgomerie. \\"And then you get to the eighth hole and it's the first one that turns into the wind. \\"Even in a practice round you stand up there and it's a potential card-wrecker. Always was and always will be. It does bring to mind the great par threes in the world of golf - Pebble Beach's seventh, the 12th at Augusta, and the eighth at Royal Troon and they're all short holes. \\"It's amazing how one can design a course back in the 1870s and it still stands the test of time today. Fantastic. Nearly 150 years old and it can still generate excitement and drama.\\" McGinley uses the Postage Stamp as an example of not just what a great golf hole should be but as an illustration of how far golf is getting away from artistry. \\"It's just brilliant and it shows that if you get clever green designs and just a bit of thought then you don't need massive length to challenge players. \\"The wind at the Postage Stamp is a big factor, you have a very small target and the margin for error is tiny. You don't have to be far off line for it to be trouble. You have seven or eight yards of width to hit it into. \\"I like watching the ball as it hits the green because that tells you what shape you've put on the shot. Normally it plays a little bit into the wind, in off the right. You need to hold the shot in there, which is a difficult skill with a loft on the club. With loft, it's easier to hook the ball but a lot harder to hold it. That's what creates the skill level. \\"We're losing that skill from the game, absolutely. Firm and fast fairways and greens call for course management and short par threes do the same. We're not seeing course management much any more. \\"The Postage Stamp is all about course management and ball control. It's about who can hold it in that wind, who can play it the right way and create the right spin on the ball so that when it hits the green, it stops. If you get it right, great. If you get it wrong, watch out.\\" There is another way of playing it, of course. Sarazen was 71 years old when he arrived at Troon for the 1973 Open, the 50th time he'd competed for the Claret Jug. In his opening round, he punched a five-iron on to the green at the Postage Stamp and it rolled all the way into the hole for an ace. The day after, the great man found sand off the tee, then promptly holed his bunker shot for a birdie. Sarazen's heroics add to the legend of the hole. Its majesty and danger have long since been written into the folklore of the game. A summary of the above article is?","output":"The Postage Stamp, Troon's famous par three, is known for its challenging course and its focus on precision over length. The course was designed by Willie Fernie, the Open champion of 1883, Willie Park, Jr., the Open champion of 1887 and 1889, and James Braid, a five-time Open champion between 1901 and 1910. Despite its short length and the number of years since its creation, the Postage Stamp continues to generate excitement and drama, showcasing the importance of course management, touch, and feel in the game of golf."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The kidneys receive blood through the renal artery - The blood is passed through the nephrons in the kidneys - The kidneys filter the waste from the blood - The clean blood is circulated out of the kidneys - Excess water and waste is expelled from the kidneys in the form of urine.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person goes through dialysis happens, how will it affect the body is unable to filter urine.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"When a person undergoes dialysis, the process of filtering waste from the blood is artificially carried out by the dialysis machine instead of the kidneys. The perturbation hypothesis in this case is that the body is unable to filter urine because the kidneys are not functioning properly. This is why dialysis is needed: to take over the role of the kidneys in filtering out waste and excess water from the blood. Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis Suppose the person goes through dialysis and their body is unable to filter urine. This suggests that the kidneys are not functioning effectively, and the process of filtering waste from the blood is compromised. Step 2: Identify the changes to the process In this situation, the process of filtering waste from the blood is altered. Instead of the kidneys receiving blood through the renal artery and filtering waste through the nephrons, the blood is now passed through the dialysis machine. Step 3: Analyze the effects of the perturbation on the process The direct effect of the perturbation is that the kidneys are unable to filter waste and excess water effectively. This could lead to a buildup of toxins and water in the body, causing health problems and discomfort. Step 4: Identify the intervention (dialysis) Dialysis is introduced as an intervention to perform the function of the kidneys. Blood is circulated through a dialysis machine, which filters out the waste and excess water, returning clean blood to the body. Step 5: Evaluate the impact of the intervention By performing the role of the kidney, the dialysis machine effectively mitigates the impact of the perturbation. The process of filtering waste and excess water from the blood is not fully hindered, though it is more dependent on an external procedure. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of the kidneys being unable to filter urine does have direct effects on the body's waste filtration process. In response to this perturbation, dialysis can be used to filter waste and excess water from the blood artificially. Dialysis helps maintain the normal function of blood filtration, though it introduces dependency on an external procedure. The perturbation hypothesis influences the process, but the intervention of dialysis mitigates its impact."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose illness led to his death? is inside the article: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works.

It opens at the estate of King Herman the 6 7/8s, the deposed, abeit exiled king of Moronica. Meanwhile, Ixnay, Ohnay and Amscray, the war profiteers from the first film have realized they've made a monster out of Hailstone and his cronies in letting them be too power hungry. They decided that they have had enough of the dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. Herman refuses to accept thier help until he finds out that they were sorry about the whole scenario about wanting to start a war and are willing to pay the price for their actions. To this end, he sends his daughter, the princess Glinda (disguised as Matty Herring in the first film) to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Curly and Larry for a turkey (that is a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey. Larry parodies the attempts to control Greece by saying, \\"I'll wipe out grease.\\") The winner of that battle is a picture of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges.

Justine really hated her brother Gustav","output":"Based on the information provided, it seems inappropriate to infer that Justine, Gustav Mahler's sister, really hated her brother. The fact that Justine named her daughter Alma after Alma Mahler, Gustav's wife, indicates a reference to the connection between the two families, which could imply some sort of admiration or affection for her brother's wife. However, this fact alone cannot establish the presence of a positive or negative relationship between Justine and her brother Gustav. To determine the nature of their relationship, it would be necessary to examine additional information such as personal letters, biographies, and historical accounts of their interactions. The relationship between siblings is complex and can involve a variety of emotions, love, affection, competition, and resentment at different times or simultaneously. Gustav Mahler was a prominent composer and conductor, and his accomplishments could have had varying impacts on his relationship with his sister. It's also important to note that personal relationships within families can be significantly influenced by factors such as family dynamics, shared experiences, and individual personalities.

Given the question \\"Why did Alex do this?\\", is \\"scare people into following his specific laws\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Yes, \\"scare people into following his specific laws\\" is a valid answer, but it is important to explore it in depth to understand the various facets of Alex's motives and the implications of his actions on the people he governed. Alex's choice to govern every person with an iron fist and establish an irrational justice system can be attributed to multiple factors that may have contributed to the development and maintenance of such a regime. Here are some possible reasons for why Alex chose this approach: 1. Centralization of Power: Alex might have sought to maintain absolute control over the governance and decision-making processes. By creating a climate of fear, he sought to eliminate any potential challenges to his authority and guarantee obedient compliance from the populace. 2. Psychological Warfare: By instilling fear among his subjects, Alex could exploit the psychological impact of his rule and create a sense of helplessness among the citizenry. This way, people would unlikely rise up against him, as they would perceive the consequences to be far too dire. 3. Elimination of Opposition: Alex could have been concerned about the influence of different factions, ideologies, or belief systems that may have threatened the stability of his rule. By establishing an irrational justice system, he could arbitrarily target any group or individual that he saw as a potential opponent, thereby solidifying his position of power. 4. Control of Resources: Alex’s tight grip on power might have stemmed from a desire to control the distribution of resources among the population. By employing fear tactics, he effectively prevented people from banding together and demanding a fairer distribution of resources, allowing him to maintain control over valuable assets. 5. Propagation of Ideology: Alex might have believed that propagating his specific values, beliefs, and laws was paramount to the successful continuation of his rule. By controlling the justice system and ensuring that transgressors faced harsh consequences, he sought to create a society founded on his principles. 6. Legacy and Ego: Alex's desire to leave a lasting imprint on history could have driven him to extreme measures. Controlling the population through fear and embedding his ideologies in their lives would ensure that his legacy would persist long after his reign. 7. Insecurity: Alex might have felt insecure about his ability to lead effectively or fear being dethroned by another contender. To mitigate these insecurities, he used fear tactics to suppress any threats to his rule. While the answer \\"scare people into following his specific laws\\" is indeed valid, understanding the diverse and complicated reasons behind Alex's actions helps to create a more comprehensive picture of his motivations for employing an iron fist and an irrational justice system in his governance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Sizable Lutheran missions arose for the first time during the 19th century. Early missionary attempts during the century after the Reformation did not succeed. However, European traders brought Lutheranism to Africa beginning in the 17th century as they settled along the coasts. During the first half of the 19th century, missionary activity in Africa expanded, including preaching by missionaries, translation of the Bible, and education. Lutheranism came to India beginning with the work of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg, where a community totaling several thousand developed, complete with their own translation of the Bible, catechism, their own hymnal, and system of Lutheran schools. In the 1840s, this church experienced a revival through the work of the Leipzig Mission, including Karl Graul. After German missionaries were expelled in 1914, Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous, yet preserved their Lutheran character. In recent years India has relaxed its anti-religious conversion laws, allowing a resurgence in missionary work. In Latin America, missions began to serve European immigrants of Lutheran background, both those who spoke German and those who no longer did. These churches in turn began to evangelize those in their areas who were not of European background, including indigenous peoples. In 1892, the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan. Although work began slowly and a major setback occurred during the hardships of WWII. Lutheranism there has survived and become self-sustaining. After missionaries to China, including those of the Lutheran Church of China, were expelled, they began ministry in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the latter which became a center of Lutheranism in Asia. The Lutheran Mission in New Guinea, though founded only in 1953, became the largest Lutheran mission in the world in only several decades. Through the work of native lay evangelists, many tribes of diverse languages were reached with the Gospel. Answer this question: What happened second: Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous or the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan?","output":"The second thing that happened was Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous.

How do you do this: How do I cut the wood for a hexagon display shelf?","output":"To cut the wood for a hexagon display shelf, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials:    - Wood planks (preferably a hardwood for durability)    - Measuring tape or ruler    - Pencil    - Miter saw or hand saw with a miter box    - Sandpaper    - Wood glue    - Clamps    - Wood finish (optional) 2. Determine the size of your hexagon shelf:    Decide on the length of the sides for your hexagon shelf. Keep in mind that all sides should be equal in length. 3. Measure and mark the wood planks:    Using the measuring tape or ruler, measure and mark the length of the sides on the wood planks. 4. Set the miter saw to 30° angle:    A hexagon requires 6 sides with 120° angles on the inside. To achieve this, you need to cut each side at a 30° angle. Set the miter saw to a 30° angle or use the miter box for a hand saw to make precise cuts. 5. Cut the wood planks:    Carefully line up the wood on the miter saw or in the miter box, ensuring your pencil marks are visible and aligned with the saw blade. Cut the wood planks at the marked points. Repeat this process for all 6 sides. 6. Sand the edges:    Use sandpaper to smooth out the edges of each cut plank. 7. Dry-fit the hexagon:    Before attaching the planks, arrange them on a flat surface to form the hexagon shape. Make sure all the angles and corners are aligned and fit properly. 8. Assemble the hexagon shelf:    Apply wood glue along the edges of the wood planks. Press the planks together and hold them in place using clamps while the glue dries. Allow the glue to dry for the recommended time according to the manufacturer's instructions. 9. Strengthen the joints (optional):    To ensure a stronger shelf, you can reinforce the joints with dowels, screws or with a biscuit joiner. This step is optional but recommended. 10. Apply the finish:    Once the glue is dry and the hexagon shelf is assembled, you can apply the wood finish of your choice. This could be paint, stain, or a clear protective finish. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper application and allow it to dry completely before mounting or using your hexagon shelf. Remember, always use appropriate safety gear and take necessary precautions while working with saws and other tools."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"The claim that the freedom to move is a human right can be supported by various sources of evidence: international human rights law, philosophical arguments, historical developments, and socio-economic benefits. 1. International Human Rights Law: The right to freedom of movement is enshrined in multiple international human rights documents. These include Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which states that \\"everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state\\" and the right to leave and return to one's country. Additionally, Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) protects the right to liberty of movement and the associated freedoms of choosing residence, leaving any country, and returning to one's own country. Such legal provisions emphasize the importance of the freedom to move as an inherent human right. 2. Philosophical Arguments: The philosophical foundation for the right to freedom of movement can be found in the works of various philosophers. For example, John Locke, in his \\"Two Treatises of Government,\\" argued that individuals have a natural right to life, liberty, and property. Freedom of movement is a crucial component of liberty, allowing people to pursue opportunities, escape oppression, and develop relationships with others. Immanuel Kant also maintained that human beings possess inherent dignity, autonomy, and rationality, which entitle them to certain rights, including freedom of movement. 3. Historical Developments: Throughout history, there have been numerous examples of individuals and groups advocating for the right to freedom of movement. This evolution can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Greece and Rome, where limited forms of freedom of movement were recognized for certain citizens. The abolition of slavery and the end of apartheid in South Africa are other significant examples where the freedom of movement was recognized as a fundamental human right. Furthermore, the establishment of the European Union and the Schengen Agreement, which allow free movement between member countries, demonstrates an ongoing commitment to the right to move freely. 4. Socio-Economic Benefits: The freedom to move has numerous socio-economic benefits that support its claim as a human right. Migrants can contribute significantly to the economies of both their host and home countries, promoting cultural exchange, fostering innovation, and enhancing the overall well-being of societies. Moreover, the freedom to move enables people to escape poverty and persecution, thereby enhancing their quality of life and helping to reduce global inequalities. In this sense, freedom of movement not only aligns with humanitarian goals but also promotes social and economic development on a global scale. In summary, the argument that the freedom to move is a human right is supported by various types of evidence. The international human rights law, philosophical underpinnings, historical developments, and socio-economic benefits all contribute to the recognition of the right to move as integral to human dignity, autonomy, and well-being."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(CNN) -- A couple weeks after attending his first United Nations General Assembly meeting as president, Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. What a difference three years makes.  Back in his first months in office, simply being Barack Obama was enough to bring cheering crowds into the street. Whether it was because he was not George Bush or because he was promising to end American policies that were widely despised or whether it was because -- as the first African-American to be elected U.S. president, he embodied an ideal of opportunity for all that was core to this country's appeal -- it hardly mattered. Convene a crowd, and they would find something to like about Barack Obama.  Back then, he seized the moment with great speeches that offered a vision for a new era in American leadership. In Cairo, he spoke of new relations with the Islamic world. In Prague, he spoke of eliminating nuclear weapons. He embraced the G-20 as a mechanism of coordinating the response to the global economic crisis. He didn't bully. He charmed.  Indeed, Obama is probably the first person ever to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize largely for his charm. Or, alternatively, he may be the first person ever to have won the Nobel Peace Prize for the simple achievement of not having been the guy who had the job before him.

Barack Obama was given the Nobel Peace Prize. 2. In his first months in office, simply being Barack Obama was enough to bring cheering crowds into the street. People liked him for various reasons, such as not being George Bush, promising to end widely despised American policies, or embodying an ideal of opportunity as the first African-American president. 3. The article suggests that Obama's charm played a significant role in him being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. His ability to captivate and charm people may have contributed to the decision to award him the prize. 4. Former U.S. Commerce Secretary Pete Peterson once said that one of the secrets to job success is picking the right predecessor. This implies that Obama's success, in part, could be attributed to not being the person who held the position before him (George Bush). 5. Obama used the G-20 as a mechanism for coordinating the response to the global economic crisis. He aimed to tackle the crisis through international cooperation rather than bullying or asserting dominance. 6. In Prague, Obama spoke about eliminating nuclear weapons as part of his vision for a new era in American leadership. 7. The article suggests that if you convened a crowd, people would find something they liked about Barack Obama. His charisma and appeal were undeniable, drawing people to him regardless of their specific reasons. 8. Obama won the peace prize a couple of weeks after attending his first United Nations General Assembly meeting as president. 9. No, the article indicates that Obama did not bully at the G-20. Instead, he took a more diplomatic approach by charming other leaders and fostering cooperation. 10. The article says that Obama promised to end American policies that were widely despised, which contributed to his popularity and widespread appeal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is also the name of the interpreter that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. PostScript. Metafont was devised by Donald Knuth as a counterpart to his TeX typesetting system.  - LaTeX (, also pronounced as , a shortening of Lamport TeX) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to formatted text, as in WYSIWYG word processors like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italic), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. Within the typesetting system, its name is stylised as LaTeX.  - WYSIWYG is an acronym for \\"what you see is what you get\\". In computing, a WYSIWYG editor is a system in which content (text and graphics) can be edited in a form closely resembling its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation.  - BibTeX is reference management software for formatting lists of references . The BibTeX tool is typically used together with the LaTeX document preparation system . Within the typesetting system , its name is styled as (  mathrm ( B (  scriptstyle ( IB ) )  ! T  ! -- (  displaystyle E )  ! X ) ) . The name is a portmanteau of the abbreviation of \`\` bibliography '' and TeX . BibTeX makes it easy to cite sources in a consistent manner , by separating bibliographic information from the presentation of this information , similarly to the separation of content and presentation / style supported by LaTeX itself .  - TeX (or , see below) is a typesetting system (or \\"formatting system\\") designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. Together with the Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces, TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using minimal effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time. TeX is free software, which has made it more accessible to a wider range of users.  - X (named \\"ex\\" , plural \\"exes\\") is the 24th and antepenultimate letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.  - Computer Modern is the original family of typefaces used by the typesetting program TeX. It was created by Donald Knuth with his Metafont program, and was most recently updated in 1992. Computer Modern, or variants of it, remains very widely used in scientific publishing, especially in disciplines that make frequent use of mathematical notation.  - TeX Live is a free software distribution for the TeX typesetting system that includes major TeX-related programs, macro packages, and fonts. It is the replacement of its no-longer supported counterpart teTeX. It is now the default TeX distribution for several Linux distributions such as openSUSE, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and Gentoo. Other Unix operating systems like OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD have also converted from teTeX to TeX Live.  - MiKTeX is a distribution of the TeX/LaTeX typesetting system for Microsoft Windows. It also contains a set of related programs. MiKTeX provides the tools necessary to prepare documents using the TeX/LaTeX markup language, as well as a simple tex editor: TeXworks.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose from: [A]. no. [B]. yes.","output":"[A]. no. The two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks for an explanation on how to play Orbiter Space Flight Simulator, while the second question addresses the rarity and expensiveness of travel to low earth orbit after 50 years of manned space flight. Below are detailed answers for both questions: 1. How do I play Orbiter Space Flight Simulator? Orbiter is a free space flight simulator that allows you to explore the solar system in realistic spacecraft. To play the game, you'll need to first download and install it on your computer. Follow these steps to get started: Step 1: Download and Install Orbiter Go to the official Orbiter website (http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) and download the simulator. It is available for Windows operating systems. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Step 2: Familiarize Yourself with Orbiter Controls and Interface Launch the Orbiter application and familiarize yourself with the interface. You will see a 3D view of the Earth, as well as a range of controls and menus that allow you to configure your spacecraft, select different views, and access other options. Take some time to explore the interface and read the documentation provided with the game to learn about the various features and settings. Step 3: Choose a Spacecraft and Starting Scenario From the main menu, you can select a spacecraft and a starting scenario. Scenarios range from simple orbital flights to complex interplanetary missions. Select a scenario that matches your experience level and interests. Step 4: Launch and Control Your Spacecraft Once you've chosen a scenario, the simulator will place your spacecraft in the starting position. Use your keyboard, mouse, or joystick (depending on your preference and setup) to control your spacecraft's orientation, engines, and systems. Step 5: Follow the Mission Objectives As you progress through your flight, you will have a set of mission objectives to complete. These can include orbiting the Earth, docking with a space station, or landing on a celestial body. Follow these objectives and use the controls and instruments at your disposal to successfully navigate and complete your mission. Step 6: Practice and Experiment It's important to practice and experiment with different scenarios and spacecraft to become proficient at the game. The more you play, the more you will learn about orbital mechanics, spacecraft systems, and the intricacies of space flight. 2. Why is it that after more than 50 years of manned space flight, travel to low earth orbit is still so rare and expensive? There are several reasons for the rarity and high cost of manned space flight to low earth orbit: Cost: The expense of building, launching, and maintaining a spacecraft capable of manned spaceflight remains very high. The cost of fuel and materials, as well as the specialized workforce required for developing and operating a spacecraft, contributes to the overall expense. Technology: Building a spacecraft capable of safely carrying humans to low earth orbit requires advanced technology and stringent safety measures. Ensuring a reliable and safe vehicle for manned missions adds complexity and drives up costs. Access to space: Governments and space agencies tightly control access to space. The infrastructure for space launches is limited to a few places globally, and the services are mainly reserved for military, scientific, and commercial purposes. Risk: Manned space flight carries inherent risks, including the potential for accidents or failures. These risks necessitate extensive testing, training, and safety measures, which adds to the overall cost. Demand: The demand for manned spaceflight is relatively low. The market has so far focused primarily on satellite launches and scientific or military missions. The recent development of commercial space travel, led by companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, is beginning to reshape the landscape, but it's still in the early stages. Despite these challenges, efforts to lower the cost of access to space and increase the frequency of manned space flight continue. Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are developing reusable spacecraft to bring down costs and make space travel more accessible. As progress continues, it's possible we will see an increase in manned low earth orbit flight opportunities in the coming years."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who declared amnesty on 11 October? from the following article ?  The 1740 Batavia massacre (Dutch: Chinezenmoord, literally \\"Murder of the Chinese\\"; Indonesian: Geger Pacinan, meaning \\"Chinatown Tumult\\") was a pogrom in which Dutch East Indies soldiers and native collaborators killed ethnic Chinese residents of the port city of Batavia  (present-day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies. The violence in the city lasted from 9 October 1740 until 22 October, with minor skirmishes outside the walls continuing late into November that year. Historians have estimated that at least 10,000 ethnic Chinese were massacred; just 600 to 3,000 are believed to have survived. In September 1740, as unrest rose among the Chinese population, spurred by government repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would be met with deadly force. On 7 October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar River and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11 October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22 October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area. The following year, attacks on ethnic Chinese throughout Java sparked the two-year Java War that pitted ethnic Chinese and Javanese forces against Dutch troops. Valckenier was later recalled to the Netherlands and charged with crimes related to the massacre. The massacre figures heavily in Dutch literature, and is also cited as a possible...

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - A preseason fan favorite is reportedly headed to Philadelphia. The Eagles signed Saints running back Boston Scott to their active roster, according to Ian Rapaport of the NFL Network. The Saints selected Scott in the sixth round of the 2018 draft. He's spent the season on the Saints' practice squad. Hypothesis:  Boston Scott did not play in NFL games this season for the Saints.","output":"Drawing from the provided context, it is reasonable to formulate the hypothesis that Boston Scott did not play in NFL games this season for the Saints. The supporting evidence for this hypothesis can be found in various elements of the context: 1. Boston Scott's history with the Saints: As per the given information, Scott was selected by the Saints in the sixth round of the 2018 draft. This means that he was a fairly recent addition to the team, and more specifically, a part of their player lineup since the 2018 draft. 2. Practice squad participation: The text mentions that Scott spent the season on the Saints' practice squad. A practice squad is essentially a group of players who are part of a team but not part of the active roster, meaning they do not usually play in official games. Instead, they practice with the team, helping prepare them for upcoming matches by simulating the roles of opposing players. This aspect is a strong indication that Scott did not play in any NFL games this season for the Saints, as practice squad players generally do not take part in official games. 3. Signing with the Eagles: Following his stint with the Saints' practice squad, Scott was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to their active roster. This piece of information signifies a change in Scott's status, moving from the practice squad of the Saints to the active roster of the Eagles. An important implication of this change is that his previous role as part of the practice squad most likely did not involve participating in official games for the Saints this season. Combining these factors, it is rational to draw the hypothesis that Boston Scott did not play in NFL games this season for the Saints. His involvement in the practice squad rather than the active roster, coupled with his departure to become an active player for the Eagles, suggests that his role during the season was primarily centered around practice and not official game participation. Although the context does not explicitly state that Scott did not play any games for the Saints, this hypothesis is consistent with and strongly supported by the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the California police code for homicide) on every page in a textbook. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv. Fifteen months after surviving, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" ChacÃ³n, a felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect. The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he disappears, and Benny's unstable tag partner, CÃ©sar, takes over as leader.

Let's explore both options you've provided and think about some detailed scenarios within each: Option 1: Scatter Them Everywhere This approach is all about spreading objects loosely and casually throughout a given area. There are many ways to scatter things practically, especially if we're talking about vast physical or digital spaces. Here are a few points to consider: - Consider what you're spreading: If these are physical objects, ensure that they won't get damaged or cause harm to someone. If these are digital files or data, ensure they are backed up and not in danger of being lost or misplaced.  - Define your space: It's essential to consciously decide where objects will be scattered, whether it be a room or a digital hard drive. This helps keep the process manageable.  - Casual scattering: Especially pertinent when aiming for an aesthetic flair, scattering things naturally and casually can create an appealing visual look. - Purposeful scattering: This involves a more careful placement, trying to intermix different types of objects for variety or to instill a sense of randomness.  - Remember where everything is: When scattering things, ensure you have a rough idea of where things are. It may be useful to document placements especially for essential or valuable items. Option 2: Keep Them In One Spot Keeping things in one spot pertinently suggests a state of organization and preservation. These things may be physically tangible or digitally intangible. Here are some methods: - Sort and Organize: Keep things that are similar together. This will help you find them later and it’s easier to remember where things are if they are grouped.  - Use Containers: If you're dealing with small physical goods, a box or basket is a great way to keep all the items together. For digital files, you can create a special folder. - Label Everything: If you have lots of things, it's easy to forget where you kept each item. Labeling each item or groups of items can help you remember and find them later.  - Regular Maintenance & Updates: Keeping things in the same spot doesn't mean just dumping them there. Regular review of what's there, updating the labels, and removing obsolete or unnecessary items can help to keep everything in order.  - Order Based On Frequency of Use: Place the items you use most often at the front or on top, so they're easy to access right away. - Protect Your Items: Keep them in one spot also means to store the objects in a safe, appropriate environment. Things should be stored in conditions that prevent any damage or loss. There isn't a correct answer between the two options you provided. Both ways have their advantages and the ideal method would heavily depend on the context, the nature of the items, the available space, and the intended goal you have in mind when managing those items."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Certainly! The given sentence in German, \\"Beispielsweise hätte dieser Vorschlag früher vorgelegt werden müssen,\\" translates to English as: \\"For example, this proposal should have been submitted earlier.\\" Let's break down the translation: - \\"Beispielsweise\\" means \\"for example\\" or \\"for instance.\\" It is an adverb that is commonly used to provide an example or a specific instance of a more general idea or concept. - \\"hätte\\" is a conjugation of the German auxiliary verb \\"haben\\" (to have) in the subjunctive mood. In this case, it is being used to express a hypothetical situation, an action that should have happened, or a missed opportunity. - \\"dieser Vorschlag\\" translates to \\"this proposal\\" in English. \\"Dieser\\" is a demonstrative pronoun that agrees with the gender and case of the noun it's connected with. In this case, \\"Vorschlag\\" is a masculine noun in the nominative case, so \\"dieser\\" is used. - \\"früher\\" means \\"earlier\\" or \\"before.\\" It is an adverb that indicates that the action should have taken place at an earlier point in time. - \\"vorgelegt\\" is the past participle of the German verb \\"vorlegen\\" (to submit, present, or submit for consideration), which conveys the act of presenting or submitting a document or proposal. - \\"werden müssen\\" is a combination of \\"werden\\" (a modal verb used to form the passive voice) and \\"müssen\\" (a modal verb meaning \\"must\\" or \\"to have to\\"), indicating an obligation or necessity to perform the action expressed by the main verb in the sentence.

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David.

Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of High Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven.

Movie title: The Town Context: Four lifelong friends from the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, Douglas \\"Doug\\" MacRay, James \\"Jem\\" Coughlin, Albert \\"Gloansy\\" MacGloan, and Desmond \\"Dez\\" Elden, rob a bank. They take the manager, Claire Keesey, hostage, but release her unharmed. When they find out Claire lives in their neighborhood, Doug begins to follow her to find out how much she has told the authorities, and to make sure that Jem does not eliminate her as a witness. Soon a romance grows between them, which Doug hides from the gang. As they grow closer, Doug tells Claire of his search for his long-lost mother, whom he believes went to live with his aunt in Tangerine, Florida. He also recounts his chance to be a professional hockey player which he threw away for a life of crime, following in his father's footsteps. She in turn tells Doug that she saw a tattoo on one of the robbers, and he realizes that she can identify Jem and send them all to jail. He knows that Jem will kill her if he discovers the truth, so he persuades her that the authorities cannot protect her, and she decides not to tell the police. After Claire tells Doug about being harassed and her car vandalized by Alex, a local thug, Doug enlists Jem for a favor, which they can never talk about. Doug and Jem don hockey masks and violently assault the offenders without Jem knowing the true reason for the favor is to protect Claire. FBI Agent Adam Frawley surveils the gang and recognizes their ties to local crime lord Fergus \\"Fergie\\" Colm, who has another robbery planned for them. During a visit to his father Stephen in prison, Doug reveals his plans to leave Boston and go to Florida. The gang's next robbery in the North End goes awry, and the gang barely escapes. The gang is interrogated by Frawley, but he fails to get any confessions and is forced to release them. Doug asks Claire if she will go away with him, and she agrees. When Frawley learns that Claire quit her job, he wiretaps her phone, and threatens to prosecute her as an accomplice after realizing that she is seeing... A:","output":"In the movie \\"The Town,\\" Jem (James Coughlin) did not throw away any specific opportunity for a life of crime. Instead, it is Doug MacRay, one of Jem's lifelong friends and fellow bank robber, who had the chance to be a professional hockey player but chose a life of crime instead, following in his father's footsteps. Doug develops a romantic relationship with Claire Keesey, the bank manager they once took hostage. As their relationship progresses, Doug shares his regrets about not pursuing a hockey career and getting involved in criminal activities. Doug's decision not only led him to a life of crime but also put him in a difficult position when he discovers Claire can identify Jem by his tattoo, potentially leading the whole gang to jail. Doug aims to protect Claire from Jem by persuading her not to report her knowledge to the authorities. Additionally, Doug enlists Jem's help to deal with a local thug harassing Claire, further complicating the situation as Jem is unaware of Doug's true motives regarding Claire. Through a series of events, including more robberies, interrogations, and involvement with a local crime lord, Doug eventually reveals his plan to leave Boston and go to Florida while also trying to take Claire away from the dangerous situation they find themselves in. As a result, Doug's life of crime not only costs him his dream of being a professional athlete but also puts the lives of himself and those around him, such as Claire, in perpetual danger. In conclusion, it is important to note that it was Doug MacRay, not Jem Coughlin, who threw away an opportunity (in this case, a professional hockey career) for a life of crime. This decision and its consequences play a significant role in the storyline and character development of \\"The Town.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Finnish:","output":"Siksi pyysimme komissiolta viime vuonna ehdotusta Euroopan laajuiseksi verkko-uhkapelien sääntelykehykseksi. Tästä syystä olemme siis pyytäneet komissiota tekemään ehdotuksen Euroopan laajuiseksi verkko-uhkapelien sääntelypuitteiksi jo viime vuonna. Haluamme varmistaa, että verkko-uhkapelien markkinat ovat avoimet, reilut ja puolueettomat kaikille jäsenmaille ja niiden kansalaisille, samalla suojellen kuluttajia ja estäen mahdolliset väärinkäytökset. Tavoitteena on luoda yhteiset säännöt ja standardit verkko-uhkapelien alalle yhdenmukaisen Euroopan laajuisen lähestymistavan mukaisesti. Näin voimme taata eri jäsenvaltioiden lakisääteisten rajoitusten ja kansallisten käytäntöjen yhteensopivuuden, samalla kun varmistamme kuluttajien ja uhkapelien tarjoajien suojelemisen. Verkko-uhkapelien sääntelypuitteiden toteuttamisessa Euroopan laajuisesti on olennaista ottaa huomioon myös eri jäsenvaltioiden kulttuuri- ja sosiaalipoliittiset näkökohdat. Tämä tarkoittaa esimerkiksi sitä, että jokaisen maan on voitava määrätä omista peliensä sosiaalisista, kulttuurillisista, taloudellisista ja muiden politiikanalojen päämääristä. Lopullisen sääntelykehyksen on kuitenkin oltava avoin ja joustava, jotta erilaisten uhkapelien tarjoajat voivat kilpailla oikeudenmukaisesti Euroopan laajuisilla markkinoilla. Tämä edistää innovaatiota ja parhaiden käytäntöjen jakamista alalla, ja auttaa näin lopulta kuluttajia hyödyntämään entistä laajempaa ja turvallisempaa uhkapelitarjontaa. Komission esittämän Euroopan laajuisen verkko-uhkapelien sääntelykehyksen tulee mahdollistaa yhdenmukaisen lainsäädännön kehittäminen kaikissa jäsenvaltioissa. Sen tulee myös seurata ja valvoa uhkapelien tarjoajien toimintaa, jotta voidaan estää petoksia, rahanpesua sekä muita laittomia toimintoja ja samalla turvata kuluttajien oikeudet ja tarjota heille turvallinen peliympäristö. Ehdotuksen mukaan Euroopan laajuinen verkko-uhkapelien sääntelykehyksen tulisi sisältää useita tärkeitä osa-alueita, kuten yhtenäisten pelilisenssien myöntämisen, kuluttajansuojan parantamisen, petostentorjunnan ja yleisen valvonnan, uhkapelien markkinointiin liittyvien säännösten ja rajoitusten kehittämisen sekä vastuullisen pelaamisen edistämisen ja tuen tarjoamisen ongelmapelaajille. Näiden toimenpiteiden avulla voimme luoda tehokkaan ja oikeudenmukaisen Euroopan laajuisen verkko-uhkapelien sääntelyjärjestelmän, joka hyödyttää sekä jäsenvaltioita että niiden kansalaisia ja edistää samalla koko Euroopan talouden ja digitaalisen sisämarkkinoiden vahvistumista."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Who will win the presidential election? No usual answers on Labor Day 2016 Every four years, Labor Day means more than just the end of summer: it’s also the end of high uncertainty in a presidential election, and the time when candidates start to see their real chances. Or at least that’s what it used to mean. The surrealism of 2016 – a former secretary of state, who ran eight years ago and is married to a former president who was almost impeached, running against a reality TV show celebrity with a mediocre business record and alleged history of sexual harassment – has finally started to ebb. Voters will have the two least popular presidential candidates in decades on their ballots, and there’s still a great deal of uncertainty about how that unpopularity will affect their decisions. One number holds many clues about how we ended up here: 42%. That’s the share of Americans who identify as independent, according to Gallup’s most recent analysis. That number is the highest Gallup has ever seen since it started measuring political inclination in 1988, and it’s considerably higher than the share who now identify as Democrats (29%) or Republicans (26%). Understanding independents is key to understanding how Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump became hugely popular. Independents are also crucial for understanding how Hillary Clinton’s support might be overstated in current polls. Currently, Clinton is the most likely candidate to win the 2016 presidential election, according to analysts who rely on polls. At the time of writing, the New York Times projects that she has a 86% chance of winning in November, and FiveThirtyEight puts her chances at 69%. But these probabilities don’t take into account the fact that polls have become plagued by systemic issues, from low response rates to media biases, that have made them sometimes unreliable. What’s more, in polling (much like every other type of human interaction), it’s hard to tell whether people mean what they say. Are Trump supporters reluctant to share their views when a stranger from Ipsos, Rasmussen or Gallup calls them up? If so, Clinton could be in trouble. Forecasting the political future means considering not one probability but many possibilities. Here are the three most likely outcomes in this election. Over the past 20 years, there are just 19 states that have flipped between the two main parties at least once. Of those, around two-thirds are likely to be closely fought contests this year: Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Iowa, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire. Clinton’s hopes rest on voters choosing her and those who might vote Trump staying home. Clinton’s rhetoric in the coming months will be important for securing these victories. The former secretary of state needs to convince former Bernie Sanders supporters that she shares the values that galvanized so many young voters. Similarly, Clinton needs to persuade voters that she is the only way Americans can keep Donald Trump out of the White House. Like Clinton, Trump needs to focus his energies on mobilizing supporters to actually go to the polls. Although demographics don’t seem to work in his favor (his supporters make up a relatively small fraction of the overall electorate) it is quite possible that Trump’s support is understated in polls. Polling analysis appears to privilege left-of-centre ideas (and many of the journalists who interpret polls, including this journalist, may be viewing the numbers with a misplaced optimism) which helps explains why forecasts about the British EU referendum, the Israeli election and the Scottish independence referendum were all off the mark. There’s another factor in this election which may well work in Trump’s favor: third party candidates. Between them, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein stand to pick up 11% of the national vote. Votes for Johnson and Stein appear more likely to erode Clinton’s vote share than Trump’s. Those third-party candidates have a slim chance of making it to the presidential debates (they need to be polling with at least 15% of the national electorate’s support to qualify), meaning Trump will want to sow what doubt and frustration he can in Democratic-leaning voters, in order to convince them to stay home or vote for a third party candidate. Sexism could also benefit Donald Trump. In a survey of more than 2,000 US adults in 2014, only 74% of women and 58% of men agreed that there are not enough women in positions of power. The mere fact this is a possibility shows just how much uncertainty there is around this election. And it is a real possibility, even though more than 20 years have passed since anyone won by a double-digit margin. For a start, the distribution of US electoral college votes privileges the Democratic party. Together, Democratic “safe” states (those that have voted Democratic consistently in the past six presidential elections) yield 242 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. States that Republicans can reliably count on have 102 electoral votes. As a Democrat and a seasoned politician, Clinton is the most likely candidate to represent continuity in the minds of many voters. Past elections have also shown that even after contemplating the different options, voters tend to revert towards the status quo in the final days before casting their ballot. Then again, this is no ordinary election. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the presidential election and how it's hard to know for sure who will win.

Choose your answer from: [+] description [+] entity [+] abbreviation [+] human [+] numeric [+] location","output":"The answer to the question \\"Why do some people have two different color eyes?\\" would be a description. This is because the answer entails an explanation detailing the underlying factors, biological processes, or genetic causes that give rise to the phenomenon of having two different colored eyes in some individuals. Heterochromia, as this condition is called, occurs for various reasons. It can be divided into three types: complete heterochromia, sectoral heterochromia, and central heterochromia. Complete heterochromia is a rare condition in which an individual has two completely different colored irises. This can be due to genetic factors or chromosomal abnormalities. For instance, a person might inherit genes for blue eyes from one parent and brown eyes from the other. This genetic variation could result in one blue eye and one brown eye. Sectoral heterochromia refers to the presence of two or more colors in a single iris. This can occur when the distribution of the pigment melanin is uneven in the eye, resulting in patchy areas of varied coloration in the iris. Central heterochromia, on the other hand, is characterized by an iris with a different color near the pupil compared to the rest of the iris. This can be attributed to the differences in the concentration and dispersion of the pigments that define eye color.  In addition to genetic factors, there can also be acquired cases of heterochromia, which occur later in life due to injury, eye surgery, a medical condition, or the use of certain medications. Overall, the answer to this question is not an entity, abbreviation, human, location, or a numeric value.

Write highlights for this article: You don't find many churches making theatrical films. You especially don't find many churches making films starring Kirk Cameron about a firefighter in a crumbling marriage addicted to online porn. Kirk Cameron stars in \\"Fireproof,\\" a film he was attracted to for its many themes, he said. But that's the case for Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia. In fact, the film, \\"Fireproof,\\" was the church's third movie. It was also an unexpected hit. In September it debuted at No. 4 at the box office, eventually bringing in 33.5 million and spawning two books: a novelization, also called \\"Fireproof,\\" which is in The New York Times' best-seller list's Top 20; and a companion journal to the movie, \\"The Love Dare,\\" which has sold more than 2 million copies. Last week \\"Fireproof\\" debuted on DVD and climbed to No. 3 on Billboard's DVD chart, beating out \\"The Hulk\\" and \\"Saw V,\\" among others. \\"You don't often see movies made by churches do big numbers,\\" said Billboard's Anthony Colombo. \\"Having [distributor] Sony behind it helps. Having Kirk Cameron helps, but for it to come out and do 136,000 pieces [DVDs] in its first week is pretty impressive.\\" \\"It should not be working,\\" said Alex Kendrick, one of the pastors behind the film. \\"All I can say is we prayed for months and asked for it to honor God.\\" Kendrick said that Sherwood's pastors gathered for prayer two years ago and asked God to give them an idea for their next movie. They were just coming off making \\"Facing the Giants,\\" a movie shot entirely in Albany on a 100,000 budget. It starred no professional actors -- just members of their church -- but made 10.2 million at the box office and sold 250,000 copies on DVD, launching the church into the national spotlight. The church leaders lit upon the idea of troubled relationships. \\"Families and marriages are crumbing and we want to do something about it,\\" said Kendrick, recalling the idea's genesis. \\"God give us the idea. We had no clue what would happen with it.\\" \\"Fireproof\\" began with a 500,000 budget and a fresh crop of church member/actors, but the film got a left-field boost when Cameron, best known as the 1980s heartthrob from the TV series \\"Growing Pains,\\" read the script and asked to get involved. \\"All throughout the movie ... there are issues of communications, money, sex, addiction, porn, extramarital affairs, feeling respected at work but not at home, feeling respected by friends but not at home,\\" Cameron told CNN. The themes resonated with the actor and devout Christian, a husband of 17 years, and father of six, he said. That and the \\"cool action scenes,\\" he added. The makers of \\"Fireproof\\" tapped into the church market, arranging screenings for the National Baptist Pastors' convention before release and using word-of-mouth among church leaders. However, says Cameron, the film was pitched to general audiences, not necessarily Christians. \\"'Fireproof' was never marketed as a Christian movie. This is a movie about marriage,\\" Cameron said. \\"The fact is, though, the gospel is presented, is done well, and it's a central part of the storyline.\\" Although many critics panned \\"Fireproof\\" -- \\"as sincere, uncynical and subtlety-free as a Sunday school lecture,\\" said Variety -- audiences embraced it. \\"There's a huge market out there that's underserved. That market is there and a lot of people don't want to go there but there is a huge untapped market,\\" Cameron said. Paul Dergarabedian, a box office analyst for Hollywood.com, said he was shocked when the movie debuted in the top five its opening weekend. \\"With 'Fireproof,' they really cracked the code with the major success with the film and have this appeal across the board,\\" he said. \\"They didn't follow traditional marketing methods but they didn't need them for this film. ... Maybe that's why it worked out so well.\\" He added, \\"You're talking about a very successful property. ... The powers that be that put this together are really on to something.\\" Churches are using \\"Love Dare\\" and its companion curriculum as a teaching tool, says publisher B&H Publishing's Andrea Dennis, who calls \\"Fireproof\\" \\"a marriage movement.\\" For Valentine's Day more than 9,000 churches are scheduled to show the film, many displaying the admonition \\"Fireproof Your Marriage\\" on their signs. B&H believes \\"Love Dare\\" could hang around on the best-seller list -- where it's already been for 19 weeks -- along the lines of Rick Warren's \\"The Purpose Driven Life.\\" And the filmmakers have kept their success close to home. Alex Kendrick said the church used the profits from the movie to buy 82 acres of land and build a recreation center for the town, equipped with eight tennis courts, eight basketball courts and an equestrian area. A baseball diamond is on the way.

In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated.

Place a clean chopping board on the sidewalk and stretch the  dead snake out head side up  on the chopping board, use a clean sharp smooth large knife to chop the head off with a swift chop .. (II). Place a clean chalk board on the sidewalk and stretch the dead snake out head side up  on the chalk board, use a clean dull smooth large knife to chop the head off with a swift chop..","output":"Option I: Place a clean chopping board on the sidewalk and stretch the dead snake out head side up on the chopping board, use a clean sharp smooth large knife to chop the head off with a swift chop Here is a step-by-step process on how to accomplish this goal: 1. Ensure safety first: To ensure your own safety, wear protective gloves and goggles before handling the dead snake. Dead snakes can still have venomous fangs, and the possibility of getting scratched or bitten exists. 2. Gather necessary tools: You will need a clean chopping board and a large, clean, sharp, smooth knife. Make sure the knife is sharp to avoid the need for multiple chops and to minimize the chances of slip-ups. 3. Step by step instructions:   a. Find a suitable area: Select an appropriate area to perform this task on the sidewalk. Ensure it is a flat, stable surface, and free of any potential hazards.   b. Place the chopping board: Lay out the clean chopping board on the selected area.   c. Prepare the snake: Using your protective gloves, hold the dead snake carefully, and stretch it out with its head facing upwards on the chopping board. Ensure the snake's head is lying firmly against the chopping board's surface.   d. Chop the head: Hold the knife firmly with both hands while maintaining a secure grip. Position the knife above the snake's neck, just behind the head. With a swift and controlled motion, chop the head off the snake by bringing down the full force of the knife. Be sure to cut through the snake's spine and any muscle or tissue for a clean removal of the head.   e. Dispose of the snakehead: Once the head is successfully removed, safely dispose of it by placing it in a sealed container or plastic bag. 4. Cleanup: Clean and sanitize all the tools and equipment used in the process, including the chopping board, knife, gloves, and goggles. Dispose of the snake's body properly, abiding by any local regulations on animal disposal. In contrast, Option II involves using a clean dull smooth large knife and a chalkboard as the surface. This method is not recommended because: 1. A dull knife requires more effort and multiple chops, raising the risk of accidents or injuries. 2. A chalkboard is not suitable for this task as it may break under the force of the chop, potentially causing shards to scatter and creating a hazardous environment. 3. Chalking boards are porous, meaning they can harbor bacteria or grime, leading to unsanitary conditions in the process. In conclusion, the best and safest method for accomplishing the goal of removing the head from a dead snake is Option I – using a clean, sharp, smooth large knife and a clean chopping board. Make sure to follow proper safety guidelines and dispose of the snake's head and body accordingly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Korolev was born in Zhytomyr, Russian Empire. His father, Pavel Yakovlevich Korolev, was born in Mogilev to a clerk of the Imperial Russian Army and a peasant mother. His mother, Maria Nikolaevna Koroleva (Moskalenko/Bulanina), was a daughter of a wealthy merchant in the city of Nezhin with Cossack heritage. On his maternal side, in addition to Cossacks, he also had Greek and Polish ancestry. Korolev received vocational training in carpentry and in various academics at the Odessa Building Trades School (Stroyprofshkola No. 1). Enjoyment of a 1913 air show inspired interest in aeronautical engineering. Korolev began designing a glider as a diversion while studying for his graduation exams at the vocational school. He made an independent study of flight theory, and worked in the local glider club. A detachment of military seaplanes had been stationed in Odessa, and Korolev took a keen interest in their operations.  In 1923 he joined the Society of Aviation and Aerial Navigation of Ukraine and the Crimea (OAVUK). He had his first flying lesson after joining the Odessa hydroplane squadron and had many opportunities to fly as a passenger. In 1924 he personally designed an OAVUK construction project glider called the K-5. He briefly trained in gymnastics until his academic work suffered from this distraction. Korolev hoped to attend the Zhukovsky Academy in Moscow, but his qualifications did not meet the academy's standards. He attended the Kiev Polytechnic Institute's aviation branch in 1924 while living with his uncle Yuri, and earning money to pay for his courses by performing odd jobs. His curriculum was technically oriented, and included various engineering, physics and mathematics classes. He met and became attracted to a classmate, Xenia Vincentini, who would later become his first wife. In 1925 he was accepted into a limited class on glider construction, and suffered two broken ribs flying the training glider they built. He continued courses at Kiev until he was accepted into the Bauman Moscow State Technical University (MVTU, BMSTU) in July 1926.  Korolev studied specialized aviation topics until 1929, while living with his family in the typically crowded conditions of Moscow. Korolev enjoyed opportunities to fly gliders and powered aircraft during this part of his education. He designed a glider in 1928, and flew it in a competition the next year. The Communist Party accelerated the education of engineers in 1929 to meet the country's urgent need for their skills. Korolev obtained a diploma by producing a practical aircraft design by the end of the year. His advisor was the famous Andrei Tupolev.","output":"The text is about Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, a prominent rocket engineer and spacecraft designer in the Soviet Union during the 20th century.

It is over thirty kilometres long and in places nearly 300 meters deep. It is cold and dark and not many people went there until after 1930. Then a road was made around the lake. Holiday makers began to use the road, and this was when the stories began. Someone said that he had seen a monster in the lake. He said it was twelve meters long. It had a long neck and a small head. Then someone else said he had seen it. Others said the same thing and in 1933 a London doctor took a photo. It looked like a monster with a long neck and a thick body but the photo was not dear. The newspapers printed the picture and called it the Loch Ness monster, or \\"Nessie\\". Then the argument began. Some people, however, were certain there was something living in the lake. Others said there was nothing there. In 1961, a lot of people joined together to make a real effort to see and photograph the monster if there was one! Several times people thought they saw something but after ten years there was still no real proof. Later underwater television cameras were used, but no one found any real proof. However, they did find something interesting: a huge underwater cave. It was big enough to be home of a monster, but of course, this was not a proof. In 1975, however, some American scientists formed a search group. They used an underwater camera. It took pictures every seventy seconds. Some of the pictures seemed to show a red-brown creature. Its body was about four meters long and had a very ugly head on the end of a four meter neck. Many people then began to believe in the monster. But even today we can not be certain.

Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost.

It is approximately in length, and it stretches east from the town of Vejle at its head to the towns of Trelde Næs on the south side and Juelsminde on the north side at the mouth. The fjord's generally calm surface waters are surrounded by low forested hills shaped by glaciers during the last ice age.  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - In engineering, a truss is a structure that \\"consists of two-force members only, where the members are organized so that the assemblage as a whole behaves as a single object\\". A \\"two-force member\\" is a structural component where force is applied to only two points. Although this rigorous definition allows the members to have any shape connected in any stable configuration, trusses typically comprise five or more triangular units constructed with straight members whose ends are connected at joints referred to as nodes. In this typical context, external forces and reactions to those forces are considered to act only at the nodes and result in forces in the members that are either tensile or compressive. For straight members, moments (torques) are explicitly excluded because, and only because, all the joints in a truss are treated as revolutes, as is necessary for the links to be two-force members.  - A box or tubular girder is a girder that forms an enclosed tube with multiple walls, rather than an or H-beam. Originally constructed of riveted wrought iron, they are now found in rolled or welded steel, aluminium extrusions or prestressed concrete.  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - Jutland , also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula , is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east.  - A cantilever bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported on only one end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large cantilever bridges designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - A bridge is a structure built to span physical obstacles without closing the way underneath such as a body of water, valley, or road, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.  - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland.  - Vejle is a town in Denmark, in the southeast of the Jutland Peninsula at the head of Vejle Fjord, where the Vejle River and Grejs River and their valleys converge. It is the site of the councils of Vejle Municipality (\\"kommune\\") and the Region of Southern Denmark. The city itself has a population of 54,862, making it the ninth largest city in Denmark. Vejle Municipality has a population of 111,743. The city is part of the Triangle Region, which includes the neighbouring cities of Kolding and Fredericia.  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).  - Falsework consists of temporary structures used in construction to support spanning or arched structures in order to hold the component in place until its construction is sufficiently advanced to support itself. This usage is specifically called centering. Falsework also includes temporary support structures for formwork used to mould concrete to form a desired shape, scaffolding to give workers access to the structure being constructed, and shoring which is temporary structural reinforcement used during repairs.  - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper.  - Structural steel is a category of steel used as a construction material for making structural steel shapes. A structural steel shape is a profile, formed with a specific cross section and following certain standards for chemical composition and mechanical properties. Structural steel shapes, sizes, composition, strengths, storage practices, etc., are regulated by standards in most industrialized countries.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Vejle Fjord Bridge ( Danish : Vejlefjordbroen ) is a cantilever bridge that spans Vejle Fjord between Mølholm and Nørremarken near the town of Vejle in Denmark . The bridge is 1712 metres long , the longest span is 110 metres , and the maximum clearance to the sea is 40 metres . The bridge has 15 spans . Vejle Fjord Bridge was built to lead traffic past the town of Vejle , where traffic congestion had become a problem in the 1970s . The building started in 1975 , and the bridge was opened on July 1 , 1980 . It cost 350 million kroner . The bridge now has more traffic than any other highway bridge in Denmark .  - Prestressed concrete is a concrete construction material which is placed under compression prior to it supporting any applied loads (i.e. it is \\"pre\\" stressed). A more technical definition is \\"\\"Structural concrete in which internal stresses have been introduced to reduce potential tensile stresses in the concrete resulting from loads.\\"\\" This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength \\"tendons\\" located within or adjacent to the concrete volume, and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service. Tendons may consist of single wires, multi-wire strands or threaded bars, and are most commonly made from high-tensile steels, carbon fibre or aramid fibre. The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied, the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces, and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces. This can result in improved structural capacity and/or serviceability compared to conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations. Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved concrete performance can allow longer spans, reduced structural thicknesses, and material savings to be realised compared to reinforced concrete. Typical applications range through high-rise buildings, residential slabs, foundation systems, bridge and dam structures, silos and tanks, industrial pavements and nuclear containment structures.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016).  - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands).    What is the relationship between 'vejle fjord bridge' and 'vejle municipality'? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Vejle Fjord Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans across the Vejle Fjord, located in Denmark. This bridge connects the areas of Mølholm and Nørremarken near the town of Vejle. Vejle Municipality is a municipality in the Region of Southern Denmark, which includes the town of Vejle.

Sentence 2: IRS have a top of the line computer system. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"If the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be true at the same time, given that both sentences make contradictory statements about the IRS computer system. The first sentence states that the IRS fails to collect 150 billion a year in owed taxes, majorly due to its antiquated computer system, which is too primitive to effectively catch frauds. This implies that their computer system is outdated and inefficient at fulfilling its purpose, which is to collect due taxes and prevent tax fraud. The second sentence, however, states that the IRS has a top-of-the-line computer system. A top-of-the-line system refers to a system that is technologically advanced, cutting-edge, and highly efficient in its objectives. This is directly contradictory to the information provided by the first sentence. Thus, both sentences cannot be true simultaneously. If the first sentence is true, that would mean the IRS's computer system is outdated and unable to effectively catch frauds, so it cannot be considered a top-of-the-line system as claimed in the second sentence.

On the first play of the game, Matt Schaub completed a pass to Jacoby Jones, who proceeded to go for an 80-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Arian Foster had a 78-yard touchdown reception from Schaub, and the Texans were in control of the game throughout. Josh Freeman threw three interceptions, two of which led to touchdowns for Houston.  Question: How many yards were gained on Jacoby Jones' and Arian Foster's longest touchdown scored?  Answer type: Number  Student:","output":"To answer this question, I will find the number of yards gained on Jacoby Jones' longest touchdown and the number of yards gained on Arian Foster's longest touchdown from the passage and add them up. First, I will locate the information about Jacoby Jones' longest touchdown: \\"On the first play of the game, Matt Schaub completed a pass to Jacoby Jones, who proceeded to go for an 80-yard touchdown.\\" From this, I can see that Jacoby Jones' longest touchdown was 80 yards. Next, I will locate the information about Arian Foster's longest touchdown: \\"In the second quarter, Arian Foster had a 78-yard touchdown reception from Schaub.\\" From this, I can see that Arian Foster's longest touchdown was 78 yards. Now I will add up both distances to find the total number of yards gained on their longest touchdowns: 80 yards + 78 yards = 158 yards.

This sweat then moves up through the ducts and is released onto the surface of the skin. Once it is on the skin's surface, the sweat starts to evaporate (change from a liquid to a gas). The evaporation of sweat helps to remove excess heat from the body, as the process of evaporation requires energy (in the form of heat) to occur. When sweat evaporates, it absorbs heat from the skin and the surrounding air, which leads to a cooling effect on the body. This cooling effect helps to lower the body's temperature back down to a more normal range, around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). As the body's temperature decreases, the hypothalamus senses this change and stops sending messages to the sweat glands to produce more sweat. This feedback loop enables the body to maintain its normal temperature range and prevent overheating or heat-related illnesses. In summary, the final step of the process is the evaporation of sweat, which helps regulate the body's temperature back to a more normal range: around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius)."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process:  - Sugar enters the body - Bloodstream - The pancreas - Insulin lower sugar levels - Bloo sugar goes back to normal.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of infected cells in the person's body can have an indirect effect on the process of regulating blood sugar levels. When the body is fighting off an infection, it often triggers an inflammatory response and the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which can raise blood sugar levels. Additionally, illness can decrease the body's sensitivity to insulin, leading to a need for more insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. In this situation, the body may require more insulin production or other forms of intervention to regulate blood sugar effectively, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions like diabetes.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who was ill for several weeks?  The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.

How does metal rust? Rust is what happens when some metals, like iron or steel, are exposed to water and air for a long time. It's a reaction between the metal, oxygen, and water which creates a reddish-brown substance called rust. Rust is not good for the metal because it weakens it, and that's why we often try to protect metals from rusting. 2. Is rust a metal? Rust is not a metal by itself, but it forms from metal when it reacts with oxygen and water. So, we can say that rust is related to metal, but it's actually a different substance that's created when metal gets in touch with air and water. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these two questions are not the same. The first one is asking about how the rusting process happens, and the second one is asking if rust itself is a metal.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

It sends nerve impulses to the diaphragm through the autonomic nervous system. The brain stem monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. If the level becomes too high, it “tells” the diaphragm to contract more often. Breathing speeds up, and the excess carbon dioxide is released into the air. The opposite events occur when the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes too low. In this way, breathing keeps blood pH within a narrow range.

Information:  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Homogenic is the third international solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of \\"Homogenic\\" was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. \\"Homogenic\\" was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. \\"Homogenic\\" marked the first of several production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the \\"Billboard\\" 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart.  - \`\` Alarm Call '' is a song by Björk released as the fourth single from her fourth studio album Homogenic , peaking at # 33 in the UK . The sped - up \`\` radio version '' of the song ( which was also featured in the video ) was used in the 1999 film The Mod Squad .  - One Little Indian Records is a London-based independent record label that rose from the ashes of punk rock record company Spiderleg Records. It was set up in 1985 by members of various anarcho-punk bands, and managed by former Flux of Pink Indians bassist Derek Birkett.  - Trip hop is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Björk Guðmundsdóttir (born 21 November 1965), known as Björk, is an Icelandic singer, songwriter, producer, DJ, and actress. Over her four-decade career, she has developed an eclectic musical style that draws on a wide range of influences and genres spanning electronic, pop, experimental, classical, trip hop, IDM, and avant-garde styles. She initially became known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Sugarcubes, whose 1987 single \\"Birthday\\" was a hit on US and UK indie stations and a favorite among music critics. Björk embarked on a solo career in 1993, coming to prominence as a solo artist with albums such as \\"Debut\\" (1993), \\"Post\\" (1995), and \\"Homogenic\\" (1997), while collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects.   - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom. It was published for the first time on 22 July 1956 and is compiled every week by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on Fridays (previously Sundays).

I attend the symphony series, the chamber music series, and the ballet.  I've enjoyed some of the greats in music and dance there. The staff and volunteers are cordial and efficient.  I also attend the Salon series that showcases rising young talent who have earned prestigious awards.  This is a fun series.  The seating is limited and on the stage, up close and personal with the artist.  Prior to the performance, champagne and finger foods are served.  The food is exquisite.  After the performance, coffee and truffles or petit fours are served.  It's a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon.  The Promenade shop offers an array of esoteric items ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime.  Intermezzo offers some tasty sweets and savories and a yummy Jamaican coffee blend.  Only complaint here is that they only have one cashier which slows things down, especially during intermissions.  I do remember fondly the old Intermezzo that had an even wider array of decadent sweets to delight the palate and destroy the waistline.  And then there is the Stage 5 Bar.  I have sampled several of their wine offerings and can only say that I have never been able to go beyond one sip.  I have abandoned further attempts with the wine and moved on to my old standby cocktail, the Black Russian.  There is a young lady who frequently tends bar there who makes the best Black Russian.  I've yet to try the food platters at Stage 5, although I have seen them.  Meager portions.  It seems, however, that they are always out of the one(s) I want.

You can make the images in your flipbook animation one of several ways:  Draw them by hand. If you do this, start with simple images (stick figures) and backgrounds and gradually tackle more complex drawings. You'll need to take care that the backgrounds are consistent from page to page to avoid a jittery appearance when you flip the pages. Photographs. You can take a number of digital photos, then print them out on sheets of paper and bind them together, or use a software application to create a digital flipbook.

Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Justice for Josey\\" Synopsis: \\"Justice for Josey\\" is a gripping and powerful drama that revolves around the pursuit of justice in a small town where corruption, violence, and misogyny are deeply ingrained. The movie follows Josey Chambers, a young woman who is trying to rebuild her life after a horrific sexual assault. The journey Josey embarks on leads her down a path of anger, betrayal, and redemption, ultimately bringing the men responsible for the heinous act to justice. Plot: Josey Chambers (27) moves to the quiet town of Lindenwood to escape her traumatic past, seeking solace in its serene landscapes. She gets a job at the local café and manages to make some new friends, including Sarah (30), a domestic abuse survivor advocating for women's rights.

Process:  - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue -   suppose less acid rain lands happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body's cells.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. First, let's clarify what acid rain is and how it lands. Acid rain is a term used to describe rain, fog, or snow that is more acidic than normal due to various air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), released from fossil fuel combustion. These pollutants react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and other acidic compounds. When these acidic compounds fall to the earth's surface in the form of precipitation, it is referred to as acid rain. Now, we will analyze how less acid rain could affect the process of oxygen being brought to the body's cells: 1. Decreased acid rain could result in fewer air pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere. This could lead to an improvement in the overall air quality, making it much cleaner and healthier to breathe. Breathing cleaner air could indirectly enhance the process of transporting oxygen to the body's cells. 2. With less acid rain, there would be a potential reduction in pollutants dissolving in water sources. This could lead to improved water quality, which is indirectly beneficial to human health and the oxygen transportation process. Increased water quality could indirectly support better respiratory health and further enhance the process of oxygen transport to the body's cells. 3. Moreover, acid rain can have a negative impact on vegetation and soil health, affecting the overall ecosystem. With decreased acid rain, the ecosystem, including plants, would be healthier. Since plants produce oxygen during photosynthesis, healthier plants could contribute to an increase in oxygen availability. This could indirectly enhance the process of oxygen transport to the body's cells. In conclusion, while less acid rain may not directly impact a step of the process involved in the transportation of oxygen to the body's cells, it can have indirect benefits that could contribute to improved air and water quality, healthy ecosystems, and increased oxygen availability. These factors could collectively help enhance the overall process of oxygen transportation in the human body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All of the models of hybrid car will save money, but are they really effective when all of the costs of maintenance and other considerations are included in? First of all, consider the cost of buying a hybrid vehicle. Depending on the model, hybrid vehicles can cost anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 more than the traditional models. However, some say that as the hybrid cars become increasingly more available as a reflection of demand, the prices can be expected to drop, making them more cost effective when it comes to the initial investment. Also important to keep in mind is the fact that the hybrid cars have a much more specialized system than the standard vehicle, and will therefore require more specialized workers to repair them when they break down. It seems as though, at least for the time being, the purchase of a hybrid vehicle for the average consumer may not be the best choice when it comes to saving money. It is important to keep several things in mind, however, when considering purchasing a hybrid model. Many consumers are choosing to purchase these cars because they represent a significant development in terms of environmental concerns over standard models. They also mean that as a whole, Western nations will become less dependent on oil as the only means of power. Finally, it is necessary to remember that the hybrid car is a very new technology. Developed only within the last few years, the technology is still in the starting stage, where costs will continue to be high. As time passes, the development of the hybrid technology will begin to push prices down to the point where hybrids are more competitive with the traditionally fueled models of the past. What do we know from the passage? A) The hybrid technology is very new and mature as well. B) It's not easy to repair a hybrid car due to its special system. C) Many average consumers can not afford to buy hybrid cars. D) The traditional vehicles are much safer to drive than hybrid cars. Answer:","output":"B) It's not easy to repair a hybrid car due to its special system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose piece is now called the Festive Symphony? ?  Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech...

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect.

I recently came across an intriguing article that detailed the intoxicating, risk-filled lifestyle of the Enron Corporation during its heyday and thought it would pique your interest. As a company that was once hailed as a shining example of corporate innovation and success, the article recounts the dark side of this corporate giant that ultimately led to its spectacular implosion. The article delves into the party-hard, work-harder mentality that permeated through Enron's halls. With an insatiable appetite for risk, Enron executives engaged in not just high-stakes financial gambling, but also indulged in creating an environment rampant with excesses such as sex, money, and unbridled ambition. The story is a classic cautionary tale of corporate greed and immorality that eventually transcended Enron, bringing about significant changes to corporate governance in the United States and across the globe. One striking revelation in the article was the astounding lack of oversight and corporate governance within the company. Enron executives fostered a culture of deception, where illegal transactions were constantly masked as legitimate business activities. They manipulated earnings reports and accounting methods, all the while fooling investors, employees, and regulatory bodies alike. Beyond the wide-ranging financial scandals that plagued the company, the article also highlights the brazen attitude many of Enron's executives had toward sex and personal relationships. Stories abound of extramarital affairs, wild parties, and a near-endless supply of carnal pleasures that many executives partook in, all the while justifying their actions as part and parcel of the Enron lifestyle. Despite its rapid ascension to success, Enron's foundations were fragile at best. Fueled by esoteric financial engineering and rampant ethical misconduct, the company's reign was ultimately short-lived. The fallout from the company's bankruptcy in 2001 had far-reaching consequences, not just for the thousands of employees who lost their jobs and pensions, but it also led to the fall of its auditor, Arthur Andersen, and more stringent regulations like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This article serves as a stark reminder of the consequences that can befall even the mightiest of corporations when corporate greed and short-term gains supersede values of transparency, accountability and ethics. While it may be tempting to engage in risky and thrilling pursuits, the fallout from such enterprises can have long-lasting, devastating effects for individuals and organizations alike. I highly recommend giving this article a read and discussing this in our next team meeting as a lesson on corporate ethics and governance. It is essential for us to learn from history to make better choices as our organization forges ahead in this highly competitive business landscape.

Whole life insurance, or whole of life assurance (in the Commonwealth of Nations), sometimes called \`\`straight life'' or \`\`ordinary life,'' is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date. As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies. Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age. The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65. Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies. does whole life insurance expire at a certain age?","output":"Whole life insurance is like a special kind of agreement between you and the insurance company.

Assuming that:  Smaller tributary glaciers, like tributary streams, flow into the main glacier in their own shallower U-shaped valleys. Answer:","output":"If the size of the tributary stream were to be increased, the valley created by the tributary stream would likely become deeper.  Step 1: Understand the context Tributary streams are smaller streams that flow into a larger, main river system. When tributary glaciers flow into the main glacier, they carve out their own U-shaped valleys. Step 2: Consider the effect of the size increase An increase in the size of the tributary stream implies an increase in the volume of water flowing through it. This would lead to an increase in the erosional power of the stream. Step 3: Erosional power and valley formation The erosional power of a stream is a significant factor in shaping the landscape. Higher erosional power allows the stream to erode more material from the valley floor and walls, deepening the valley in the process. Step 4: Conclusion Given the increase in the size of the tributary stream and its resultant increase in erosional power, we can conclude that the valley would likely become deeper as the stream continues to erode and shape the landscape in which it flows."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is also a highly skilled race car driver, but is sometimes haunted by memories of her father's death at a NASCAR race many years ago. Meanwhile, on another side of town, Carlo (Nathan Phillips) has just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq. He meets up with his brother Jason (Jesse Johnson) before heading to Vegas themselves. Carlo is not happy that Jason is living with their mob boss uncle Michael D'Orazio (Angus Macfadyen), whom he always sees as the cause of their family's destruction. Little do they know that Michael has been running an unsuccessful counterfeiting ring and owes millions of dollars to another syndicate led by the \\"Godfather\\" (David Dayan Fisher). On the outskirts of Vegas, a high-stakes race event is being held, with Michael, Infamous, Hollywood producer Jerry Brecken (Tim Matheson) and Chinese businessman Marcus Cheng (Michael Hagiwara) placing their bets over who has the better car. When Infamous' driver fakes an ankle injury, Natasha becomes Infamous' driver in exchange for 300,000 and a recording contract. However, she is unaware that Infamous has to place her on his wager, as Michael - who has been obsessed with her since watching her band perform on stage earlier - has placed four platinum bars at stake. At the same time, Brecken wagers his brand-new Enzo Ferrari on Natasha. Natasha (driving a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren) takes on Jason (driving a Lamborghini Diablo). As they approach the finish line, Natasha is several car lengths ahead of Jason, but he quickly zips past her by engaging the onboard nitrous system. Unfortunately, because of the excessive speed, the Diablo loses downforce, flies off the ground and flips in mid-air before crashing upside down at the finish line.

The chaos ensuing amidst the political upheaval provided these opportunists the cover to unleash their sinister intentions, taking advantage of a moment of vulnerability. However, it is crucial to address pervading societal issues that enable a dangerous culture of sexual harassment and assault, prevalent not only in Egypt but also globally. It is high time that people from all walks of life come together and acknowledge the deep-rooted systemic problems that allow for such heinous acts to occur. Education and awareness are key to creating a safer world, where women can express their rights without the fear of being targeted or harmed. In my interview with CNN, I hope that sharing my story brings attention to the shocking reality that countless women and girls face every day, all around the world.

Movie title: Raging Bull Movie plot: In a brief scene in 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine. The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late.

Guy Heinze Jr. faces eight counts of first-degree murder in last month's killings in a Georgia mobile home.  Guy Heinze Sr., 46, was granted the award by the McIntosh County, Georgia, Magistrate Court in a suit over a mobile home that he owned, court officials said. He had not received the money as the ruling was under appeal.  Heinze was found dead August 29 in his Brunswick mobile home along with six others. An eighth person died later at a hospital.

The amendment language “prohibits the federal government from doing business with ZTE or Huawei or other Chinese telecom companies\\" and puts the company back on the sanctions list and \\"holds ZTE accountable for violating their previous commitment.\\" | Getty Senate will try to reverse ZTE deal via a must-pass defense bill      Senate leaders agreed Monday to include language in the annual defense spending bill that would reverse the Trump administration's decision to save Chinese telecommunications company ZTE after it was caught violating the terms of a 2017 penalty agreement by making illegal sales to Iran and North Korea.      The move is a rebuke to President Donald Trump on the eve on his summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, after Trump had pledged to China’s leader that he would try to save the state-controlled company from a crippling sanction. The language will be part of an amendment in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, a 716 billion defense policy bill, H.R. 5515 (115).      Story Continued Below      “By including this provision to undo the ZTE deal in the defense bill, the Senate is saying loudly and in a bipartisan fashion that the president is dead wrong to back off on ZTE,\\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \\"The fact that a bipartisan group of senators came together this quickly is a testament to how bad the Trump administration's ZTE deal is and how we will not shy away from holding the president's feet to the fire when it comes to keeping his promise to be tough on China.\\"      \\"Great news! Our bipartisan amendment restoring penalties on #ZTE is included in the #NDAA bill the Senate will be advancing to later this evening,\\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) added on Twitter.      Great news! Our bipartisan amendment restoring penalties on #ZTE is included in the #NDAA bill the Senate will be advancing to later this evening. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 11, 2018      The action came just days after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced that the administration had reached a deal with ZTE that would allow it continue to operate. Ross met with the senators late Monday afternoon to brief them on the new settlement.      In April, Ross had initially imposed a seven-year ban on the company from doing business with American firms after it was caught violating the terms of its 2017 penalty agreement. However, at the request of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who feared the original penalty would put ZTE out of business, Trump directed Ross to come up with another option.      That came last week, when Ross announced ZTE had agreed to pay an additional 1 billion fine, change its management team and add a new team of sanctions compliance officers chosen by the United States in exchange for the ban being lifted. Ross also said the Trump administration had not received any commitments from China in return.      \\"I and obviously every other senator believes the death penalty is the appropriate punishment for their behavior,\\" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told reporters after Ross briefed senators on the department's latest ZTE action. \\"They’re a repeat bad actor that should be put out of business.

If the Senate amendment becomes law, \\"I would expect there wouldn't be a ZTE,\\" Cotton added.      Ross did not try to talk senators out of the amendment nor did he seem displeased during Monday's classified briefing, Cotton said.      The Arkansas Republican added that he did not believe Trump would veto the legislation because of its many other priorities. The ZTE provision is part of a broader package of \\"manager's amendments\\" that will be added to the defense deal at the start of debate.      “I’ll be voting for the amendment,” Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, told reporters after the briefing. “It really is based out of the concerns that China is using communications companies as a means to conduct espionage.”      Not every lawmaker emerging from the briefing came away committed to Cotton’s amendment.      Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, declined to say whether he would support the language. “One side of the equation,” Johnson said of the briefing. “We need more information from the intelligence community.”      But Sen. John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the chamber, described his colleagues as “being very cautious” on how they approach ZTE and that including the amendment in the manager’s package reflects confidence in its congressional backing.      “I suspect there was enough support for what they’re trying to do here,” Thune said.      On Monday, the Senate overwhelmingly voted to formally start debate on its version of the fiscal 2019 National Defense Authorization Act after several early setbacks.      The House has already finished work on its version and the two bodies will have to work out any differences before sending the final package to Trump for his signature.      If the Senate amendment becomes law, it would automatically reinstate the seven-year prohibition until Trump has certified to Congress that ZTE has met certain conditions. It also would ban all U.S. government agencies from purchasing or leasing telecommunications equipment and/or services from ZTE, a second Chinese telecommunications firm, Huawei, or any subsidiaries or affiliates of those two companies.      The amendment language “prohibits the federal government from doing business with ZTE or Huawei or other Chinese telecom companies\\" and puts the company back on the sanctions list and \\"holds ZTE accountable for violating their previous commitment,\\" Cotton said.

A bipartisan amendment was added to the National Defense Authorization Act that reinstitutes penalties against ZTE for violating U.S. sanctions against exporting to Iran and North Korea, and bans U.S. government agencies from purchasing any of the company's devices or services.      \\"It's only prudent that no one in the federal government use their equipment or services and that they receive no taxpayer dollars,\\" Sen.

The deal implemented a 1 billion penalty against ZTE and required the addition of a U.S.-chosen compliance team to monitor the company. It also required ZTE to change its board of directors and executive team within 30 days.      Cotton suggested if the bill is passed by the Senate and signed by Trump, the amendment would likely force ZTE out of business by blocking the deal.      \\"ZTE said they couldn't remain in business, or at least not remain anything other than a cellphone hand-held business, if the denial order from March was in effect.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that is made into a statue in the grotto?, using the article: With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement.  On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\\"Fountain of the Artichoke\\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi.  During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the façade, the prototype of the cour d'honneur that was copied in France.

Not only do the storylines in \\"The Sopranos\\" engage audiences from all over, but I think (for me at least) what brings the viewers back is the acting. (Not even you, Gary, can dispute that claim) James Gandolfini, who plays the lead-man, Tony Soprano, has become (in this viewer's opinion) one of the \\"Hollywood Elites\\" as far as acting in a television series goes. I wouldn't go ahead and compare him with Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino, or at least, not just yet. He, however, does do a hell of a job playing the part of Tony Soprano. In the years since 1999, Gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor (mainly thanks to his role in The Sopranos) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business. And it's not just him. \\"The Sopranos\\" fields a great supporting cast including that of Lorraine Bracco, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Dominic Chianese, and the late Nancy Marchand who played Tony's dreadful mother. At this point in the show's existence, it's being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so. The first two seasons were extraordinary. Violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner, but without a doubt, extraordinarily done. The third season was great, but didn't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2. Season 4, which wrapped up right before new-years, was the weakest season yet (or at least, in my opinion it was). Despite a dry-spell, I still found it (season 4 of \\"The Sopranos\\") to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that's saying a lot because lately I've been noticing a trend in good new television shows. Examples of this: Six Feet Under, The Shield, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and OZ (which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year). To get back to my point though, to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year, no less, is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers. \\"The Sopranos\\" ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit. To close, I'd like to say, \\"The Sopranos\\" is the real deal folks.

So to find out how many percent of people were not African American, we can subtract that number from 100%. 100% (total population) - 11.1% (African American population) = 88.9% So, 88.9% of people in Nassau County were not African American."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please add spaces between words: paymentperiodstendtoincreasein","output":"The string you've provided: \\"paymentperiodstendtoincreasein\\" can be segmented and spaced out to form the following phrase: \\"Payment periods tend to increase in\\". This sentence seems to be incomplete as it must be followed by some context or object after the preposition \\"in\\". However, based on the given phrase, we can assume that it is discussing the observation or trend that the durations of payment periods, which may refer to the time spans within which obligations must be paid, often show an increasing tendency.  This might be applicable in various contexts such as in financial or lending institutions where the timeframe given to borrowers to fulfill their payment responsibilities may be extended due to numerous possible reasons. For instance, in a turbulent economy marred by financial crises, lenders may choose to prolong the durations of payment periods to alleviate the burden on the borrowers and increase the likelihood of them being able to meet their obligations.  This trend could also be present in business to business (B2B) transactions, wherein suppliers might extend the payment periods for their clients due to reasons such as establishing long-term relationships, showing goodwill, or securing business continuity.  Another example could be in the realm of credit card companies, where to attract more clients, these companies may offer longer payment periods, allowing customers to defer their payments to a later date without the pressure of immediate repayment. Therefore, the phrase \\"Payment periods tend to increase in\\" suggests a notion of growing leniency in the temporal aspect of payment policies across various contexts. However, the specific conditions or factors contributing to this increase would be dependent on the context and what follows after the preposition \\"in\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Footage shows police shooting motorbike thief Dramatic helmet cam footage has emerged showing a thief brandishing a gun while trying to steal a motorbike in Sao Paulo, Brazil, before being shot in the leg and stomach by a military police officer. Escarante Leonardo Santos, 35, was taken to hospital for emergency surgery, where his condition has not yet been confirmed, Folha reports. The video, shot at around 3pm Saturday, shows a gloveless rider overtaking cars at high speed on his Honda Hornet before coming to an intersection, when the thief attempts his armed robbery. Santos, wearing dark sunglasses, a salmon shirt and a yellow cap, jumps off the back of an accomplice’s Honda Twister and points a .38 caliber revolver at the rider, telling him to hand over the bike and not to worry as he’s not a cop. However, a military police officer who was returning from work was parked in the opposite direction and saw the robbery taking place. The police officer foils the robbery by then shooting the Santos and disarming him, while his accomplice rides off and escapes. According to a Civil Police statement, \\"preliminary analysis of the video suggests that the action of the military police was legitimate and correct, with the observance of police techniques...(It) clearly shows that the robber pointed his gun towards the police officer.\\" The actions \\"demonstrated commitment to public cause, defending society from violent criminals,\\" the statement said.

By late 1759, Alaungpaya had massed a force of 40 regiments  at Yangon. Of the 3000 cavalry, 2000 were Manipuri \\"Cassay Horse\\", who had just been press-ganged into Alaungpaya's service after the Burmese conquest of Manipur in 1758. The Burmese battle plan was to go around the heavily defended Siamese positions along the Three Pagodas Pass-Ayutthaya corridor. They selected a longer but less defended route: Go south to Tenasserim, cross the Tenasserim Hills over to Gulf of Siam, and turn north to Ayutthaya. To that end, the Burmese had assembled a fleet of 300 ships to transport a portion of their troops directly to the Tenasserim coast. Alaungpaya was to lead the invasion personally, and his second son Hsinbyushin was his second-in-command. His first son Naungdawgyi was left to administer the country.  Also in his service were his top generals including the likes of Minkhaung Nawrahta who like all Burmese leadership had plenty of military experience.

There are three people present. 2. These people are watching the boy from a park bench. 3. A young boy is the subject of their attention. 4. The boy interacts with an antique airplane, specifically touching its propeller. Now, let's examine the given hypothesis: The people watch a boy touch the airplane.

The boy is touching an airplane (it does not specify which part or if the airplane is antique). By comparing the premise to the hypothesis, we can observe several similarities, such as the presence of people, the focus on a young boy, and the boy's interaction with an airplane. The only differences are the absence of the number of people and the specification of the airplane's propeller and age. The differences in details do not invalidate the hypothesis because it still encapsulates the core aspects of the original premise. The primary focus of the hypothesis remains consistent with the premise, which reflects people observing the boy as he touches an airplane.

Whatever the case, moving rarely comes at a convenient time and involves so many variables that it is difficult to exhale until all of the documents are signed. Even then, that point in the process instantaneously starts a whole new chapter in the book of moving. No matter how long it takes to sell (or not sell) your previous home, whether you’re able to find your dream kitchen or settle for less, if you’re moving down the street, across the country, or around the world, the act of moving can be completely overwhelming. Long story short: Moving is a process. In the midst of all the uncertainties, there are a few ways to stay organized while moving. This short list is meant to guide you through steps to keep you on track during a stressful time. The largest piece of advice I can give you is to start by decluttering your current living space. Having less to deal with will help you feel more in control of the situation. Finding a realtor that you trust and feel comfortable working with will put your mind at ease (most of the time) about the process of listing your house and finding a buyer. Let your realtor do the work for you so you can concentrate on keeping your home “show ready” and begin to look at options on the other side of the move, like where you’ll be working, spending your time, and researching schools or neighborhoods. Make a list of people you’ll need to update contact information with once you leave. This should include any and all businesses you frequent or subscribe to, like pest control services, lawn maintenance, even all of your neighborhood loyal buyer programs you participate in. Do not overlook your banks, investment companies, retirement funds, healthcare providers for you and your family members, and even you pets. And, of course, family and friends.

Information:  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved.  - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions:  - Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ; Sundanese: ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region) Census released in December 2015, Java is home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the most populous island on Earth. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.  - Borneo is the third-largest island in the world and the largest island in Asia. At the geographic centre of Maritime Southeast Asia, in relation to major Indonesian islands, it is located north of Java, west of Sulawesi, and east of Sumatra.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.  - Sumatra is a large island in western Indonesia that is part of the Sunda Islands. It is the largest island that is entirely in Indonesia (two larger islands, Borneo and New Guinea, are shared between Indonesia and other countries) and the sixth-largest island in the world at 473,481 km (including adjacent islands such as the Riau Islands and Bangka Belitung Islands).  - Brackish water or briny water is water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root \\"brak\\". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms).  - A Muslim is someone who follows or practises Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\\"sunnah \\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\\"hadith\\"). \\"Muslim\\" is an Arabic word meaning \\"one who submits (to God)\\".  - Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, refers to the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms produce much of the oxygen we breathe. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.  - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Bitung is a city on the northern coast of the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia . It is in the province of North Sulawesi , and faces Lembeh Island and the Lembeh Strait , which is known for its colorful marine life , in particular sea slugs . Bitung has a population of 187,932 at the 2010 Census .  - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - Manado (pronounced in Manado Malay, in Indonesian)) is the capital city of the North Sulawesi province of Indonesia. Manado is located at the Bay of Manado, and is surrounded by a mountainous area. The city had 408,354 inhabitants at the 2010 Census, making it the second-largest city in Sulawesi after Makassar. The latest official estimate (for January 2014) is 430,790.  - Sulawesi, formerly known as Celebes (or ), is an island in Indonesia. One of the four Greater Sunda Islands, and the world's eleventh-largest island, it is situated between Borneo and the Maluku Islands. Within Indonesia, only Sumatra, Borneo and Papua are larger in territory, and only Java and Sumatra have larger populations.  - The Maluku Islands or the Moluccas are an archipelago within Indonesia. Tectonically they are located on the Halmahera Plate within the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. Geographically they are located east of Sulawesi, west of New Guinea, and north and east of Timor. The islands were also the historical core of the Spice Islands known to the Chinese and Europeans, but this term usually included other adjacent areas such as Sulawesi. The name was due to the nutmeg, mace and cloves that were originally exclusively found there, and the presence of these sparked colonial interest from Europe in the 16th century.  - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.  - North Sulawesi is a province of Indonesia. It is located on the northern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi, on the Minahasa Peninsula lies south of Philippines and southeast of Malaysia. The province's capital and largest city is Manado, and its population was 2,270,596 according to the 2010 census; the latest official estimate (for January 2014) is 2,382,941.  - Malaysia is a federal constitutional monarchy located in Southeast Asia. It consists of thirteen states and three federal territories and has a total landmass of separated by the South China Sea into two similarly sized regions, Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand and maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. The capital city is Kuala Lumpur, while Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government. With a population of over 30 million, Malaysia is the 44th most populous country. The southernmost point of continental Eurasia, Tanjung Piai, is in Malaysia. Located in the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries on earth, with large numbers of endemic species.  - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.

The body is ovoid and compressed , and its streamlined body makes it a fast swimmer .","output":"While both sentences share certain similarities in describing the body shape and the fast swimming capabilities of an aquatic organism, there are differences in the precise description of the body shape. To break down each sentence: 1. The body is oily and compressed, and its streamlined body makes it a fast swimmer. In this sentence, the body shape is described as \\"oily and compressed.\\" The term oily indicates that the surface of the creature's body is slick or slippery, most likely to minimize water resistance or to make it difficult for predators to grasp it. The term \\"compressed\\" suggests that the body is flattened, which is also beneficial for reducing resistance when moving through the water. These factors, combined with the streamlined body shape, contribute to the organism's ability to swim quickly. A streamlined body shape means that the head, body, and tail are well-aligned and taper towards the rear, creating an efficient and hydrodynamic silhouette to reduce drag while swimming. 2. The body is ovoid and compressed, and its streamlined body makes it a fast swimmer. This sentence describes the body shape as \\"ovoid and compressed.\\" The term \\"ovoid\\" refers to an oval or egg-like shape, meaning that the creature's body has a rounded and elongated form. Similar to the first sentence, the term \\"compressed\\" suggests that the body is flattened, which helps to reduce water resistance when moving through the water. The streamlined body aspect is the same as the first sentence, meaning that the head, body, and tail are well-aligned and taper towards the rear, creating an efficient and hydrodynamic silhouette that reduces drag while swimming. In conclusion, while both sentences describe a compressed, streamlined body that makes the organism a fast swimmer, the difference between them lies in the additional characteristic of the body shape. In the first sentence, the body is described as \\"oily,\\" while in the second sentence, the body shape is described as \\"ovoid.\\" These differences indicate that the organisms being described, while sharing some common characteristics, have subtle differences in body shape and may not refer to the exact same creature or species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Look on the internet or at the library for information about your fish options. Take notes about the ones that seem particularly interesting to you.","output":"Consider their compatibility with other fish, how big they will grow, their eating habits, water temperature preferences, and any special care they will require. By doing this, you can create a list of fish that will thrive together in your aquarium. Prepare the tank. Before you introduce your fish, it's essential to set up a suitable environment for them. Depending on the size and number of fish you've chosen, select an appropriate aquarium. Make sure it's placed on a sturdy and level surface, away from direct sunlight, and close to electrical outlets for aquarium equipment. Once you have positioned the tank, gently rinse it with warm water and wipe it clean; avoid using soap or chemical cleaners, as they can be harmful to fish. Equip your aquarium. Fill the tank with a layer of substrate, such as gravel or sand, that's about 2 inches deep. This allows the fish a place to interact, as well as providing a home for helpful bacteria. Next, add artificial plants or decorations, which serve as hiding spots for the fish, and real plants, which provide oxygen and a natural habitat. Make sure you have a heater and thermometer to maintain a stable temperature, and a filter to keep the water clean and clear. Cycle the tank. Before adding any live fish, make sure your tank is cycled. This process involves nurturing beneficial bacteria, which convert harmful ammonia and nitrite in the fish’s waste into less harmful nitrate. Cycling the tank typically takes 2-4 weeks and can be done by adding ammonia directly to the tank or by placing a piece of raw fish or shrimp inside. Regularly test the water to ensure ammonia levels decrease and nitrite levels rise, followed by a drop in nitrite as nitrate appears. Once these readings stabilize, the tank is safe for fish to be added. Slowly introduce your fish. Start by adding a few fish at a time to avoid overloading the tank's filtration system. Gently float the fish in a bag, sealed with air, on the surface of the tank for 15-20 minutes to equalize the temperature. Then, open the bag and slowly introduce tank water into the bag to adjust the fish to the tank's chemistry. Release the fish into your aquarium and keep an eye on their behavior to ensure they are settling in well. Feed your fish the right way. Learn the dietary preferences of your chosen fish species, as some may prefer flakes, while others require live or frozen foods. Feed them small amounts twice a day, enough that they can eat within 3-5 minutes. Be careful not to overfeed, as excess food will decompose and pollute the water, leading to health issues for your fish. Regularly maintain the tank. Monitor water parameters, such as pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate, with testing kits, and ensure the water temperature remains stable. Conduct partial water changes of 20-30% every two to four weeks, depending on the stocking density of the tank. Clean any algae buildup using an aquarium-safe sponge or scraper, and rinse filter media with aquarium water to preserve beneficial bacteria. In conclusion, taking care of freshwater fish involves research, preparing a suitable environment, and monitoring your fish’s health and habitat. By committing to these steps, you will be well on your way to creating a vibrant and thriving freshwater aquarium that you and your fish will enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: WHO CONDUCTS ORCHESTRA FOR HIS FORMER STUDENTS? Movie plot title: Mr. Holland's Opus Movie plot: In 1965, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a professional musician and composer who has been relatively successful in the exhausting life of a musician. However, in an attempt to enjoy more free time with his young wife, Iris (Glenne Headly), and to enable him to compose a piece of orchestral music, the 30-year-old Holland accepts a high school teaching position. Unfortunately for Holland, he is soon forced to realize that his position as a music teacher makes him a marginalized figure in the faculty's hierarchy. Many of his colleagues, and some in the school's administration, including the school's principal (Olympia Dukakis) and vice principal (William H. Macy), resent Holland and question the value and importance of music education given the school's strained budget. However, he quickly begins to win many of his colleagues over. In the classroom, Holland finds success utilizing rock and roll as a way to make classical music more accessible to his students. Gradually, stubbornly, he begins to see his students as individuals and begins finding ways to help them excel. When Iris becomes pregnant, Holland uses the money saved up to produce his orchestration in order to buy a house. Their son Cole is born during the summer following his first year as a teacher. When school resumes, Holland is put in charge of the school marching band. The school's football coach Bill (Jay Thomas) helps him in exchange for allowing an academically challenged football player/wrestler named Louis Russ (Terrence Howard) to play the drums for academic credit so he can keep his spot on the wrestling team. At home, Holland's lack of quality time with his wife creates tension. When their son Cole is diagnosed as deaf, Holland reacts with hostility to the news that he can never teach the joys of music to his own child. His wife willingly learns American Sign Language to communicate with their son.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: what is the age of criminal responsibility in nsw?","output":"The age of criminal responsibility in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, is set at 10 years old. This means that children under the age of 10 cannot be held legally responsible for their actions or charged with criminal offenses. This rule is consistent with the age of criminal responsibility set throughout Australia, as all Australian states and territories adhere to the same standard as established under the common law. There is, however, an additional principle called doli incapax, which operates between the ages of 10 and 14 years old. Under this principle, children aged between 10 and 14 years can only be held criminally responsible if it can be proven that they had the capacity to understand that their actions were seriously wrong, rather than just mischievous or naughty. Prosecutors face the burden of proof to demonstrate that the child had sufficient understanding and knowledge of their actions being wrong at the time of the offense. The age of criminal responsibility in NSW and Australia has drawn much criticism from various organizations such as the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. They argue that the age of 10 does not take into account the cognitive development and emotional maturity of children, and recommend raising the age of criminal responsibility to at least 12 or 14 years old. These concerns derive from research showing that holding younger children accountable for their actions within the criminal justice system may result in detrimental effects on their mental health, social development, and likelihood of recidivism. With these concerns in mind, there has been increasing pressure on the Australian government to review and potentially raise the age of criminal responsibility. Some arguments in favor of raising the age include aligning Australia with international standards, as countries like Canada and Germany have set the age of criminal responsibility at 12 years, while in several European countries, it is set at 14 or higher. Child rights advocates also emphasize the importance of addressing the underlying social issues that often lead to juvenile delinquency. They recommend focusing on early intervention, support, and rehabilitation programs that target the root causes of offending behaviors, rather than subjecting young children to the potential negative impacts of the criminal justice system. In summary, the age of criminal responsibility in NSW is set at 10 years old, but the principle of doli incapax provides some measure of protection for children between the ages of 10 and 14. Despite these provisions, there is ongoing debate about whether the age should be raised to better align with the cognitive development and emotional maturity of children, as well as international standards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some also include the most southern and eastern parts of Lazio (Sora, Cassino, Gaeta, Cittaducale and Amatrice districts) within the \\"Mezzogiorno\\", because these territories were also part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The island of Sardinia, although for cultural and historical reasons having less in common with the aforementioned regions, is frequently included as Southern Italy or \\"Mezzogiorno\\", often for statistical and economical purposes.  - The Italian Wars, often referred to as the Great Italian Wars or the Great Wars of Italy and sometimes as the HabsburgValois Wars or the Renaissance Wars, were a series of conflicts from 1494 to 1559 that involved, at various times, most of the city-states of Italy, the Papal States, the Republic of Venice, most of the major states of Western Europe (France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, and Scotland) as well as the Ottoman Empire.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.

Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery. Stuart returns to the strip club and taunts Leo, leading to a fight and Maksim firing Leo. When he's unable to contact Naadirah, Leo asks Luba for help, but Luba refuses.

Electric motorcycles used as stealth crime-fighting tool Electric vehicles are often touted for their energy efficiency, but some California police officers see another attribute: stealth crime-fighting tool.

The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos is a producer and writer for HBO's New Orleans-set, \\"Treme.\\" He was previously a producer and Emmy-nominated writer on the hit series \\"The Wire\\" and the miniseries \\"The Pacific.\\" Read an excerpt from \\"The Cut\\" CNN recently spoke to Pelecanos about his new novel.

I’m dorky and like to use little proverbs all the time. One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Where is the best place to bathe a guinea pig?","output":"When deciding the best place to bathe your guinea pig, it is essential to carefully consider their safety, comfort, and well-being. There are two primary options that are commonly considered for this process: using a sink or a shallow basin. Both solutions have their pros and cons, but a thorough analysis of the factors involved can help determine the optimal choice. 1. Using a sink: Advantages: - Accessibility: A sink may be a more accessible option for many guinea pig owners, as it is usually available in most households and can be easily adapted for the task. - Height: The height of the sink may make it more comfortable for the owner and reduce the need to bend over, which reduces strain on the back. - Water control: A sink provides easy-to-reach access to water, making it simple to control the water pressure and temperature, ensuring that the water is warm but not hot to avoid thermal shock to your guinea pig. - Drainage: It is easier to clean up and drain the water away when using a sink. Disadvantages: - Risk of falling: The risk of a guinea pig falling or jumping out of an elevated sink and getting injured is higher. - Limited space: A sink usually has a smaller space that may make it difficult for the guinea pig to feel comfortable and relaxed, increasing stress levels. - Slippery surface: The surface of a sink is often slippery, which may make the guinea pig panic or skid around in the wet environment, leading to stress and potential injury. 2. Using a shallow basin: Advantages: - Safe environment: With a basin placed on a flat surface like a countertop or floor, the risk of your guinea pig falling or jumping from a height is significantly reduced. - More space: A basin typically provides more space for your guinea pig to move around, making it more comfortable and less stressful. - Control over environment: A basin allows you to create a shallow pool of water that you can gently pour or ladle over your guinea pig, ensuring better control over water temperature and pressure. - Reduced stress: Since guinea pigs are prey animals, they may feel more secure being closer to the ground. The added predictability of the environment in a basin can help reduce stress levels. Disadvantages: - Bending over: Depending on the chosen location for the basin, you might have to bend over for an extended period, which might cause discomfort for the owner. - Water accessibility: You may need to prepare and transport the water separately, which might add a little more complexity to the process. - Cleanup: Cleaning up after bathing might be a bit more tedious, as you'll need to deal with excess water and the basin itself. Overall, choosing the best place to bathe your guinea pig depends on the specific needs and preferences of both the owner and the pet. In general, a shallow basin is a better choice for guinea pig safety and comfort. The reduced risk of falls, ample space, and ability to create a more controlled and predictable environment allows guinea pigs to feel more secure and relaxed, while making the process easier for owners. However, it is always essential to proceed with caution and take the appropriate steps to ensure a safe and positive experience for both you and your guinea pig, no matter the chosen location."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Baltimore responded with a 22-yard touchdown run from running back Ray Rice, yet Longwell helped out Minnesota by nailing a 22-yard field goal. Afterwards, an action-packed fourth quarter ensued. Minnesota increased its lead with Favre hooking up with Shiancoe again on a 1-yard touchdown pass, but the Ravens continued to hang around as quarterback Joe Flacco found wide receiver Mark Clayton on a 32-yard touchdown pass. The Vikings replied with Longwell's 29-yard field goal, but Baltimore took lead for the first time in the game as Flacco hooked up with wide receiver Derrick Mason on a 12-yard touchdown pass and Rice running 33 yards for a touchdown. Minnesota then regained the lead as Longwell booted a 31-yard field goal after a 58-yard pass from quarterback Brett Favre to wide receiver Sidney Rice. The Ravens got a last-minute drive into scoring range, but Hauschka's 44-yard field goal attempt went wide left, preserving the Vikings' perfect season.

And the answer is?","output":"Mr. Darcy's first name in the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen is Fitzwilliam. Fitzwilliam Darcy is a central character in the story and is considered one of the most iconic romantic heroes in English literature. The novel, which was published in 1813, tells the story of the spirited and intelligent Elizabeth Bennet, who faces societal pressures to marry suitable gentlemen for their social standing. Fitzwilliam Darcy is a wealthy, young, and reserved man who initially appears aloof and proud. This causes Elizabeth and the other characters in the novel to form a negative opinion of him. As the novel progresses, however, Darcy's true nature is slowly revealed, and he and Elizabeth gradually become acquainted. Eventually, their mutual understanding and respect for each other form the basis of a deep and loving connection between them. Fitzwilliam Darcy's character is primarily defined by his genuine integrity, loyalty, and sense of honor, as well as his deep love for Elizabeth Bennet. As their relationship develops, he demonstrates considerable growth and self-awareness, striving to overcome his prejudices and become a more considerate and emotionally open man. Elizabeth's affection towards Darcy also evolves over time. At first, she sees him as arrogant and condescending and refuses his initial marriage proposal. As she learns more about his true character and good deeds, her opinion of him changes, and she becomes open to the idea of marrying him. Additionally, Darcy's considerable wealth and social status play a significant role in shaping his character and influencing his actions throughout the novel. As the owner of the grand Pemberley estate in Derbyshire, he has a responsibility towards his family, tenants, and servants. This shapes him into a responsible, reliable, and dutiful individual. At the same time, his privileged upbringing and position in society contribute to some of his initial missteps and misunderstandings with Elizabeth and her family. In conclusion, Fitzwilliam Darcy is a multi-dimensional and unforgettable character in Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" His romance with Elizabeth Bennet, their mutual growth, and evolving understanding of each other's character are essential aspects of the novel's enduring appeal and success. Darcy's transformation from apparent arrogance to humility and self-awareness makes him a fascinating, endearing figure in English literature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: who was quarterback for the panthers?","output":"Title: A Story About the Quarterback for the Panthers Once upon a time in a land called the United States, there lived a football team named the Carolina Panthers. Now, when we talk about football, we don't mean soccer. Instead, we mean a game where players throw and catch a ball and try to run it into the other team's area, called the end zone. Football teams are made up of many players who have different jobs. One very important job is the quarterback. The quarterback is like the captain of the ship. He's the player who leads his team on the field, makes decisions, and throws the ball to other players. Over the years, there have been different people who played as the quarterback for the Panthers. We are going to tell you about some of them. From 2011 to 2019, a man named Cam Newton was the quarterback for the Panthers. He was a very tall and strong guy who could throw the ball far and run fast! Did you know he even won a special award called the MVP in 2015? MVP stands for \\"Most Valuable Player,\\" which means he was considered the best player in the whole league that year! Before Cam Newton, there was a man named Jake Delhomme. From 2003 to 2009, Jake led the Panthers as their quarterback. He was a really good leader, and he even helped the Panthers make it to a super special game called the Super Bowl in 2004! The Super Bowl is the biggest game in football, where the best teams from each side of the country come together and play to see who is the best of the best. After Cam Newton left the team in 2019, another man named Teddy Bridgewater became the Panthers' quarterback for a short time in the 2020 season. Teddy had a lot of experience. He played football in college and was a quarterback for other teams like the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints before coming to the Panthers. These are just a few of the people who have played the role of quarterback for the Carolina Panthers. They each had different strengths and helped their team win many games. Quarterbacks are super important in football, and they make the game exciting and fun to watch! So the next time you hear someone talking about the Panthers' quarterback, remember the story of these amazing players and how they led their team on the field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: \\"Hey, guy.\\" \\"No, this is Ray.\\" He smiled, leaned back in his chair. It was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly. Pete's vocabulary did not include the word shithead either in its singular or plural. \\"Pete, they're all like that. Alcohol is bad medicine. That's why places like ours are in business.

Steven Noel Wariner was born on Christmas Day of 1954 in Noblesville, Indiana. Influenced at an early age by George Jones and Chet Atkins, Wariner started performing in his father's band, and later moved on to playing in local clubs. By age 17, he had been hired by Dottie West as a bass guitarist, and played on her single \\"Country Sunshine\\". He also worked with Glen Campbell, who he has cited as a major influence on his work. 1991 saw the release of Wariner's first album for Arista Records. Entitled I Am Ready, this was also the first album of his career to be certified gold for shipping 500,000 copies in the United States. Singles from it included \\"Leave Him Out of This\\", \\"The Tips of My Fingers\\" (a cover of Bill Anderson's 1960 single), \\"A Woman Loves\\", \\"Crash Course in the Blues\\" and \\"Like a River to the Sea\\". These first three singles were all Top 10 hits. In 1992, Wariner received his first Grammy Award, for Best Country Vocal Collaboration, as a guest vocalist and guitarist alongside Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs and fiddler Mark O'Connor on the single \\"Restless\\", a No. 25-peaking single from O'Connor's album The New Nashville Cats. He also collaborated with O'Connor on the No. 71-peaking \\"Now It Belongs to You\\" on the same album.  His second album for Arista was 1993's Drive. Leading off this album was the Top 10 \\"If I Didn't Love You\\". After it came the Top 30 hits \\"Drivin' and Cryin'\\" and \\"It Won't Be Over You\\", although the album's title track stopped at No. 63. Wariner, along with Lee Roy Parnell and Diamond Rio, recorded a cover of Merle Haggard's \\"Workin' Man's Blues\\" as the fictional band Jed Zeppelin for the late-1994 tribute album Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard. This cover peaked at No. 48 and was made into a music video. A year later, Wariner contributed a cover of the song \\"Get Back\\" to Come Together: America Salutes The Beatles, a tribute album which included country music covers of songs by The Beatles. His rendition charted at No. 72 on the country charts and was also a music video shot primarily at Union Station in Nashville.  An instrumental album, No More Mr. Nice Guy followed in 1996. His final Arista release, it produced no singles, although one of the tracks, \\"Brickyard Boogie\\", was nominated for Best Country Instrumental at the 1997 Grammy Awards. This track was a collaboration with Bryan White, Jeffrey Steele, Bryan Austin and former Pearl River guitarist Derek George. Despite exiting Arista in 1997, Wariner made a guest appearance along with Mac McAnally in the music video for Sawyer Brown's 1997 single \\"This Night Won't Last Forever\\", a cover of the Michael Johnson song. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he wok with any other artist?","output":"Yes, he worked with several other artists.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 28*h - 27 = 57 for h.","output":"To solve for h, we can follow these steps: Step 1: The problem is expressed in the form ax - b = c, where a is 28 (representing the coefficient of h), b is 27, and c is 57. So, our first equation is: 28h - 27 = 57 Step 2: To isolate h, we need to get rid of the \\"-27\\" on the left side of the equation.  We can do this by adding 27 to both sides of the equation. The principle here is that what you do to one side of an equation, you must also do to the other side in order to preserve equality: 28h - 27 + 27 = 57 + 27 which simplifies to: 28h = 84 Step 3: Now, to completely isolate h, we need to get rid of the \\"28\\" that's multiplying h.  We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 28: 28h / 28 = 84 / 28 which simplifies to: h = 3 So, the solution to the equation 28h - 27 = 57 is h = 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's essential to examine the context in which this occurred, as well as the possible reasons for this disparity in knowledge. 1. Access to information: One potential reason for the imbalance of knowledge could be that the person had more access to information compared to others. This might imply that they are better informed because of their position, background, or connections with others who have had more access to the situation or the involved people. 2. Experience: Oftentimes, individuals with more experience in a particular field or life in general, have a better understanding of various situations. Their past experiences can help them predict future outcomes or understand a situation more effectively. 3. Observational Skills: The ability to observe and decipher information from one's surroundings is a valuable skill. Some individuals have a better grasp of these analytical skills, meaning they may observe and comprehend a situation more accurately than others. 4. Sharing information: In some cases, the person with additional knowledge might not have shared this information with others. This could have been deliberate if they felt that sharing it would put them at a disadvantage or unintentional due to a lack of communication or misunderstanding. 5. Perception and interpretation: Each person perceives and interprets a situation from their perspective. It's possible that another individual understood the situation differently due to their unique perspective and life experiences, while others couldn't grasp the broader context or implications. To address the fact that someone else had better knowledge or understanding of a situation, you can: 1. Seek clarification: Ask the person to provide more information or explain their perspective in greater detail. This learning opportunity can improve your understanding of the situation and help prevent such instances in the future. 2. Encourage open communication: Promote a culture of open communication and information sharing among your group to ensure that everyone stays informed and aware of relevant developments. 3. Invest in personal development: Work on improving your observational, analytical, and problem-solving skills to better understand future situations. 4. Leverage the strengths of others: Recognize that each person brings their unique skills and perspectives. Collaborate and learn from one another for the best possible results. In summary, the fact that someone knew more about a situation than others can be attributed to various factors such as access to information, experience, observational skills, sharing of information, or differences in perception and interpretation. Addressing this disparity involves asking questions, promoting communication, refining your skills, and leveraging the strengths of others."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

What is the answer for the question: What location is next to Russian Hill and North Beach? from the following article ?  The historic center of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by Market Street and the waterfront. It is here that the Financial District is centered, with Union Square, the principal shopping and hotel district, and the Tenderloin nearby. Cable cars carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill, once the home of the city's business tycoons, and down to the waterfront tourist attractions of Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39, where many restaurants feature Dungeness crab from a still-active fishing industry. Also in this quadrant are Russian Hill, a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked Lombard Street; North Beach, the city's Little Italy and the former center of the Beat Generation; and Telegraph Hill, which features Coit Tower. Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San Francisco's Chinatown, the oldest Chinatown in North America. The South of Market, which was once San Francisco's industrial core, has seen significant redevelopment following the construction of AT&T Park and an infusion of startup companies. New skyscrapers, live-work lofts, and condominiums dot the area. Further development is taking place just to the south in Mission Bay area, a former railroad yard, which now has a second campus of the University of California, San Francisco, and where the new Warriors arena will be built.West of downtown, across Van Ness Avenue, lies the large Western Addition neighborhood, which became established with a large African American population after World War II. The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including Hayes Valley, the Fillmore, and Japantown, which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its Japanese American residents were forcibly removed and interned during World War II.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more rocks available happens, how will it affect more cocoon hatches.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The supposed perturbation of having more rocks available does not have a direct effect on the process of a caterpillar's metamorphosis into a butterfly. The primary factors in this process are the caterpillar's growth, food availability, and environment for cocoon formation. However, there could be an indirect effect if these rocks provide additional suitable locations for caterpillars to form their cocoons, potentially increasing the number of successful hatches. This indirect effect would depend on the specific environment and the way in which the rocks enhance the caterpillars' habitat, such as offering protection from predators or more stable resting places."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Know that you will not be sleeping in your comfortable bed. Recognize that your situation is probably going to cause some inconveniences for you and will not be what you are used to. Be ok with it, though, and enjoy your new experience while it lasts. Take this opportunity to look at the twinkling stars, smell the clean air and listen to the sounds of the wilderness. Temperatures can drop quickly after sunset and things can get very dark. Be prepared by keeping layers of clothing and other forms of insulation as well as flashlights or a headlamp in your car and on your person if you are hiking or camping. For safety, a whistle, knife or other tool can also be useful. Be prepared for nighttime bathroom breaks. Put a flashlight or headlamp near you, along with your shoes. Secure all your food and anything scented outside your tent, if you have one, or away from your sleeping location. If you spill some of your food, collect it and put it in approved bins. Do not spit out toothpaste near where you will sleep either. If your clothes have collected the scent of food or food residue, do not wear them to sleep. Even though you will be sleeping on the ground, you can help your mind and body get ready for bed by doing the same things you would normally do before bed. If you usually brush your teeth before you get into bed, then do that before you lay down in your makeshift bed. It can give you a feeling of normalcy. A meal or snack before bed can help you go to sleep. If it's a cold night, digesting the food can warm you up. Your body will then generate more heat to keep you warmer. Eat foods that contain the sleep hormone melatonin, such as tart cherries or walnuts. Some light exercise can help make you tired. Stretching can be relaxing or you can do some sit-ups or pushups. Don't exercise too intensely, though, or you could become more awake. You also don't want to get sweaty. Always make sure you have adequate water access. Being thirsty is not conducive to sleep. You don't want to drink so much that you have to pee all night, but you do want to be hydrated. This will aid blood circulation and help get rid of the possibility of headaches, like those that can happen at high altitudes. A warm beverage can be soothing and help you keep warm. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages, though, if it is cold. They can actually increase heat loss because consuming alcohol tends to dilate blood vessels under the skin. Read or take deep breaths to calm your body and mind down. If the night sounds spook you, then try not to listen too much to them. Most animals are not dangerous and are probably more scared of people than you are of them.  Try sleeping near a river (keep a safe distance). The sound of rushing water can serve as white noise that drowns out unnerving night sounds. Eventually, you will be tired enough to fall asleep. It can be rough at first but if you are sleeping on the ground for more than a night or 2, it will start to get very easy. Being as comfortable as possible is the most helpful thing you can do to fall asleep on the ground. Summary:","output":"Embrace the inconveniences of sleeping outdoors by preparing with layers, insulation, and safety tools, maintaining nighttime routines, choosing the right food and exercise, staying hydrated, and finding relaxation methods like white noise to make it easier to fall asleep on the ground."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jerusalem (CNN) -- Aid intended for Gaza that was unloaded from a Libyan-backed ship in northern Egypt was sitting in storage Saturday, awaiting transfer, according to the governor of North Sinai. The ship from the Gadhafi foundation, a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, docked in Al Arish and began unloading aid Thursday. However, it was taking time to sort out the medical supplies -- a top priority for delivery -- from other aid, Gen. Morad Mowafe told CNN Saturday. Mowafe expected that the aid would arrive in Gaza by Sunday. The ship reached Egypt after sailing from Greece on July 10 with 2,000 tons of aid. It was the latest ship attempting to breach an Israeli naval blockade of the Palestinian territory of Gaza whose captain was persuaded to dock elsewhere instead.

And I was wondering What will happen to Alex?","output":"In order to determine what may happen to Alex after receiving a subpoena from the government, I will go through the following steps: Step 1: Identify the purpose of the subpoena I will first need to figure out the context or reason behind the subpoena. Subpoenas are legal documents that require the recipient to produce documents, provide testimony, or both, in a legal proceeding. The government may have an investigation or ongoing case in which Alex's information is important. Step 2: Assess Alex's involvement in the case It's essential to understand Alex's role in the legal matter. Alex could be a witness, a person of interest, or even a suspect, depending on the situation. This will determine the potential consequences Alex may face. Step 3: Consider Alex's potential cooperation We must consider if Alex is willing to cooperate with the government's request, as this will have a significant impact on the outcome. If Alex complies, they might avoid any negative consequences and help the investigation. If they refuse to comply, they may face legal penalties or be seen as uncooperative by the court. Step 4: Evaluate possible outcomes Depending on the purpose of the subpoena and Alex's involvement, there are several possible outcomes for Alex: a) If Alex is a witness: They will provide testimony or documents, which may help the investigation, and no negative consequences will likely arise from their involvement. b) If Alex is a person of interest or suspect: Their outcome will vary depending on their cooperation and whether they are found guilty of any crimes. If found guilty, they may face legal penalties like fines, probation, or imprisonment. In conclusion, to determine what may happen to Alex after receiving a government subpoena, I need to assess the context behind the subpoena, understand Alex's involvement, and consider the degree to which they cooperate. Each of these factors will play a crucial role in determining the potential outcomes for Alex in their legal situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.

In 1848, James W. Marshall found gold in California and people began having golden dreams. That 19th century \\"American Dream\\" motivated   the Gold Rush and gave California its nickname of the \\"Golden State\\". The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next. People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets. But most, instead, worked as railroad labourers. They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \\"the old gold hill\\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare. Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley. People poured their energy into the Internet. This new chapter of the American Dream attracted many business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups and seek fortunes in America. Better pay, a nice house, and a rising standard of living will always be attractive. However, the new American Dream is no longer just about money. It encourages Americans to consume wisely to protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and promote social justice. The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become the model of the new American Dream. After years of hard work, he grew from a poor young man from Austria into a movie superstar and then governor. Many people hope his story can save the American Dream and give California a brighter future. Options: A Because they could earn more money as railroad laborers.

Washington (CNN) -- A new incident inflaming tensions between the United States and Afghanistan -- this time the alleged massacre of 16 Afghan civilians by a U.S. soldier -- calls into question the chances for stability as the U.S.-led military mission shifts security responsibility to Afghan forces in coming months. Sunday's shootings in Kandahar province followed a series of events that already had sparked anger and distrust between the Afghan and U.S. governments, including the burning of Qurans by U.S. soldiers that led to a violent backlash, including attacks that killed U.S. service members. Now the concern is that an atrocity apparently carried out by a lone American soldier will heighten anti-U.S. sentiments among a civilian population that is key to a successful counterinsurgency strategy against the Taliban.

Other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - Afghan, American, CNN, Qurans, Taliban, U.S., United States, and Washington: These are not locations where the Taliban would issue their statement. The statement needs to be in response to an incident that happened in Afghanistan, which is why \\"Afghanistan on Monday\\" is the correct choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the most sensical answer between \\"Siren far\\" and  \\"Siren near\\"?","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"Siren far\\" and \\"Siren near\\" would be \\"Siren far.\\" When the police siren leaves the area and gets further away, its sound typically becomes quieter due to the Doppler effect and the decrease in sound intensity as the distance between the source of sound and the observer increases.  The Doppler effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a wave source (like the police siren) is either moving closer to or away from an observer, causing the perceived frequency of the wave to either increase or decrease respectively. In the case of a siren moving away from the observer, the frequency of the sound wave decreases, and this is perceived as a decrease in pitch or loudness. In addition to the Doppler effect, the decrease in loudness can also be explained by the inverse square law. This law states that the intensity of sound decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from the source. Essentially, as the distance between the siren and the person listening increases, the sound intensity decreases, and the siren becomes quieter. Consequently, when the police siren gets further away, it becomes quieter, and this is consistent with the description in the short story. The answer \\"Siren far\\" would be the most accurate choice, as it represents the situation where the siren moves away and becomes less audible to the observer. Conversely, \\"Siren near\\" would represent a scenario where the siren moves closer to the observer, which is not supported by the story's description.

Step 2: Analyze the options We have to think about the habitat of each listed animal and consider if it could be replaced by a housing development. Most of these animals like humans, bullfrogs, frogs, raccoons, pigeons, opossum, and deer live in terrestrial environments that would likely be affected by a housing development.  However, based on the additional provided information, salmon habitat includes freshwater, estuarine, and marine environments, which are less likely to be replaced by housing development as humans typically don't build housing in these environments. Step 3: Select the best answer Based on the discussion above, the \\"salmon\\" would be the best answer since salmon's habitat is least likely to be covered over by a housing development.

Follow your nose and you'll find yourself in Eastern China by way of Uncle Paul's Kitchen. That's the name Water & Wall chef Tim Ma has given the restaurant's pop-up lunch menu. It's a tribute to his uncle, Paul Ma, a master of Shandong-style Chinese cooking since his years of running a small grocery and restaurant in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. Kung pao pork belly at Water & Wall's lunch pop-up. (Rey Lopez) Shandong cooking favors fish and pork, stir-fried at extremely high temperatures. The resulting dishes are light and crispy, rather than bathed in oily sauces. At Water & Wall, Ma puts his own spin on Uncle Paul's Shandong classics, with dishes such as kung pao pork belly (pictured) with scallions and celery; lobster Rangoon with cream cheese and in a wonton wrapper; and a beef and broccoli dish prepared from cuts of brisket. Dishes are 6-10 each. The pop-up menu is available Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. through Aug. 30. The full menu is available here.

When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.

This right is enshrined in the Bill of Rights, which consists of the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The Second Amendment reads: \\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The intent and interpretation of the Second Amendment have been the subject of much debate since its ratification. Regardless of these debates, the right to bear arms is considered a fundamental right in the United States. The origins of the Second Amendment can be traced back to the various English legal traditions and rights of English subjects, especially the right to have arms for self-defense. The right to bear arms was also influenced by the historical experience of the American colonists, who viewed the right to possess firearms as a crucial component of their individual and collective security. During the Revolutionary War, American colonists relied heavily on militias, which were made up of citizens who owned their firearms, as opposed to a standing army. Many of the founding fathers believed that the preservation of a well-regulated militia was essential to maintain the hard-won freedoms from British rule and to prevent the rise of tyranny in their young nation. In the years leading up to the adoption of the Second Amendment, several state constitutions already contained language expressing the right to bear arms. The Second Amendment was proposed by James Madison as part of a broader package of amendments that sought to address the concerns of Anti-Federalists who were worried about the potential for the new central government to infringe upon individual liberties and states' rights. The exact meaning and scope of the Second Amendment have been the subject of ongoing legal and political debates. Some people claim that the amendment is focused on protecting individual rights to own firearms, while others argue that it is centered on the rights and responsibilities of state militias. In the landmark case D.C. v. Heller (2008), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess firearms for self-defense, unconnected to service in a militia. However, the court also noted that the right to bear arms is not unlimited, and the government can impose regulations on firearms in certain situations. In summary, the right to bear arms was passed with the ratification of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 15, 1791, and it is rooted in the historical experience, legal traditions, and beliefs of the founding fathers. The scope and interpretation of the Second Amendment continue to be the subject of political and legal debate in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From atop a pillar, a statue of King Bhupatindra Malla, who embellished the square in the 18th century, looks down onto the glorious Sun Dhoka, the Golden Gate, which serves as entrance to the palace. Does it follow that \\"The statue of King Bhupatindra Malla is buried in a tomb\\"?","output":"The statement \\"The statue of King Bhupatindra Malla is buried in a tomb\\" does not follow from the given information about the statue and its location. The information provided earlier states that the statue of King Bhupatindra Malla stands atop a pillar, overlooking the Sun Dhoka or the Golden Gate, which is the entrance to the palace. This clearly implies that the statue is in an elevated position and visible to the public. A tomb typically refers to a burial site or a place where a deceased person is interred. It usually provides a space for the remains of a person or multiple individuals and is often accompanied by different forms of memorialization, such as monuments, statues, or inscriptions that pay tribute to the dead. Tombs can be found in various forms, from underground chambers to elaborate mausoleums, and are generally reserved for significant individuals, like nobility or royalty. In the case of King Bhupatindra Malla's statue, there is a significant difference between a tomb and its current location on a pillar in a public space. The statue is not buried or interred in a tomb; instead, it stands prominently to honor the king's memory and his contributions to the architectural development of the square in the 18th century. Moreover, the erecting of a statue of King Bhupatindra Malla on a pillar serves a different function than a tomb. For one, it is a public display of commemoration that highlights the king's influence during his reign, rather than a solemn place designated specifically for mourning the passing of the individual. The statue's placement above the Sun Dhoka suggests that it symbolizes a gatekeeper role, guarding the entrance to the palace and evoking the strength and authority of the king it represents. In conclusion, given the positioning of the statue on a pillar in a public setting, and considering its prominent visual location above the Sun Dhoka, we can deduce that the statue of King Bhupatindra Malla is not buried in a tomb. Rather, it remains an enduring symbol of the king's historical impact and legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation. The term of internal representation implies that such definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007). The latter component is also called engram or memory traces (Semon 1904). Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought (Moscovitch 2007). What is the answer to this question: What suggests that memory has two different components?","output":"The article suggests that memory has two different components based on the cognitive neuroscientists' definition of memory and the concept of internal representation. Let's break down these components and understand their significance in the context of memory. 1. Expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level: This component relates to the way our memories manifest in our thoughts, actions, or behaviors. For instance, when we remember a past event and use that information to influence our current behavior, this represents the conscious expression of memory. This aspect of memory highlights how the stored information is made use of, either at the conscious behavioral level, or in our thoughts. 2. Underpinning physical neural changes (engram or memory traces): The second component refers to the physical and neurological basis of memory. Engram or memory traces are the lasting changes in the brain's neural structure that result from our experiences. These changes form the basis of our memories, allowing them to be stored and later retrieved when required. Engram is the portion of our brain circuitry that holds specific memories. Memory traces are responsible for encoding, storing, and retrieving this information, by maintaining the structural and functional connections between neurons. Cognitive neuroscientists emphasize these two components in their definition of memory because they recognize the importance of both the ways memory is expressed and the underlying neural processes that support it. The article also highlights a debate among neuroscientists and psychologists; some mistakenly equate the engram, or memory traces, with memory itself, which would be an oversimplification. Discussing memory as a two-component construct helps to distinguish between the physical storage (engram/memory traces) and the actual expression of memory in behavior or thought. It allows for a much more comprehensive understanding of how memories are formed, retained, accessed, and utilized. In conclusion, the cognitive neuroscientists' definition of memory, based on the internal representation concept, suggests that memory has two different components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (engram or memory traces)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Patriots began their regular season at home against the Chiefs. On the first drive of the game, a running-into-the-kicker penalty committed by the Chiefs on a fourth-down punt gave the Patriots a fresh set of downs, but three plays later, wide receiver Wes Welker fumbled after catching a pass from quarterback Tom Brady. The Chiefs recovered and started their next drive at their own 48-yard line but failed to convert on third down and punted. On the ensuing Patriots possession, the Chiefs again recovered a fumble by a Patriots receiver after a catch; this time wide receiver Randy Moss lost the ball after a 28-yard completion from Brady. After the throw, Brady was hit in his lower left leg by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard, left the game, did not return, and was later placed on injured reserve with a torn ACL and a torn MCL. Quarterback Matt Cassel replaced Brady for the Patriots' next drive, which began from the Patriots' 2-yard line. Seven plays after a 51-yard completion to Moss from inside the Patriots' 1, Cassel hit Moss in the end zone from 10 yards out for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter. The teams then exchanged three-and-outs twice, before the Chiefs ended a 13-play, 51-yard drive with a 40-yard Nick Novak field goal to cut the Patriots' lead to 7-3 at the end of the first half. After a Chiefs punt on a drive in which Chiefs quarterback Brodie Croyle was injured on a sack by Adalius Thomas, the Patriots drove 80 yards on 11 plays, capping off the series with a 5-yard touchdown run by running back Sammy Morris to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-3. The next Chiefs drive began with backup quarterback Damon Huard replacing Croyle. The Chiefs drove 63 yards and trimmed the Patriots' lead to 14-10 on a 13-yard touchdown reception by wide receiver Dwayne Bowe. After three punts, Huard and the Chiefs began a fourth-quarter drive by throwing an interception to Patriots cornerback Ellis Hobbs; a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on the Patriots caused their ensuing series to begin at their own 47-yard line. A handful of Morris runs and Cassel passes, including an 11-yard reception by Morris, brought the Patriots into the Chiefs' red zone, but the Patriots failed to convert on third down and settled for a 37-yard Stephen Gostkowski field goal to make their lead 17-10. Starting from his own 22-yard line with 2:20 remaining, Huard was strip-sacked on the third play of the series, but recovered his own fumble at the Chiefs' 27-yard line. On the next play, Huard hit wide receiver Devard Darling for a 68-yard completion, giving the Chiefs first-and-goal from the Patriots' 5-yard line with 53 seconds left. However, the Patriots' defense prevented the Chiefs from advancing another yard, as an incomplete pass, a Larry Johnson run for no gain, and two more incomplete passes gave the Patriots the ball back to seal their first victory of the season, and their 20th consecutive regular-season win. Answer this question: How many fumbles were their in the first quarter?","output":"In the first quarter, there were two fumbles. First, wide receiver Wes Welker fumbled after catching a pass from quarterback Tom Brady.

Write an article based on this summary: Wales fans will be heavily outnumbered in their Euro 2016 quarter-final with Belgium in Lille - with most French fans cheering for the opposition. Article:","output":"Title: Wales vs. Belgium Euro 2016 Quarter-Final: The Underdog Welsh Face Overwhelming Opposition in Lille In the Euro 2016 quarter-final set to take place between Wales and Belgium in Lille, a unique situation has materialized. Wales fans, who have already made their presence felt with their passionate support, will find themselves heavily outnumbered in Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Not only will they be facing thousands of Belgian fans making the short trip across the border, but they will also have to contend with most of the French fans in attendance, as they too appear to be in support of the Belgian side. The buildup to this match has been filled with excitement and anticipation, as Wales, led by their star player Gareth Bale, has exceeded expectations during the course of the tournament. Despite their relative inexperience on the international stage, Wales has shown great heart and determination, earning themselves a place in the final eight. On the other hand, Belgium has been touted as one of the favorites to lift the trophy since the beginning of the competition, and their talented lineup of players has only reinforced this belief. However, as it stands, the overwhelming support for Belgium might make the atmosphere in Lille a challenging proposition for the Welsh squad. Home advantage can play a significant role in matches of such magnitude, as crowds often help to spur their teams on to victory. This quarter-final matchup could just as well be played in Brussels, considering the multitude of Belgian fans predicted to be in attendance, along with their French allies. So, what has led to this extraordinary situation? Why are the French fans choosing to root for the opposition? Speculation points to a variety of factors. First and foremost, Belgium shares a common language and cultural similarities with France. This proximity in culture is bound to foster an affinity for the Belgian team. Additionally, there may be an element of fandom, as the Belgian Red Devils boast some of the most prominent stars in European football, such as Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne, and Romelu Lukaku. These players are adored by many football fans, irrespective of their nationality. Secondly, the Welsh team is largely seen as the underdogs in this encounter, which can be both a blessing and a curse. Whilst many neutral supporters typically gravitate towards the underdog for the sheer romanticism of an against-the-odds victory, the French crowd may be swayed by their belief in the overwhelming talent of the Belgian squad. This leviathan of support for one team may seem like a matter of life and death in the world of football, but the Welsh team and their fans should not despair. In such cases, the role of the underdog can be used as a motivational force, as it often fosters a sense of unity and defiance. With the odds heavily stacked against them, the Welsh side has nothing to lose and everything to gain. Moreover, as history has shown time and time again, in football, anything is possible. The stage is set for a thrilling encounter between Wales and Belgium in Lille. As the Welsh fans are heavily outnumbered, the match will undoubtedly be an uphill battle, overshadowed by the support for the opposition. However, if the Welsh team can withstand the pressure and use it to their advantage, they could create an unforgettable moment in football history. No matter the outcome, it is certain to be an enthralling ninety minutes of football that will live long in the memories of those involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Raging Bull Context: The film opens in 1964, where an older and fatter Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) practices his stand-up comic routine before his debut at a comedy nightclub. A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

He changes when he meets winsome Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie), and works night and day at strenuous odd jobs to accumulate the payment for a certain good farm so she'll marry him. On the very day payment is due, he wins the final needed amount at a target-shooting contest, but on being told that the farm has just been sold to his romantic rival, he returns to his dissolute ways. Late that night, he is struck by lightning during a rainstorm while en route to attack the man who had cheated him. Finding himself outside the meeting house where a revival is going, he goes in and undergoes a religious awakening and vows never to get angry at anyone ever again. He makes amends with the men who cheated him out of the land, and tries to with Gracie. When the U.S. declares war in World War I, York tries to avoid induction into the Army as a conscientious objector because of his religious beliefs, but is drafted nonetheless. His status as a conscientious objector is rejected since his church has no official standing, and he reluctantly reports to Camp Gordon for basic training. His superiors discover that he is a phenomenal marksman and decide to promote him to corporal. York still wants nothing to do with the Army and killing. Major Buxton (Stanley Ridges), his sympathetic commanding officer, tries to change York's mind, citing sacrifices made by others all throughout the history of the United States. He gives York a leave to go home and think it over. He promises York a recommendation for his exemption as a conscientious objector if York remains unconvinced.

Seeing all kinds of recent shooting incidents,I think it should be controlled more strictly than now. Somebody said that the person who has it in mind to kill another can do it without a gun,so the causes of murders are not guns but the trend of despising   life in the US. And they also insist that there is no clear evidence that the increasing number of murders is connected with possession  of guns,so the personal rights should not be restricted  by the reason that there is not enough evidence. Several months ago,I agreed with that partly. But as we know,the private groups like NRA have used the public opinion and persuaded the government to protect their profit. Other weapons such as knives,razors ,bats are made for their own usage. But guns are made for only one reason--to kill someone. Of course,there are people who have guns to protect themselves from the criminals. But crime is getting more cruel and severe nowadays,so actually even if someone has a gun,it is impossible to guard himself completely. As a substitute ,I think,if the possession of guns is controlled more strictly,people can live safer lives than now. There are other reasons to oppose the gun control (e.g.the possession of guns is historical inheritance  and represents that people's resistance  will be against tyrannical   government),but none of them can justify and explain today's serious situation in the US.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A birth plan is an outline of the mother’s preferences and expectations for her birth. As her birth advocate, it’s important that you are well-aware of her birth plan beforehand so you can communicate her needs to nurses or midwives when the time comes. Meet up with the mother and bring a pen/paper or laptop to record her preferences so there are no misunderstandings. Here is a sample printable birth plan that you can fill out, or use as a guide during your conversation: https://www.babycenter.com/ims/Content/my_birth_plan.pdf In order to effectively advocate during childbirth, you must be aware of what the mother expects you to do. This will vary based on the location of the birth and her individual preferences. Ask whether you will be the only guest during delivery and what she specifically would like you to do. Some women might like you to provide comfort services, such as calming massages or encouragement during delivery. Others may want your role to involve only communication with medical staff. One of your primary responsibilities as a birth advocate is to help the mother defend her decisions regarding pain medication. Have a clear idea of what her stance is, but also be flexible and understanding if complications arise and it is necessary.  If she has firmly decided in advance that she does not want to use medication, inform the medical staff of her decision in advance and again once she is admitted for delivery. If she is in considerable pain and seems to want to change her decision about medication, ask whether she would like to consider it or if she would like to continue with her goal of a medication-free birth. Ultimately, she always has the final say. Support her decision either way. Medical staff often asks repeatedly about pain management and are willing to accommodate requests at many points during delivery. There is often a point during delivery after which staff cannot perform an epidural, however. This may be the appropriate time to convey a single offer of pain medication during delivery if the mother previously decided against it; otherwise do not bother her with repeated offers. There are a variety of positions that can work for the different phases of labor, and it’s worth looking into what would be the most comfortable for the mother. You can even practice some of these positions with her beforehand to get a sense of what she likes. Some examples include being on her hands and knees, sitting, lying on her side, or squatting. The hospital or birthing center staff will need to be able to monitor the baby’s heartbeat to make sure that it’s normal and healthy. However, sometimes there are different ways to go about this, and it’s good to know what the mother would prefer. Typically, the baby’s heartbeat will be monitored externally using a belt tied around the mother’s belly for the first 20-30 minutes after the mother is admitted to a hospital. There are alternatives to external monitoring:  Internal monitoring involves placing an electrode on the part of the fetus closest to the cervix. Wireless external monitoring: Instead of a belt, some hospitals have technology that will monitor the fetus wirelessly and allow the mother to move around during labor. Many recent health findings suggest that immediate cord clamping isn’t recommended unless the baby is having trouble breathing. Delayed cord clamping allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the baby, which can be especially helpful for early preterm infants. Even during deliveries that a mother intended to be entirely natural, certain circumstances may require medical intervention or surgery. Cesarean birth (sometimes called a C-section) is the most common form of surgical delivery, and it comes with its own set of risks and complications.  If the mother has expressed in advance a decision to avoid intervention if possible, inform medical staff of this choice upon admission to the birth unit and ask that they discuss potential interventions with you prior to mentioning it to her, particularly if the intervention is purely optional. If an intervention becomes necessary for the health or life of the mother or her baby, it is your responsibility to convey the severity of the situation to the mother and allow her to make a decision in line with her values. Once she has decided, defend her choice to the medical staff and offer continual support and encouragement to the mother, especially if she had to accept intervention when she had not desired or anticipated it. Ask if the mother wants to hold her baby right away after birth so you can communicate this wish to health care providers. Immediate skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby after birth has been shown to have a number of physiological benefits, including easing breastfeeding and decreasing stress hormones in the baby.  If the baby is healthy and does not need immediate medical attention, hospital procedures can delay measuring and weighing of the baby for up to an hour after birth. If the mother will be delivering in an institutional setting but would like to breastfeed her baby, part of your role as a birth advocate is to inform nursing staff of the mother’s decision and request that the baby be allowed to stay with the mother as much as possible to facilitate breastfeeding. Childbirth is a highly personal experience and every woman may have unique expectations, desires, and opinions surrounding her upcoming labor. Do your best to understand and support her decisions. For example, if the mother wants to try to have a completely natural birth, you can ask her about her reasons for wanting to do this, but ultimately be supportive of her decision. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the importance of understanding a mother's birth plan and being her birth advocate, stressing effective communication with the mother, medical staff, and others involved in the birthing process. As a birth advocate, one should be knowledgeable about the mother's preferences on pain management, birth positions, monitoring options, delayed cord clamping, medical interventions, and post-birth mother-baby interactions, and support her decisions during the entire childbirth process, while also being flexible and understanding when faced with any complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jumping can help kids build the muscles they need to be strong runners. Before you begin to practice running, lead the kids through a set of jumping jacks or let them use a jump rope.","output":"These fun and engaging activities not only warm up their muscles but also improve their cardiovascular fitness and coordination, making them better prepared for running. Encourage them to perform multiple sets of jumping jacks and alternate between single and double jumps with the jump rope to keep them motivated and challenged.  Incorporate various running drills. Once the kids are warmed up, start incorporating a variety of running drills aimed at improving their technique and overall speed. Some effective drills to consider are high knees, butt kicks, and stride-outs. High knees help improve leg turnover and engage key leg muscles, while butt kicks increase hamstring flexibility and stride efficiency. Stride-outs, a combination of jogging and sprinting, encourage kids to focus on their form and gradually lengthen their stride. Practice sprints and intervals. Sprinting and interval training are essential components for increasing speed. Set up short distances for children to sprint, starting with 10 to 20 meters. Encourage them to concentrate on fast starts, arm swing, and maintaining a consistent pace. As they become more comfortable and confident in their running abilities, gradually increase the distance. Intervals can also be added; have the children alternate between sprinting and walking or jogging to help build endurance and speed simultaneously.  Teach proper running form. Understanding and implementing correct running form are crucial for running faster and preventing injuries. Teach kids to run tall with their heads up, keep their shoulders relaxed, and practice a slight forward lean at the hips. Remind them to avoid crossing their arms in front of the body and to maintain efficient, controlled arm swings. It's essential that they practice landing on the balls of their feet to minimize stress on the joints and support quicker leg turnover. Strengthen core and leg muscles. Encourage kids to participate in exercises that strengthen their core and leg muscles, as these muscle groups play a vital role in running speed and endurance. Hold planking exercises for core strength and perform lunges, squats, and calf raises to build strong leg muscles. These exercises will help them generate more power and maintain proper running form, thus improving their overall speed. Include hill workouts. Hill workouts are a great way to improve children's running speed and build strength. Find a gentle slope or hill for the kids to run up and have them practice maintaining proper form on the incline. Encourage them to lean into the hill, drive the knees high and use their arms for momentum. Gradually increase the steepness and length of the hill to build strength and endurance. Running downhill should also not be overlooked, as it can teach children how to control their descent and improve speed. Play fun speed games. Kids learn best when they're having fun, so incorporate enjoyable games that promote faster running. Relay races, tag, and capture the flag are excellent examples of games that involve quick bursts of speed and agility. These games allow children to practice running skills in an interactive and entertaining environment while promoting friendly competition amongst peers. Reinforce positive feedback and goal setting. Lastly, always provide positive feedback and support for the children as they learn how to run faster. Encourage them to set achievable goals for themselves and celebrate their progress along the way. Helping them understand the importance of persistence and hard work will contribute to their ongoing growth and improvement in running speed as well as other aspects of their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8]  and the situation: There were Two villages Berg village situated at 3000 ft, at the base of the mountain, and Steep village, situated at 8500 feet. People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village.

Under his progressive government the old regime was tenuously reconciled to his liberal policies. During this period of upheaval in the provinces he declared that all the estates of the Church, its congregations, and its religious orders were national property—though in Valencia, most of this property was subsequently acquired by the local bourgeoisie. City life in Valencia carried on in a revolutionary climate, with frequent clashes between liberals and republicans, and the constant threat of reprisals by the Carlist troops of General Cabrera.\\"?

Given the fact \\"light can travel through a vacuum\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"A product of what can travel through a vacuum?\\"","output":"A product of electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum. Light, as an electromagnetic wave, is a product of interacting electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space. These electromagnetic waves do not require a medium like air or water in order to travel. As such, they can effectively traverse a vacuum – an area devoid of any matter – at the speed of light (approximately 299,792 kilometers per second or 186,282 miles per second). Electromagnetic waves demonstrate a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies, and they are collectively represented in the electromagnetic spectrum. This spectrum is divided into several regions: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each region corresponds to specific applications and effects on matter. Visible light, which is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that human eyes can detect, comprises only a small segment of the entire spectrum. It consists of different colors, ranging from red (longer wavelength) to violet (shorter wavelength). Other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, which are not visible to the human eye, also have the ability to travel through a vacuum. In summary, a product of electromagnetic waves, including visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, can travel through a vacuum. Their ability to do so is a result of the inherent nature of electromagnetic waves, which are self-propagating energy transfers consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that do not require a physical medium for transmission."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which brother studied more about how rocks usually move several centimeters?  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

Summarize: Surrey piled up 323-8 thanks to half-centuries from Steven Davies (79), Rory Burns (50) and Sam Curran (57), while Liam Norwell took three wickets. Curran also shared a stand of 89 with brother Tom to propel Surrey past 300. The visitors slumped to 158 all out in just the 34th over, with Surrey skipper Gareth Batty taking 5-41 and paceman Jade Dernbach claiming 3-33. Gloucestershire beat Surrey by six runs in last September's showpiece at Lord's despite Dernbach taking a career-best 6-35 including a hat-trick. The right-arm fast bowler found himself on a hat-trick once again early in the Gloucestershire chase when he removed Michael Klinger and debutant Phil Mustard, but Ian Cockbain survived the next ball. Cockbain (35) and Hamish Marshall (55) led a brief recovery from 24-3 with a stand of 85, but both fell when well set and Gloucestershire lost their last seven wickets for 49 with Batty's spin doing the damage. The Curran brothers showed their ability with the bat in Surrey's innings - their seventh-wicket partnership coming at almost eight runs an over to take the hosts from 215-6 to 304-7. Summary:","output":"Surrey secured a dominant victory against Gloucestershire, posting a total of 323-8, largely due to contributions from Steven Davies (79), Rory Burns (50), and Sam Curran (57).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The city re-elected the mayor. What is a plausible cause? Choose your answer from: (a). The city cut its budget.; (b). The mayor fulfilled his promises.;","output":"(b). The mayor fulfilled his promises. A plausible cause for the re-election of the mayor in the given scenario is that the mayor has successfully fulfilled his promises, which contributed to an improvement in the quality of life for the city's residents and led to widespread support for his re-election. In today's world, it is essential for leaders to deliver on their commitments and maintain public trust to secure their position in power for consecutive terms. These are some factors indicating how the mayor's fulfillment of promises could have played a significant role in their re-election: 1. Public Trust: When a mayor makes promises and effectively implements policies that uphold those commitments, the public's trust in that leader is strengthened. A mayor who honors their word is more likely to secure the loyalty of the voter base, ultimately leading to their re-election. 2. Improved Infrastructure and Services: Effective leadership can positively impact the quality of the city's infrastructure and public services. If the mayor delivered on promises related to improving roadways, public transportation, schools, healthcare facilities, and other essential services, citizens are more likely to support the mayor's re-election. 3. Economic Growth: If the mayor promised to foster economic development within the city, and the results were visible and tangible – new businesses, job opportunities, and increased overall prosperity – citizens would likely attribute this success to the mayor's effective leadership, warranting a re-election. 4. Increased Public Safety: A crucial aspect of a mayor's job is ensuring the safety and well-being of citizens. If the mayor fulfilled their promises to invest in public safety (such as law enforcement, emergency services, and disaster preparedness) and crime rates significantly dropped, residents would be more inclined to vote for the mayor in the next election. 5. Social and Environmental Initiatives: Another critical factor contributing to the re-election of a mayor is how well they address social and environmental issues. If the mayor demonstrated responsiveness and proactivity in tackling problems like poverty, homelessness, or pollution, voters may feel more confident in electing the mayor for another term. 6. Effective Communication and Engagement: Mayors who honor their promises often make conscious efforts to maintain open lines of communication with citizens – through town halls, social media, and other avenues – to keep them informed about ongoing projects and initiatives. Engaging with the public in such a manner can enhance their confidence in the mayor's leadership and encourage them to vote for the same candidate again. 7. Partnerships and Collaborations: A successful mayor collaborates with various stakeholders, including local businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies, to build partnerships that benefit the city as a whole. By fulfilling promises and fostering these relationships, a mayor can create opportunities for multiple sectors, making their leadership invaluable and strengthening their case for re-election. In conclusion, the mayor's successful completion of promises displays an unwavering commitment to the city's well-being and the citizens' primary concerns. This achievement establishes the mayor as a trustworthy, effective, and dedicated leader who can bring about meaningful change. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that fulfilling promises has significantly contributed to the mayor's re-election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I don't reckon the sun's ever come up quite the same since the day it happened. I've been watching it for years now and to me it still don't look right somehow. Maybe it's just me thinking it, sending myself doolally after what I've done. But I swear every morning it creeps up and it's looking at me, all knowing like. And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since. But however tight I shut them curtains to stop that damn sun lighting me up, it still don't stop the inside of my head from pounding out the truth. No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way. The deaf and dumb lass went by the name of Mitzi Barker. Her being deaf and dumb, she was the kind of lass you went up the lane with if you didn't want no-one shouting their gob off about it after. Funny but it's the small things I recall best about her, like the way her hair reeked of bonfires and how that little old checkered dress of hers rode right up her thigh with no help from me. After we'd finished our business we'd head over the trout farm and I'd hunker down and poach us up a couple of rainbows for our tea. That Mitzi Barker, she was thin as an ear of barley and I always figured a good nosh-up was the least I could do for her troubles. The narrator and Mitzi would eat trout: - Never. - after they had relations. - not enough information - before they would have relations.","output":"The sun, perceived as a relentless observer, has been a source of guilt and a constant reminder of the narrator's transgression. Over the years, the sun appears to rise each day, casting judgment on the narrator for the actions they’ve committed. This psychological burden of guilt and remorse has driven the narrator to isolate themselves, as if trying to escape the truth about what happened. Despite the narrator's attempts to evade the sun's watchful eye, there seems to be no escape from the tormenting thoughts that continue to haunt them. This lasting remorse is connected to a deaf and dumb girl named Mitzi Barker. Her inability to speak or hear might have afforded the narrator some level of protection from the prying ears and judgmental whispers of the community. They thought their secret encounters would stay hidden, but in reality, they continue to deal with the consequences long after their trysts. The narrator's fond memories of Mitzi reflect the subtle details that linger in the corners of their mind. The distinct scent of bonfires in her hair and the way her checkered dress would playfully expose her thigh demonstrate strong nostalgia. As they reminisce about their encounters, the seclusion of their location and the pleasure of enjoying a freshly poached trout meal create an atmosphere of intimacy and longing for days gone by. However, the fact remains that their actions have brought about an undeniable sense of guilt. The silent burden weighs heavily upon the narrator's conscience, as they wish for a chance to atone for their mistakes by explaining themselves to Mitzi, perhaps hoping that her understanding would free them from the relentless judgment of the sun. In a way, the narrator's desire to face Mitzi and seek redemption is their only hope to alleviate the torment within. In essence, the narrator's vivid recollections and emotional turmoil paint a picture of a deeply troubled individual who, even after many years, cannot escape the consequences of their actions. The sun, a symbol of the narrator's guilt and judgment, remains a constant, unforgiving presence. Despite the unlikeliness of amending the relationship with Mitzi, the remorseful longing for a chance to right their wrongs persists within the narrator. This combination of nostalgia and regret suggests that the relationship between the narrator and Mitzi was a complex entanglement of emotions and desires, where the consumption of trout after their encounters serves as a visual representation of the duality of their guilty pleasures and unfulfilled desires."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Their mission fails: Phelps is shot, his wife Claire seemingly dies in a car bombing, and the rest of the team except agent Ethan Hunt are eliminated by unknown assassins. Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge, Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF team sent to keep an eye on them, and learns the job was a setup to lure out a mole within IMF. The mole is believed to be in contact with an arms dealer known as \\"Max\\" as part of \\"Job 314.\\" As Hunt is the only member left, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees. Returning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes \\"Job 314\\" refers to Bible verse Job 3:14, with \\"Job\\" as the mole's code name. Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining she escaped the bomb after Phelps aborted the mission. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, where he warns her that the list she possesses has a tracking device. He promises to deliver the real list in return for 10 million and Job's identity. Hunt, Max, and her agents escape just as a CIA team arrives. Hunt recruits two disavowed IMF agents: computer expert Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno). They infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, steal the real list, and flee to London. Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt's mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking. He provides media coverage of the arrest, forcing Hunt to contact him from Liverpool Street Station. Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London before hanging up, but is surprised to find Phelps nearby. Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming Kittridge as the mole.

Solve this instance: By Conor MacauleyBBC NI Agriculture & Environment Correspondent Andrew Crawford said the accusation had been made by a senior civil servant at a Stormont committee in January 2017. He said he then became the focus of a media and political storm leading to his resignation days later. He had been DUP leader Arlene Foster's adviser at the finance department. He had followed her there from the enterprise department, where she had responsibility for the scheme. Mr Crawford said he had provided the inquiry with evidence that proved he had not been seeking to keep the scheme open when it was haemorrhaging public money. \\"For people to say, at that stage, that I was trying to keep the scheme open, runs contrary to what I was doing at that time and what evidence I can produce to the inquiry and have produced to the inquiry,\\" he said. Counsel to the inquiry Joseph Aiken QC said the public perception of special advisers (Spads) was that they lived \\"in the shadows but are wielding a lot of power\\". Mr Crawford replied that he considered Spads were most effective when they were \\"anonymous\\" or in the background helping their minister. Analysis By Jayne McCormack, digital politics reporter Wednesday's session gave an insight into the secretive world of Stormont's special advisers and how much power they can wield. Andrew Crawford seemed to start off nervously, but settled in as he was quizzed about the training he was given when he began working as a DUP special adviser in 2007. He said he didn't recall ever receiving any formal training, but did get advice from other special advisers about the \\"dos and don'ts\\" involved in carrying out the role. Mr Crawford also sought to point out that his job was \\"purely to advise the minister\\" - telling the inquiry it's ultimately up to ministers what decisions they make. That claim may prove to be somewhat contentious when the DUP ministers who oversaw the running of the scheme give their evidence to the inquiry. \\"I always believed that if you became the story you couldn't advise behind the scenes,\\" he added. He said the media and public attention on him after the accusation by a senior civil servant before the Public Accounts Committee in January 2017 left him in a position where he felt he had to quit. He said he now focused mainly on farming and did some part-time policy work for the DUP. In his witness statement to the inquiry, Mr Crawford said he sent confidential government proposals for cost-control measures in the RHI scheme to two relatives, months before they were made public. He said he now accepted that had been \\"inappropriate\\" and he regretted it. The RHI scheme was an initiative offering financial incentives to encourage businesses to switch to using renewable fuels to generate heat. But critical flaws meant that its claimants could earn substantial returns, far greater than intended. The cost controls on the scheme were needed to deal with increasing pressure on the budget as the number of applications began to steadily rise. In the weeks between the controls being announced in September 2015 and being introduced that November, hundreds of applications flooded into the scheme crashing the budget and ultimately forcing its closure. 'Clear rationale' Mr Crawford also told the RHI inquiry that nationalist politicians could resist wholescale adoption of GB legislation to Northern Ireland. He said such resistance was sometimes \\"factored in\\" by his former minister Arlene Foster when it came to decision making. The inquiry has heard suggestions that the RHI debacle may never have happened if Northern Ireland officials had simply copied an existing GB scheme. It had a much bigger support network running it. Part of the problem in Northern Ireland was the lack of staff, most of whom had no energy expertise. Mr Crawford said when it came to policy, nationalist politicians in Sinn Féin and the SDLP would have had \\"issues with powers remaining at Westminster\\". He said unionist politicians had to have a \\"clear rationale\\" for following Westminster's policy lead. Witness line-up \\"I'm not saying they would be opposed to it, but you would have to work your way through why we were not devolving the power ourselves,\\" he told the inquiry. He said it was part of the process that would have been going through his and Arlene Foster's mind when it came to policy decisions. He said it was also something that would have been considered by civil servants, \\"albeit they are politically neutral\\". Meanwhile, the list of witnesses lined up for next week now looks set to be changed. Inquiry chair Sir Patrick Coghlin said he wants to hear evidence from Andrew Crawford and Arlene Foster at the same time. It is hoped they might be able to give evidence on additional days next week. Sir Patrick said the panel felt it was important that continuity of their evidence, which was closely bound up, was not lost.

Which family got diabetes 2 because of junk-food?  The Jones family and the Bell family both entered a medical study for diabetes.The members of Jones family had mostly type 1 diabetes, while Bell family members had type 2 diabetes because they ate junk-food.  Hint: Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells no longer respond normally to insulin. The pancreas still makes insulin, but the cells of the body can’t use it. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes.

A:","output":"The Bell family got type 2 diabetes because of junk-food."},{"instruction":"I read this background article the other day: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which island was inhabited by fewer tuataras?","output":"Based on the information from the background article, there is only one living species of tuatara, Sphenodon punctatus. The new situation specifies that Snake Island is a reptile paradise with many species of reptiles, while Bird Island has few reptiles.

The Florida Gun Supply website says he is raising legal funds for himself and the store's owner, who in July declared his business a \\"Muslim-free zone\\".      The Confederate battle flag is seen as a symbol of slavery to its critics.      But its supporters today say it is an important part of southern heritage.      Florida Gun Supply owner Andy Hallinan said he teamed up with Mr Zimmerman, who was acquitted in 2013 of killing black teenager Trayvon Martin, to sell copies of his Confederate flag artwork.      Mr Zimmerman later tweeted about his reason for painting the flag.      \\"I painted the confederate flag backed by the American flag because I believe that anything can stand with the American flag behind it.\\"      He added: \\"My confederate flag painting also represents the hypocrisy of political correctness that is plaguing this nation.\\"      'Splitting the proceeds'      A post on the store's website said Mr Zimmerman painted it \\"in honour\\" of Mr Hallinan \\"for being a true patriot and leading the country into a better, safer America\\".      Andy Hallinan courted controversy last month when he announced in a YouTube video that his Florida shooting range was closed to Muslims.      Mr Zimmerman said he decided to paint the flag after hearing that the Council on American-Islamic Relations was taking legal action against Mr Hallinan.      At the time, Mr Hallinan said his decision was inspired by the Chattanooga shooting, which was carried out by a man born in Kuwait who spent several years living in the US.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption George Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in 2013      Copies of the painting are selling for 50 a piece, each signed and numbered by Mr Zimmerman. It is unclear how many copies have so far been sold.      Mr Zimmerman's last painting, which features a blue American flag with the words \\"God, one nation, with liberty and justice for all\\", sold on Ebay for over 100,000.      His acquittal in 2013 stirred fierce debate on racial profiling and self-defence laws in the US.      It also helped spark the #BlackLivesMatter movement and continues to be a rallying cry for civil rights campaigners.      There has also been a backlash over the Confederate flag in recent months, after the man charged with killing nine black people at a church in Charleston in June was pictured holding it. ||||| Buy a Print Today and You're Entered to Win George's Original Confederate Flag Painting (Which could be worth up to 100,000!)

Zimmerman's Confederate Flag FAQs:      All art has a story to tell. What's George's story?      George started painting an American Flag on this canvas, but heard about Andy getting sued by CAIR (the Counsel for American/Islamic Relations) while he was working on the painting. George decided to scrap the original American Flag painting and repaint it with a Confederate (Battle) Flag.      ​George painted the confederate flag backed by the American flag because he believed that anything can stand with the American flag behind it. George's confederate flag painting also represents the hypocrisy of political correctness that is plaguing this nation. Politicians across the nation have demanded it's removal; however, not one leader including, but not limited to Barack Hussein Obama demanded the posters displaying a 10,000 bounty on my head, \\"dead or alive,\\" to be removed.​      What a story!      On the back of the original canvas, you can still see an outline of the American Flag.      Isn't the Confederate Flag racist?      No way!      The Confederate Flag HAS been used by a small amount of people to incite racism, however, it has not become a symbol of racism. You cannot assume everyone who flies a Confederate Flag is racist in the same way that you cannot judge every Muslim to be a terrorist, or every gun owner to be a serial killer.      The media is calling you racist. Why are they calling you racist if you're not?      Watch the entire video above, from start to finish. The media isn't interested in spreading the TRUTH about topics. The REAL reason George and Andy have teamed up to sell the Confederate Flag is much less important to the media than continuing to make a villain out of both George and Andy.      4 days after George was found not guilty of murder, he helped pull a family out of an overturned SUV that was on fire. The media didn't bother to report on that because it wouldn't make him look like the evil man they paint him as.      Andy recently paid for and planned the entire funeral for a family involved in a road rage murder. The media didn't bother to report on that because it doesn't make Andy look like a villain either.      The media will ONLY share the point of view that makes them sell more papers. That's all they're interested in.      How big is the print?      The print is 24\\"x18\\", which is the exact same size as the original.      How long will it take to receive my print?

A percentage of the proceeds will also go directly to a charity of our choosing.

Two weeks ago, the owners of a beautiful Siamese cat packaged up some DVDs to send to Worthing, West Sussex. The parcel was sealed and posted from Falmouth in Cornwall, arriving safely at its destination some 8 days after it had been sent.      Imagine how surprised the recipient was when, along with the anticipated DVDs, an elegant Siamese cat emerged from the box. This person was somewhat startled as they were not expecting to receive a free cat along with their order of DVDs.The stunned buyer recovered themselves enough to contact the RSPCA who collected the cat and brought her to Grove Lodge Vets for a thorough health check. On arrival, we scanned this gorgeous girl to check for a microchip . Everyone was delighted when a chip was located and even more so when we found that the contact details were up to date and we were able to contact her owners straightaway.

Write an email with the following subject: Global Custody Agreement","output":"Subject: Global Custody Agreement: Comprehensive Overview and Strategic Partnership Opportunities Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the prospect of a Global Custody Agreement between our institutions. As our companies continue to expand and serve clients in new and diverse markets, it has become increasingly essential to secure and manage assets entrusted to us by investors across the globe. With this in mind, I would like to provide you with a comprehensive overview of a Global Custody Agreement and explore how a strategic partnership between our organizations can contribute to seamless cross-border transactions and enhanced services for our valued clients. Global Custody Agreement Overview A Global Custody Agreement is a legal agreement between a financial institution (the \\"custodian\\") and its client, which outlines the terms and conditions under which the custodian will safeguard and manage the client's financial assets. This agreement encompasses a wide range of services, such as the collection and processing of dividends, interest payments, tax withholdings, and corporate actions, as well as providing reporting and performance measurement. The benefits of a Global Custody Agreement include the following: 1. Risk Mitigation: A Global Custody Agreement ensures that both parties understand the roles and responsibilities associated with handling a client's assets. This clarity can promote operational efficiency and reduce the risk of errors or disputes, which could potentially lead to losses for the asset owner. 2. Enhanced Reporting and Compliance: Global Custody Agreements typically include provisions that outline the specific reports and statements to be provided by the custodian, fostering transparency and enabling clients to make informed decisions regarding their assets. Additionally, the custodian may offer valuable expertise to help the client navigate complex regulatory environments across multiple jurisdictions. 3. Streamlined Administration: By consolidating asset management functions under a single custodian, clients can alleviate the administrative burden associated with managing multiple relationships, thereby potentially realizing cost savings and improved operational efficiency. Strategic Partnership Opportunities As we consider entering a Global Custody Agreement, I suggest identifying and targeting areas of shared expertise and complementary services that our companies can leverage to enhance our respective offerings. Some potential partnership opportunities include: 1. Technology Integration: By combining our advanced technology platforms, we could offer clients a seamless integration of their portfolio management systems, streamlining access to investment data, portfolio analysis, and reporting tools. This collaborative approach can contribute to the enhancement of both our firms' client services. 2. Cross-Referral Opportunities: By developing a mutual understanding of our companies' unique strengths and offerings, we can identify opportunities for cross-referral, ultimately leveraging each other's expertise to increase our market presence and provide the best possible solutions to our clientele. 3. Joint Ventures: Exploring co-investment opportunities by pooling resources and expertise may lead to lucrative investment outcomes for our clients. This approach would further solidify our strategic alliance and further the mutual benefit of our organizations. To initiate discussions surrounding a Global Custody Agreement, I propose scheduling a meeting at your earliest convenience to assess the possible synergies between our institutions. I kindly request that you share your thoughts on this proposal and provide me with a few dates when you would be available for a call or an in-person meeting. As our firms strive to provide unparalleled financial services, a Global Custody Agreement could foster an enhanced client experience, improved efficiencies, and long-term growth for both our organizations. I look forward to exploring this mutually beneficial opportunity together. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Given the following context:  A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket.  Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes.  answer the following question:  What movie does the accountant watch?","output":"The accountant watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a nail . Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread , known as a female thread ( internal thread ) , often in the form of a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it . Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted . The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects .  - A fastener is a hardware device that mechanically joins or affixes two or more objects together. In general, fasteners are used to create non-permanent joints; that is, joints that can be removed or dismantled without damaging the joining components. Welding is an example of creating permanent joints.   - An inclined plane, also known as a ramp, is a flat supporting surface tilted at an angle, with one end higher than the other, used as an aid for raising or lowering a load. The inclined plane is one of the six classical simple machines defined by Renaissance scientists. Inclined planes are widely used to move heavy loads over vertical obstacles; examples vary from a ramp used to load goods into a truck, to a person walking up a pedestrian ramp, to an automobile or railroad train climbing a grade.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.  - Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which is distinct from lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce a weld.  - A simple machine is a mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force. In general, they can be defined as the simplest mechanisms that use mechanical advantage (also called leverage) to multiply force. Usually the term refers to the six classical simple machines which were defined by Renaissance scientists:  A simple machine uses a single applied force to do work against a single load force. Ignoring friction losses, the work done on the load is equal to the work done by the applied force. The machine can increase the amount of the output force, at the cost of a proportional decrease in the distance moved by the load. The ratio of the output to the applied force is called the \\"mechanical advantage\\".

Summarize the following: Everyone has a different way of organizing their desk and their tools. Yours will depend on the kind of work you do at your desk. Make sure that whatever you do, it keeps the space usable and clear of distractions.  You might want to use different kinds of containers for different items. You might need file folders or a bulletin board to pin things to. You may have lots of tools that need to be hung on hooks. If you mostly use your desk for office work, don't keep your craft supplies there. Choose a different place in your room or office to keep those things.  If you have noticed that a certain item rarely or never gets used, don't keep it at your desk. If there's a tool or resource that you use a lot but have been keeping elsewhere, create a space for it at your desk. If you've been having a hard time staying organized or keeping your desk clean, this could be a sign that you need to create a different organizational method. If you've kept everything in drawers, maybe shelves or hooks would be better for you. If you have a hard time focusing on your computer screen, maybe you need to clear everything else out of sight.

The Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin - encrusted with 245 diamonds, boasting 18-karat white gold hardware and crafted from extremely pale crocodile skin - sent bidders into a frenzy via phone, online and in person at Heritage Auctions in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. Managing Director of the auction house, Kathleen Guzman told CBS MoneyWatch: 'Hermès raises crocodiles on its own farm, breeding them to have very light coloring. 'But then to search for a crocodile that has almost an albino skin is extraordinarily rare.' Insured: OPTIONS: - Beverly Hills has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately' - CBS MoneyWatch has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately' - Heritage Auctions has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately' - Hermès has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately' - Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately' - Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin Bag has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately' - Kathleen Guzman has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately' - Los Angeles has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately'","output":"Among the options provided, the most sensible sentence to follow the narrative would be:  - Hermès has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately'.  This sentence successfully intersects with the topic, as Hermès is the principal manufacturer of the Birkin bag. As a homogeneously linked organization with the product, it would be logical for Hermès to provide a warranty or assurance for repair services.  Let's discuss why the other options would not fit as readily into the narrative.  1. 'Beverly Hills has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately'' - Beverly Hills is a location, not an entity that would typically offer repair services for luxury goods.     2. 'CBS MoneyWatch has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately'' - CBS MoneyWatch is a media platform, and it is implausible for a news organization to provide repair services for such products.      3. 'Heritage Auctions has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately'' - Although Heritage Auctions is the place where the bag was sold, it is not commonly the auction house's responsibility to provide repair services for the items they auction. Their role typically ends after the item is sold. 4. 'Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin and Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin Bag have promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately'' - These are the actual names of the bag and, as such, cannot provide services. 5. 'Kathleen Guzman has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately'' - Unless Kathleen Guzman has specific expertise in repairing luxury bags, it would be odd for her to provide such a service. Her role as Managing Director of Heritage Auctions doesn’t typically involve the maintenance of the auctioned items. 6. 'Los Angeles has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately'' - Los Angeles, as a city, doesn't provide specialized services such as repair for designer bags.  Given the aforementioned analyses, the sentence \\"Hermès has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately'\\" would nest seamlessly into the context and maintain the coherence of the given narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Soil that’s constantly damp attracts pests, including gnats, and promotes mold growth. While you shouldn’t let your plants wilt or turn yellow, try to hold off watering until the soil is completely dry.  To test the soil, stick your finger about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) into the surface. If dirt sticks to your finger, it’s probably best to hold off watering, unless your plants look sad. It’s also best to use containers with drainage holes in the bottom. If your pots sit on saucers that collect excess water, be sure to drain them after you water your plants. Nematodes are tiny worms that eat the larvae gnats, fleas, and other pests. You can purchase them at a garden center; look for a product labeled for gnat control that contains the nematode species Steinernema feltiae.  Typically, you mix beneficial nematodes with water, then add the mixture to your soil. Check your product’s label for specific instructions. Beneficial nematodes are safe for people, plants, and pets, so try not to get grossed out or worry about harmful health effects. Mix a teaspoon or less of gentle hand or dish soap with a 1 US pint (470 mL) of lukewarm water. Add the mixture to a spray bottle, then spritz your plants’ leaves. After 2 or 3 hours, rinse the leaves thoroughly with water.  While they’re more expensive, you can also purchase insecticidal plant soaps at a garden center. Using a homemade soap spray increases the risk of leaf damage. It’s wise to test the spray on a small area before spraying an entire plant. As a rule of thumb, if a soap dries out or irritates your skin, it’s probably too harsh for your plants. your plants if other methods don’t work. If you haven’t had success keeping flies out of your plants, it’s time to transplant them. Water the plant, remove it from the old pot, then gently shake away as much soil as possible from the root system.  Fill a new pot nearly to the top with fresh potting soil. Dig a hole in the center large enough to accommodate the roots, bury them, then cover them with soil. If your gnat problem persists after transplanting, you might need to resort to chemical treatment. Head to your local garden center for a plant-safe liquid insecticide labeled for flying insects.

Consequently, recycling trucks will pick up more items that are able to be reused. As these recyclable items travel to the recycling plant, the plant will receive larger amounts of material to sort and process. This means that more items will be broken down into small parts, and subsequently, more raw parts will be created.

It was donated by Sir Montague Allan of Ravenscrag, Montreal, and has been competed for since 1909. The current champions are the Bentley Generals of Alberta, who captured the 2016 Allan Cup in Steinbach, Manitoba.  - St. Moritz (also , , ) is a high Alpine luxury resort in the Engadine in Switzerland, at an elevation of about above sea level. It is Upper Engadine's major village and a municipality in the district of Maloja in the Swiss canton of Graubünden.  - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location.  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - The Engadin or Engadine (, , ; lit.: \\"Valley of the Inn people\\") is a long high Alpine valley region in the eastern Swiss Alps located in the canton of Graubünden in most southeastern Switzerland with about 25,000 inhabitants. It follows the route of the Inn from its headwaters at Maloja Pass in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into Austria, one hundred kilometers downstream. The En/Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Donau, as the only Swiss river. The Engadine is protected by high mountain ranges on all sides and is famous for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes and outdoor activities.  - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - John Howard Louis Lecompte ( July 28 , 1914 -- February 21 , 1970 ) was a Canadian ice hockey player .

As of 2013, operating 258 manned aircraft and 9 unmanned aerial vehicles, the Royal Canadian Air Force consists of 14,500 Regular Force and 2,600 Primary Reserve personnel, supported by 2,500 civilians. Lieutenant-General Michael J. Hood, , is the current Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force and Chief of the Air Force Staff.  - The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point, most commonly a reference geoid, a mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface (see Geodetic system, vertical datum). Elevation, or geometric height, is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface, such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit, and depth is used for points below the surface.  - The 1948 Winter Olympics, officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"Ves Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\") (German: \\"Olympische Winterspiele 1948\\") (Italian: \\"V Giochi olimpici invernali\\") (Romansh: \\"Gieus olimpics d'enviern 1948\\"), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in 1948 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II; it had been 12 years since the last Winter Games in 1936. From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany, the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the Games. The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war. These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edström.  - The RCAF Flyers was a senior amateur Canadian ice hockey team, based out of Ottawa. The team was made up of active and former Royal Canadian Air Force members and some army personnel. The club won the gold medal in the 1948 Winter Olympics. The club also won the Allan Cup Canadian championship in 1942.  - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective.

It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015.  - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.

Last week I received a telephone call from a woman who could not stop crying as she told me that one of my stories had saved her son from committing suicide. In closing she called me a hero.      That got me thinking about what a hero is. Was I a hero because I pulled a family from a burning car? If so, how could I be a hero just because I wrote a story that saved someone's life?      Today I decided to look up the word \\"hero\\" in the dictionary to see exactly what it meant. It read \\"a person who does. something brave\\". As I read on, it also said \\"a person who is good and noble \\".      That statement impressed me more than the part about being brave. So I thought about something very important. Say I was walking into the local Wal-Mart Store and I happened to open, and hold the door for someone as a _ .

Having been near \\"the end of my rope\\", after my marriage of twenty years ended, I was in such a condition. I was within hours trying to get enough courage to end the pain and misery. When I returned home, someone had sent me a card in the mail which told me how much they would appreciate me as a friend. That wonderful card probably saved my life. That person, without even knowing it, saved a life and became a hero.

He was one of the longest tenured players in the National Hockey League, and is a three-time Stanley Cup champion - one with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Detroit Red Wings. On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Chelios became part of the second group of players to be named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. Chelios played for the Montreal Canadiens, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and briefly for the Atlanta Thrashers. In 1984, he made the Montreal Canadiens for good, and distinguished himself with his play. During his early days, Chelios was known for his offensive abilities, and his teammates even called him \\"Soft Hands Chelios.\\" He earned a trip to the National Hockey League All-Star Game and was named to the 1985 NHL All-Rookie Team. He scored 64 points in 74 games, a high total for a defenseman, even in the higher-scoring 1980s. He came second to Mario Lemieux for the Calder Memorial Trophy. In the playoffs that year, he scored 10 points in 9 games, with a +17 plus/minus. Although he only played 41 games in the 1985-86 season, he won his first Stanley Cup, playing in front of Conn Smythe Trophy winner Patrick Roy.  Following two more good seasons, Chelios really broke out in the 1988-89 season. He scored 73 points in 80 games at +35, was named to the All-Star First-Team, and won the James Norris Memorial Trophy. During that year's Wales Conference (now Eastern Conference) Finals series against the Philadelphia Flyers (which the Canadiens won in six games), Chelios became reviled by Flyer fans for a dirty hit on Brian Propp that left the Philadelphia winger with a serious concussion and forced him to miss the next game. For the remainder of the series, the Flyers did not retaliate against Chelios until finally, after the series fate was sealed late in Game 6, Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall memorably skated out of his net to attack Chelios in retaliation, which got Hextall suspended for 12 games.  After playing only 53 games in the next season (in which he served as co-captain, with Guy Carbonneau), on June 29, 1990, Chelios was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks with a 2nd-round draft pick for Denis Savard. This trade happened one day after Chelios was accused of fighting with two police officers as they tried to arrest him for urinating in public outside a bar in downtown Madison, Wis., according to a criminal complaint.

Detailed Instructions: Given a scientific question and its correct answer, generate supporting facts for the answer. This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Problem:Question: Is wind power renewable or non renewable? Answer: renewable Solution:","output":"Supporting Fact 1: Wind power is generated from the movement of air due to atmospheric pressure differences. As long as the sun continues to shine and heat the Earth unevenly, causing temperature and pressure differences, wind will continue to blow, making wind power a renewable energy source. Supporting Fact 2: Wind power does not deplete any finite natural resources to produce energy. It harnesses a naturally occurring phenomenon, the wind, which is generated as a result of the Earth's rotation, the heating and cooling of various regions, and the Earth's geography. This continuous process ensures wind power remains a renewable energy source. Supporting Fact 3: Wind turbines, which are used to convert wind energy into electricity, do not emit harmful greenhouse gases during operation. This contributes to the sustainability of wind power as an energy source, as it has a lower environmental impact compared to non-renewable energy sources. Supporting Fact 4: Wind power is a reliable and consistent energy source, as wind patterns remain relatively stable over time. While wind speeds may vary, recent advancements in wind turbine technology have allowed for energy generation at lower wind speeds and with greater efficiency, ensuring the ongoing renewal of wind power as an energy source."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the sentence end? i could not get a bathtub  in my guest bathroom because the","output":"space was too small and the architectural layout posed numerous challenges, resulting in the need to explore alternative solutions to meet the needs of our guests while ensuring aesthetic appeal and functionality. When designing and renovating a guest bathroom, one must take into consideration the available space, layout, and overall purpose of the room. In this particular scenario, installing a traditional bathtub in the guest bathroom was not feasible due to the limited space and the architectural constraints. The small bathroom size, combined with the existing plumbing, electrical systems, and the structural elements of the home, left little room for maneuvering and making significant modifications to accommodate a full-sized bathtub. One possible alternative to a traditional bathtub in a smaller guest bathroom is to consider installing a shower stall instead. A shower stall can be customized to fit the available space and can be designed to include features such as built-in benches, shelves, and grab bars if required. Additionally, a shower stall can be built with frameless glass or other modern materials, which can create the illusion of a larger space and allow more natural light to permeate the room, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal. Another option to utilize the limited space efficiently is to choose a corner bathtub or a smaller, deeper soaking tub. These types of bathtubs can fit into tighter spaces while still providing a comfortable and relaxing bathing experience for guests. Selecting a bathtub with built-in storage or shelving may help to maximize space and allow for the storage of toiletries and other necessary items. In some instances, it may be possible to rearrange the existing layout of the guest bathroom to create more space for a bathtub. This may involve moving plumbing fixtures, electrical outlets, and even walls, but it can be a viable solution if the homeowner is willing to invest the time and money into a more extensive renovation project. Redesigning the bathroom to incorporate a wet room design is another alternative to consider. Wet rooms are fully open-concept bathrooms that combine the shower, bathtub, and other fixtures into one waterproofed area with a single, sloped floor with a drainage system. This design can be space-saving and sleek while offering an easy-to-maintain space for guests. Lastly, the aesthetic aspect should also be taken into account while choosing a suitable solution. Ensuring that the materials, color schemes, and lighting in the guest bathroom are cohesive and appealing will contribute to creating a welcoming and comfortable environment for visitors. In conclusion, while the installation of a traditional bathtub in a smaller guest bathroom may not always be feasible, there are several alternative solutions that can maximize the available space and ensure functionality while maintaining a visually appealing design. Homeowners should explore showers, corner or soaking tubs, changing the room layout, or even considering a wet room design to create a guest bathroom that is inviting, practical, and meets the needs of both the homeowner and their guests."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate the following sentence to Turkish: Joining Schengen means free circulation of goods. Turkish:","output":"Schengen'e katılmak, malların serbest dolaşımını anlamına gelir. These are the steps I took for the translation: 1. I have identified that the user needs me to translate the sentence from English to Turkish. 2. I translated the phrases one by one keeping subject-verb-object order in mind. However, in Turkish, sentence orders can differ based on the emphasis. The subject usually comes before the object and verb. 3. \\"Joining Schengen\\" was translated into \\"Schengen'e katılmak\\". The possessive suffix -e was added to indicate the action towards Schengen.   4. \\"Means\\" was translated into \\"anlamına gelir\\". It is commonly used in Turkish to indicate a causation or equivalence between two things. 5. I translated \\"free circulation of goods\\" into \\"malların serbest dolaşımı\\". \\"Malların serbest dolaşımı\\" directly corresponds to \\"free circulation of goods\\". Turkish uses genitive case (shown by the suffix -ın) to show possession, in this instance, \\"serbest dolaşımı\\" is kind of owned by \\"mallar\\". 6. Thus, combining these smaller translations gave me the final sentence: \\"Schengen'e katılmak, malların serbest dolaşımını anlamına gelir\\" which is the Turkish equivalent of the provided sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Wild Things 2 Movie plot: Brittney Havers (Susan Ward), a South Florida high school senior, lives with her wealthy stepfather, Niles Dunlap (Anthony John Denison), after her mother ran her car off the road in \\"Gator Alley\\" and was presumably eaten by alligators a year earlier. When Dunlap is killed in a private plane crash, his will calls for Brittney to receive a small stipend until she finishes college, after which she will receive only 25,000 a year for life from the estate. The rest of Dunlap's assets, totaling 70 million, are to be left to a corporate trust, unless a blood heir can be found. Brittney's brash, relatively poor classmate Maya (Leila Arcieri) suddenly claims to be Dunlap's illegitimate daughter as the result of her mother's extramarital affair. She is ordered by a judge to submit to a DNA test, the result of which proves she is Dunlap's child. At the Dunlap home, Brittney hears a noise on her way to the wine cellar but it turns out to just be rats. Suddenly Maya appears and the girls reveal they are lovers before being joined by Dr. Julian Haynes (Joe Michael Burke), who had arranged the DNA test. The trio are in cahoots, running a scam to secure and share Dunlap's fortune. Insurance investigator Terence Bridge (Isaiah Washington), investigating the circumstances of the plane crash, finds out from Dunlap's medical records that Dunlap had scarlet fever as a child, one of the side effects of which can be sterility, and asks Dr. Haynes how Dunlap could have fathered a child. Dr. Haynes gets nervous about the plot unraveling and contacts Maya. He agrees to meet her and Brittney that night at the docks, where Maya shoots him. The two girls dispose of his body in Gator Alley. After Bridge learns the entire affair was planned, he shows up at the Dunlap home and demands half the money in return for not going to the police. Brittney, refusing to give up any of the money, gets a gun and points it at Bridge, but instead kills Maya. She tells Bridge that he has to earn his half. He loads Maya's body into the trunk of his car... My question: Do You think Brittany Kills her mother? A:","output":"Based on the plot summary provided, it is unclear whether Brittney is directly responsible for her mother's death. However, given her manipulative and cunning nature, as evidenced by her involvement in the elaborate scam to secure and share Niles Dunlap's fortune, it is not out of the realm of possibility that Brittney had a hand in her mother's demise. Brittney's mother died under mysterious circumstances, with her car running off the road in \\"Gator Alley\\" and her body never being found. This leaves the door open for speculation regarding her death. The absence of concrete evidence regarding the mother's death provides an opportunity for the character's backstory to be further explored, potentially revealing that Brittney had a role in orchestrating the incident to benefit from her stepfather's wealth. As a movie director, you can decide whether you'd like to incorporate this aspect into the story, perhaps as a twist or a means to further demonstrate Brittney's cunning and immoral character. Considering her calculated actions displayed in the plot summary and her willingness to betray her lover Maya by killing her to protect the money, it would not be entirely surprising for the audience to learn that Brittney had played a part in her mother's death, solidifying her ruthless and self-serving nature. In conclusion, while the provided plot does not explicitly state that Brittney kills her mother, her character's deceptive and manipulative traits suggest that she might be capable of doing so. It could serve as an interesting development in the storyline if, as the director, you choose to explore this aspect further."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is friends with the neighbor's son?, using the article: On October 9, 2006, Kristi Rey and her husband Daniel are killed by her demon-possessed sister Katie, who then abducts Kristi's one-year-old son, Hunter. Text states that Katie and Hunter's whereabouts remained unknown. Five years later, in November 2011, Alex Nelson lives in a wealthy suburb of Henderson, Nevada with her father Doug, mother Holly, and little brother Wyatt. When their new neighbor falls ill and is taken to the hospital, her son, Robbie, is left in the care of the family. One night while Alex is sleeping, her boyfriend Ben's computer starts recording her laptop webcam, and he sees Robbie getting into the bed with her. The next day, Wyatt tells Alex about Robbie's friend, Toby. After strange events happen, Alex and Ben set up cameras all over the house. On the third night, the strange happenings escalate until one day, Alex finds a trail of toys that leads to a closet. She finds Robbie, who says, \\"He doesn't like you watching us,\\" as a chandelier falls and almost kills her., what would be the answer ?","output":"Based on the provided article, it is not explicitly mentioned who is friends with the neighbor's son, Robbie, aside from the mention of Robbie's friend, Toby. The article revolves around the Nelson family, who take care of Robbie after his mother falls ill, and the subsequent strange events happening in their home.  Since the only friend mentioned for Robbie in the article is Toby, it can be inferred that Toby is the main friend of the neighbor's son. However, it is important to note that Toby's identity or nature are not disclosed in the article, raising the possibility of an unseen or supernatural being. The strange events that occur at the Nelson residence suggest that the friendship with Toby might be linked to supernatural happenings. From the context provided, Robbie, the neighbor's son, seems to have a relatively close relationship with the Nelson family, as he is taken into their care for some time. While he may not be friends in the traditional sense with the family members, his interaction with the family could be considered as a friendly relationship. Alex, Wyatt, Doug, and Holly are not specified to be friends of Robbie, but they do have a connection with him since he is temporarily living with them. In conclusion, the available information suggests that Toby is the primary friend of the neighbor's son, Robbie. It is essential to keep in mind that Robbie's relationship with the Nelson family could also be considered as a friendly connection, but the friendship with Toby seems more significant, especially given the strange occurrences surrounding this relationship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Görüşmelerde, diğer konuların yanı sıra Makedon vatandaşlarına yönelik vize kısıtlamalarının hafifletilmesi üzerinde duruldu. Translate this to English?","output":"During the discussions, among other topics, the focus was on easing visa restrictions for Macedonian citizens. In these discussions, numerous subjects were addressed, one of which concerned the alleviation of visa limitations specifically targeting the citizens of Macedonia. These meetings aimed to find potential solutions and compromises in order to make international travel and cooperation more accessible and convenient for Macedonian nationals. By lightening these constraints, it was anticipated that not only would it encourage stronger diplomatic ties, but it would also foster cultural exchange, economic growth, and mutual understanding between the countries involved. Addressing visa restrictions has the potential to bring forth several benefits. For instance, facilitating the visa process can significantly reduce the time and effort necessary for applicants to receive their permits, thus enabling them to attend to personal or professional matters abroad more expeditiously. In turn, this may result in a surge in demand for reciprocal tourism, which could positively impact the revenue of both countries. Furthermore, by simplifying visa requirements and reducing restrictions, countries can attract more international students, investors, and skilled professionals. This exchange affects several aspects of society, from contributing to the academic sphere to stimulating the local economy and innovation. In particular, developing countries stand to benefit greatly from such interactions as they can gain access to essential knowledge and technological resources that can be employed in their internal development processes. The essence of these discussions aligns with the broader global trend of relaxing visa restrictions in recent years. Many nations acknowledge the importance of cultivating stronger international relationships and recognize the significance of fostering global ties through trade, education, and cultural exchanges. As a result, more dialogues are emerging, focused on removing hindrances to international mobility and opening the door to increased opportunities for collaboration. In conclusion, addressing and easing visa restrictions for Macedonian citizens were key topics highlighted during the discussions. This move holds the potential to enhance diplomatic relations and foster mutual growth by encouraging interactions between countries. Improving visa accessibility can create a plethora of advantages, most notably breaking down international barriers and enabling increased collaboration in various sectors of society."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A given name (also known as a personal name, Christian name, first name, or forename) is a part of a person's full nomenclature. It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family.  - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium.  - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms.  - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there.  - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF.  - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s.  - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language.   - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name .  - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit).  - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere.   - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable.  - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels.  - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language. It includes norms of spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation.    What is the relationship between 'strauss' and 'person'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between \\"Strauss\\" and \\"person\\" is that Strauss is a common Germanic surname, which refers to a family name that is added to a person's given name to form their full name. The surname Strauss serves to identify and distinguish individuals from other members of their family or community with whom they share common ancestry or lineage.  In this context, the word \\"person\\" denotes an individual human being with their own unique identity, characterized by their given and family names, among other attributes. A person's full nomenclature, containing both their given name and surname, helps to differentiate them from other individuals within their family or social group. Moreover, the surname Strauss has multiple possible origins. It may have originated from the word \\"struz\\" or \\"strutz,\\" meaning \\"ostrich\\" in North-German. The symbol of an ostrich has historical significance in certain regions, as illustrated by the example of the overlord of Gröna, who used the image of an ostrich as his symbol, and it can still be seen on the thousand-year-old church bell of the town.  Another possible origin for the Strauss surname comes from Jewish families residing in the Judengasse of medieval Frankfurt. Families were known by the names of the houses they lived in, and one such example is the \\"Haus Strauss,\\" which displayed an image of an ostrich on its façade. Some Jewish families later chose to adopt the Strauss surname during the time when Napoleon made surnames obligatory for tax purposes in 1808. In summary, the relationship between \\"Strauss\\" and \\"person\\" lies in the fact that Strauss functions as a surname, connecting an individual to their family heritage and history, and acting as a unique identifier within their social circle or community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Thus, the complete sentence is: The computer was fixed by Katrina instead of Jennifer since Katrina has a degree in information technology. The reason for choosing option (A) is because it provides an explanation about why Katrina was preferred for fixing the computer over Jennifer. By mentioning that Katrina has a degree in information technology, it is implied that she has the necessary knowledge, skills, and expertise in dealing with computer-related issues. On the other hand, choosing option (B) wouldn't make much sense in the context provided, as it states that Jennifer has a degree in information technology. This information would not explain why Katrina fixed the computer instead of Jennifer, as both would seem equally qualified to handle the task. When constructing sentences and making choices among options, it is essential to consider the flow of information and consistent logic behind the statements being made. In this case, option (A) offers a clear and consistent explanation for the choice made to have Katrina perform the task of fixing the computer."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task your given two statements in Estonian.

What is the best way to: make a fun spiked fondue","output":"To make a fun spiked fondue, a combination of delicious ingredients and an alcoholic beverage will be necessary. Here is the step-by-step process to create this exciting dish: Step 1: Choose the type of fondue Decide whether you want to create a savory (cheese-based) or sweet (chocolate-based) fondue. The choice should be based on the preference of the people who would be consuming it. Step 2: Assemble the ingredients Once the type of fondue is chosen, gather the necessary ingredients to prepare it. For savory cheese fondue: - 200g Gruyère cheese - 200g Emmental cheese - 1 garlic clove - 300ml dry white wine - 1 tsp lemon juice - 1 tbsp cornstarch - 2 tbsp kirsch (cherry brandy) - Freshly ground black pepper - Freshly grated nutmeg - Fresh French bread or vegetables, cut into bite-sized pieces For sweet chocolate fondue: - 200g dark or milk chocolate - 100ml heavy cream - 1 tbsp unsalted butter - 2 tbsp liqueur (like amaretto, Frangelico, Grand Marnier, or rum) - Fruit, cookies, marshmallows, or other desired items for dipping Step 3: Prepare the fondue pot Rub the inside of a ceramic or enameled fondue pot with the garlic clove to add flavor. You can skip this step for the sweet chocolate fondue. Step 4: Mix and heat the ingredients For cheese fondue, combine the grated cheeses, wine, and lemon juice in the fondue pot. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the cheese is fully melted and the mixture is smooth. For chocolate fondue, heat the cream and butter in the fondue pot over low heat. Once the butter is melted and the cream is heated, add the chocolate pieces and stir until melted and smooth. Step 5: Add the alcohol In both cases, mix the cornstarch with the chosen alcohol (kirsch for cheese, liqueur for chocolate) to create a slurry. Slowly stir this mixture into the melted cheese or chocolate in the fondue pot, continuing to heat until the mixture is thickened. Step 6: Season and serve For cheese fondue, season with freshly ground black pepper and freshly grated nutmeg to taste. Place the fondue pot on a burner at the table and serve with French bread or vegetables for dipping. For chocolate fondue, transfer the melted chocolate mixture to a warm fondue pot. Serve with an assortment of fruits, cookies, marshmallows, or other desired items for dipping. Enjoy the fun spiked fondue with friends and family, ensuring that each person has a fondue fork for dipping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve for \\"t\\" in the equation -29*t = -370 + 80 , follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the right side of the equation The right side of the equation has two numbers, -370 and 80. Add these together to simplify this side: -370 + 80 = -290 So, the equation now becomes -29*t = -290 Step 2: Solve for \\"t\\" Currently, \\"t\\" is being multiplied by -29 in the equation above. To solve for \\"t\\", you need to get it alone on one side of the equation.  To do this, you can divide both sides of the equation by -29. Division is the inverse operation to multiplication, so it will effectively cancel out the -29 being multiplied by \\"t\\" on the left side: (-29*t)/-29 = -290/-29 This simplifies to: t = 10 So, based on the original equation, \\"t\\" equals 10."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first powered, controlled aeroplane to fly, the Wright Flyer, used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation. While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a similar unbraced or cantilever monoplane wing. Improved structural techniques, better materials and the quest for greater speed made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s.  - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX.  - Hawker Aircraft Limited was a British aircraft manufacturer responsible for some of the most famous products in British aviation history.  - Sir Sydney Camm, CBE, FRAeS (5 August 189312 March 1966) was an English aeronautical engineer who contributed to many Hawker aircraft designs, from the biplanes of the 1920s to jet fighters. One particularly notable aircraft he designed is the Hawker Hurricane fighter.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - The Hawker Hart was a British two-seater biplane light bomber aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was designed during the 1920s by Sydney Camm and manufactured by Hawker Aircraft. The Hart was a prominent British aircraft in the inter-war period, but was obsolete and already side-lined for newer monoplane aircraft designs by the start of the Second World War, playing only minor roles in the conflict before being retired.  - The Hawker Fury was a British biplane fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force in the 1930s . It was a fast , agile aircraft , and holds the distinction of being the first interceptor in RAF service to be capable of more than 200 MPH . The Fury is the fighter counterpart to the Hawker Hart light bomber .  - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.
