There is a large separation between the two sides of the cerebrum called the longitudinal fissure. It separates the cerebrum into two distinct halves, a right and left cerebral hemisphere.

Please answer the following question: Jeffrey is an avid grower of plants and he currently has some daisies and roses in his bedroom. Jeffrey's friend Robert gives Jeffrey a bottle of gibberellins one day and tells Jeffrey to pour some of the bottle onto the daisies. Jeffrey doesn't question this, because he is very trusting of his friend Robert, and pours the gibberellins onto the daisies, but not onto the roses.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which plants will grow slower, the daisies or the roses?  Hint: Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open. A:","output":"Given the information provided, the roses will grow slower than the daisies. This is because Jeffrey applied gibberellins, a hormone responsible for promoting plant growth, to the daisies but not to the roses. Since gibberellins cause plants to have longer stems and promote overall growth, the daisies that received this hormone treatment will grow at a faster rate compared to the roses, which did not receive any gibberellin treatment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the last name of Holst's pupil?  Holst's absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic \\"sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass\\", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; \\"He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose\\". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: \\"the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far\\". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance \\"a spirit of practical comradeship ... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible\\".

Lake: Although you may find pebbles near the shoreline of a lake, it is less likely that they have been walked on compared to pebbles in a playground. Lakeshores are not as frequently trafficked as playgrounds, especially in areas where pebbles are submerged in water. 2. Playground: Playgrounds are ideal locations for finding pebbles that have been walked on. Many playgrounds have surface materials like pebbles, sand, or wood chips that provide a softer cushion for children at play. As children walk and play in these areas, the pebbles are naturally subjected to foot traffic, making it a suitable environment to find pebbles that have been walked on. 3. Pond: Similar to lakes, pebbles can be found near the edges of ponds. However, ponds are also not as frequently visited as playgrounds. The likelihood of finding pebbles that have been walked on would be relatively lower compared to playgrounds. 4. Aquarium: Pebbles can certainly be found in aquariums, whether in exhibits or as part of the decorative material in fish tanks. However, it is very unlikely that these pebbles would have been walked on by humans, as they are either submerged in water or enclosed in an exhibit. 5. Stucco: Stucco refers to a material made from cement, sand, and lime, applied to exterior and interior walls for a textured finish. Although stucco may have a rough, pebble-like appearance, it actually doesn't contain actual pebbles and wouldn't be a place where you can find a pebble that has been walked on. In conclusion, playgrounds are the most suitable option for finding a pebble that has been walked on due to the typical use of pebbles in their surface materials and the high amounts of foot traffic they receive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write the answer: What is the highest mountain on Antarctica?","output":"The highest mountain on Antarctica is Mount Vinson, also known as Vinson Massif. It is the tallest peak on the continent and is situated in the Sentinel Range, a part of the Ellsworth Mountains, located in West Antarctica near the Ronne Ice Shelf. The mountain takes its name from Carl Vinson, a US Congressman from Georgia who was instrumental in supporting and funding scientific research and exploration in Antarctica during his tenure from 1914 to 1961. Mount Vinson has an elevation of 16,050 feet (4,892 meters), making it one of the highest peaks in the Seven Summits, a collection of the tallest mountains on each of the seven continents. The mountain was first discovered and photographed in 1958 during the US Navy's mapping operation, and it was initially mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1961. Notably, Mount Vinson's first recorded ascent took place on December 18, 1966, by a team led by Nicholas B. Clinch. Climbing Mount Vinson is a challenging endeavor on account of the remote location and the harsh Antarctic weather conditions, which include extreme cold temperatures, strong winds, and potential storms. The climbing season typically runs from November to January, corresponding to the Antarctic summer when the conditions are relatively more favorable for mountaineers. Access to the mountain usually involves chartering a specialized plane to transport the climbers and their equipment from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Union Glacier Camp in Antarctica, followed by another flight to Mount Vinson base camp. While ascending Mount Vinson, climbers need to be well accustomed to using crampons, ice axes, and other necessary equipment, as they will traverse through glaciers, ice-falls, and crevasses. Additionally, they must be physically fit and acclimatize to the altitude to reduce the risk of acute mountain sickness or other altitude-related issues. Due to the factors mentioned above, climbing Mount Vinson is generally reserved for experienced mountaineers. In terms of ecological importance, the region surrounding the Ellsworth Mountains is subject to strict environmental regulations to preserve the fragile ecosystem and the pristine condition of the Antarctic continent.

Definition: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vaccines in the event of an outbreak. .

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which camp experienced warmer weather?  Two teams of scientists were in Antarctica to study the weather. Camp Alpha was located in East Antarctica, while camp Omega was situated in West Antarctica.  Hint: East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded. The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the information provided, the camp that experienced warmer weather was Camp Omega, which was situated in West Antarctica. The hint indicates that East Antarctica, where Camp Alpha was located, is colder than West Antarctica due to its higher elevation and weather fronts rarely penetrating far into the continent."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who is discovered by a priest? is inside the article: The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, New Hampshire. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location. Only Adam and Emily follow the redneck; Sally is sent back to their campsite, while Dick had left earlier, having met Debra., can you guess it ?

With the help of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880.[dubious – discuss] On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. Besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical, they had a very short lifetime. Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' and obtained British Patent 4933 in 1880. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity.

First, we have a math problem with lots of numbers and the letter 'g'. Our job is to find out what number 'g' is. The problem looks like this: -612 * g - 1011 * g - 7052 = 10801 The first thing we're going to do is combine the 'g' parts. That's like saying if you have some apples and I give you more apples, how many apples do you have? So, -612 * g and -1011 * g are our apple groups. Let's add those together: -612 - 1011 is -1623 Now, our problem is easier and looks like this: -1623 * g - 7052 = 10801 Next, we want to get 'g' by itself, so we need to get rid of that pesky -7052. It's like taking away some toys so we can see the ones we want clearly. To do this, we add 7052 to both sides of the '=' sign (because if we do it to one side, we have to do it to the other to keep things fair): -1623 * g = 10801 + 7052 Now our problem is: -1623 * g = 17853 We're almost there! We just need to find out what 'g' is. To do this, we need to get rid of the -1623 that's multiplying 'g'. So, we'll do the opposite, which is dividing both sides by -1623. g = 17853 / -1623 And we get: g = -11 So, after solving our math problem like a story, we find out that 'g' is -11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 7 July 2011 , Russell was traded for Kris Russell on the Columbus Blue Jackets and joined his brother Michael Blunden with the organization Blue Jackets .","output":"Though these sentences convey similar information, they are not entirely accurate in their descriptions and contain some discrepancies. Here is a detailed comparison of the two sentences: Sentence 1: \\"On July 7, 2011, Russell was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets for Michael Blunden. He joined his brother Kris Russell with the Blue Jackets organization.\\" This sentence properly states that Russell (we assume it's a player with the last name \\"Russell\\") was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets for another player, Michael Blunden, on July 7, 2011. It also mentions that when he joined the Blue Jackets organization, he began playing alongside his brother, Kris Russell. The sentence provides details about the trade and the relationship between the two Russell brothers. Sentence 2: \\"On 7 July 2011, Russell was traded for Kris Russell on the Columbus Blue Jackets and joined his brother Michael Blunden with the organization Blue Jackets.\\" The second sentence is somewhat confusing and contains a few inaccuracies. First, it states that Russell was traded for Kris Russell on the Columbus Blue Jackets. This is incorrect, as, in the first sentence, we know that Russell was traded for Michael Blunden, not Kris Russell. Second, it says that he joined his brother Michael Blunden with the organization Blue Jackets. While it is true that Russell joined the Blue Jackets, Michael Blunden is not his brother — as the first sentence explains, Kris Russell is his brother. To maintain accurate information, it is important to address these discrepancies. The second sentence should be rewritten as follows: \\"On 7 July 2011, Russell was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets for Michael Blunden and joined his brother Kris Russell within the Blue Jackets organization.\\" This revised sentence more accurately reflects the information presented in the first sentence while maintaining a similar structure to the original second sentence.

We have: 12*y + 13 + 33 = -14 First, let's add the two numbers we know: 13 + 33 = 46. Then our equation will look like: 12*y + 46 = -14 Now, we want to get \\"y\\" alone on one side.

To do this, we will subtract 46 from both sides of the equation: 12*y + 46 - 46 = -14 - 46 That means: 12*y = -60 Now, we want to know what \\"y\\" is equal to. Since 12 times \\"y\\" equals -60, we can divide -60 by 12 to find out what \\"y\\" is. So the last step is: y = -60 / 12 Now, if we do the division we get: y = -5 So the answer is: y = -5.

Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him 2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the Stanley Cup. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, Oprah will have him on her show. Pitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair. Darren begins to play well but then gets suspended for the next two games after beating up Le Cocq, and hitting Coach Cherkov with a hockey puck. Later, Pitka has dinner with Jane. He tries to kiss her, only to hear a ding on his chastity belt. Upset when he tells her their love cannot be, she runs out. Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games, Coach Cherkoff berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin. He is only slightly injured from hitting the chastity belt but Pitka moans and drops to the ground.

Singing aloud will not just lift the spirits---it's good for your physical health as well. Filling the lungs with air, increasing the heart rate and getting blood pumping round the body faster can all help our physical health. For the past few years Heart Research UK has been Funding a Christmas campaign aimed at getting people singing, simply for the benefit it can bring. The organizer of the campaign says singing is a safe, simple and social activity that everyone can enjoy. \\"Singing is linked to long life, stress reduction, and general health protection. It also brings a great amount of happiness. It is impossible to sing well with a long face because it affects your pitch .\\" Professor Graham Welch, who leads the International Music Education Research Centre at the University of London, has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of singing. He says that singing is a form of exercise. It means we're also having a strong aerobic activity when we're singing, which results in increasing the feeling of pleasure while decreasing that of stress. \\"And communal singing--like in a singing group, a church service or even a singsong in the pub--helps improve our sense of self-respect. It increases our sense of satisfaction with ourselves, a greater sense of feeling included. \\" Helen Astrid, a singing teacher, also sees the great effects that singing brings. \\"It lifts us up on a spiritual level, it helps our self-respect, and it's great for all ages from small kids to grannies--you can have a good sing and _ .\\" But she warns people not to have too many beers or glasses of wine, though a glass may help them gather courage before taking to the stage during the holidays.

When calculating your income for you debt-to-income ratio, use the amount of money you make before taxes and not what you make after taxes are taken out. Example: If the person in the example continued from above makes 39,000 on a yearly basis before taxes, or 750 a week before taxes, one of these figures should be used instead of a net income figure. Divide your annual gross income by 12 to determine your average monthly income.  If you do not know your annual gross income, take your weekly income and multiply it by the number of payments you receive in a year. If you get paid every other week, this would be 26 payments; for payment that occurs weekly, this would be 52 payments. This will give you your annual income, and you can divide this number by 12 to determine your monthly income. Alternatively, you can take your weekly payment and multiply it by 4.3 or multiply your bi-weekly pay by 2.15 to determine your rough monthly income. Example: If a person's yearly gross income is 39,000, then: 39000 / 12 = 3250  If a person's weekly gross income is 750, then: 750 * 52 = 39000; 39000 / 12 = 3250 Alternatively, if a person's weekly gross income is 750, then: 750 * 4.3 = 3225 If you received commissions, bonuses, tips, overtime, or money from other sources, like alimony, rental income, investment income, pension, disability, or child support, add that money to your monthly income. Example: If you receive investment income of roughly 200 each month, add that to your monthly gross income of 3250, giving you a total income of 3450. Summary:","output":"To find out how much money you make each month, you need to use the amount you make before taxes are taken out. You can do this in a few ways: 1. If you know your yearly income before taxes, divide that number by 12. 2. If you know your weekly income before taxes, multiply that by the number of payments you get in a year, and then divide that number by 12. 3. If you know your weekly income before taxes, multiply that by 4.3 for a rough monthly income. Don't forget to add any extra money you get, like from investments or gifts, to your monthly income.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.

Beyoncé, Jay Z, Solange Knowles speak out on elevator fight video: 'We love each other and, above all, we are family' Jay Z and Solange have made nice — more than a week after she opened a can of whoop-ass on the Brooklyn-born rapper. Breaking their silence over the videotaped elevator attack for the first time, Jay Z, Beyoncé and Solange Knowles issued a statement on Thursday, saying the family drama has been ironed out. “As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it,” the trio said in a statement to The Associated Press. “Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family.” Rachel Roy, seen at the May 5 Met Gala in New York, was apparently getting too close to Jay Z — prompting Solange's attack. The statement does not address what led to the punching and kicking at the Standard Hotel following a Met Gala after-party in Chelsea’s Boom Boom Room. Sources have told the Daily News the beatdown was triggered by Solange taking offense to designer Rachel Roy getting “too close” to the 44-year-old Jay Z. Beyoncé’s younger sibling didn’t like the way Roy was hovering over the rap mogul — and took her feelings out on him, the sources said. “Rachel is a little too close to Jay Z,” a source told The News. “Solange doesn’t like it, and Beyoncé doesn't like it.” Solange, 27, was drunk and belligerent at the time, the sources added. But the family statement dismissed the claims. “The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false,” the statement read. “At the end of the day, families have problems and we’re no different. We love each other and, above all, we are family. We’ve put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.” Signs that the family had healed its rift came earlier Thursday when Solange posted two childhood photos of Beyoncé on her Instagram page. Solange had previously taken down nearly all photos of her 32-year-old sister. The Standard Hotel fired the worker responsible for leaking the shocking video. In a statement, hotel officials said they were “pursuing all available civil and criminal remedies.” Beyoncé, Jay Z and Solange Knowles released this statement: As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident.

At two stories, the building is tall in its proportion and incorporates elements from both early American and Victorian styles, which were common in academic buildings built during this period.Architectural historian S. Allen Chambers described Literary Hall as an anomaly because the basic design and fenestration patterns, which invoke early Federal and Greek Revival design elements, are adorned with details more characteristic of the Victorian era.According to architectural historian Michael J.

They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862.  Guess a valid title for it!

Due to where they like to feed, manatees are vulnerable to injuries from boat propellers. If speed zones requiring boats to maintain a low speed are placed in areas where manatees are known to congregate, which will most likely occur?  * less water pollution in manatee habitats will occur. * manatees will seek alternate food sources. * new manatee predators will surface. * manatee populations will increase.","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given situation and the possible outcomes. We need to consider the effects of placing speed zones in areas where manatees congregate. The main concern is the impact of boat propellers on manatees. Step 2: Evaluate each option based on the given situation. 1. Less water pollution in manatee habitats will occur: Although reduced boat speeds may lead to less water disturbance, there is no direct correlation between the speed limits and reduced water pollution in this context. So, this option is less likely to occur. 2. Manatees will seek alternate food sources: The question states that manatees feed on sea grasses in brackish water, so their food source is not tied to boat traffic. Consequently, implementing speed limits is unlikely to push manatees to seek alternate food sources. This option is less likely to occur. 3. New manatee predators will surface: Since there is no mention of the relationship between manatee predators and boat speeds, this option also seems unrelated to the implementation of speed limits. This option is less likely to occur. 4. Manatee populations will increase: By implementing speed zones, boats will be required to maintain lower speeds, which may decrease the chances of manatees being injured or killed by propellers. As a result, a reduction in manatee deaths could potentially lead to an increase in their population. Step 3: Choose the most likely outcome based on the evaluation. Based on the evaluation of all options, I conclude that the most likely outcome if speed zones are placed in areas where manatees congregate is: * Manatee populations will increase."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Winn is still listed on the certificate as the registered owner, and under Georgia law, the certificate is prima facie evidence of the facts appearing on it. Ga. Code Ann. Sec. 40-3-25(c) (1985). Although our reading of the Georgia statutes yields the conclusion that ownership of the Buick did not pass to the dealership or to H & L since the certificate of title was not properly assigned, it appears that Georgia courts interpreting the same statutes would reach a different conclusion. See, e.g., American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co., 149 Ga. App. 280, 253 S.E.2d 825 (1979); Mote v. Mote, 134 Ga. App. 668, 215 S.E.2d 487 (1975) (<HOLDING>).

When you build your house, be sure to use cobblestone (not wood) so that it will be ghast-proof. Make sure you have an iron door with a lever or button inside and out. Don't bother placing a bed, because if you try to sleep in it, it will explode. You may need to clear out the pigmen and blazes - just remember that all of the pigmen will attack you if you injure just one - and make sure to destroy all blaze spawners (with a pickaxe).  The Nether Fortress does make a quite decent house; there are hiding places inside mountains and rooms deep inside where you can hide from ghasts and stuff. They are very decent places to live and contain plenty of bricks and staircases, blazes for blaze rods for potion making, treasure chests, and a Nether-wart farm. What else could a Minecrafter ask for? You can get rotten flesh from zombie pigmen (climb a tower before fighting them, because they will swarm at you). Rotten flesh may give you the hunger effect, but you can drink milk (if you were able to get a cow through the portal) or bring a milk bucket before entering the nether. You can also drink a potion to stop the effect. If you bring bowls, you can make mushroom stew in your inventory crafting grid from the mushrooms found in the Nether. There are no other food sources in the Nether unless you brought trees or seeds with you. If you bring trees or seeds, you should also bring dirt. Yes, it's a no-brainer because the materials needed are mostly in the Nether to make this, and so are the ingredients: blaze rods, ghast tears, etc. You can also make splash potions for pesky pigmen packs that you have started a fight with. Either way, it’s essential unless you want to easily die after eating rotten flesh.

Article: Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated  since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well. Question: What type of writing does this passage belong to?

What Remains of Us (2004) - Directed by François Prévost and Hugo Latulippe, this Canadian documentary film is centered around Kalsang Dolma, a Tibetan woman living in Canada. She secretly brings a videotaped message from the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, to his oppressed people in Tibet. The film captures the reactions and emotions of Tibetans living under the Chinese occupation as they view the message of hope and guidance.  \\"What Remains of Us\\" can be classified within the sub-genre of political documentaries, as it touches on the themes of political oppression, human rights, and the struggle for Tibetan freedom. The documentary exposes the harsh realities of life under Chinese rule and promotes cultural preservation amidst adversity. Its approach to storytelling falls under the category of a personal documentary, showcasing the experiences of Kalsang Dolma and her journey as a bridge between the exiled Dalai Lama and his followers in Tibet. 2. Without the King (2007) - Directed by Michael Skolnik, \\"Without the King\\" is a documentary that presents an inside look into the African kingdom of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland. The film primarily focuses on the nation's absolute monarch, King Mswati III, and his family's extravagance while the majority of the population lives in poverty and suffers from the world's highest HIV/AIDS rate. This documentary can be classified within the sub-genre of socio-cultural and political documentaries, as it explores the contrast between the royal family's opulence and the suffering of the Swazi people. The film also delves into themes such as wealth inequality, human rights abuses, and the need for political reform. As \\"Without the King\\" documents the lives of the royal family and those affected by their rule, it falls under the category of a character-driven documentary, with personal stories interweaved with the broader political issues. In conclusion, both \\"What Remains of Us\\" and \\"Without the King\\" are documentary films that uncover political and socio-cultural themes through personal narratives, exploring the realities of the subjects documented and the challenges they face. While both documentaries might be centered around different geographical regions and socio-political contexts, their common ground lies in shedding light on the hardships and resilience of the respective communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 2*u = -168 - 167 + 319 for u.","output":"Alright little buddy, let me help you with the math problem. First, let's simplify the numbers on the right side of the equation. We have: -168 - 167 + 319 Now, let's add the numbers together: -168 - 167 = -335 -335 + 319 = -16 So now the equation looks like this: 2 * u = -16 Now, we need to find out what number (u) multiplied by 2 will give us -16. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2. (2 * u) / 2 = -16 / 2 The 2's on the left side cancel each other out and we are left with: u = -8 So, the answer is u = -8.

Continue crusading for equality. 4. Discriminate due to gender age or race. Q: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

After finishing their blog post, the author will likely continue crusading for equality. This is because the author demonstrates a strong understanding of the severity and ubiquity of discrimination in various forms, and a genuine concern for addressing the problem. In the passage, the author acknowledges that they will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of discrimination. Yet, they are determined to contribute to raising awareness about the issue. As such, it stands to reason that they will continue to be an advocate for equality moving forward. Moreover, the author's intent to create practical, implementable steps for people to take in order to combat discrimination also suggests that they are invested in creating real change. By focusing on actions that individuals can take, the author is aiming to empower others to join them in the fight for equal treatment. In sum, the determination to raise awareness, work on actionable steps, and encourage others to participate in the struggle against discrimination all point to the author's continued crusade for equality in all its forms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - Belfast is the capital and largest city of Northern Ireland, the second largest on the island of Ireland, and the heart of the tenth largest Primary Urban Area in the United Kingdom. On the River Lagan, it had a population of 286,000 at the 2011 census and 333,871 after the 2015 council reform. Belfast was granted city status in 1888.  - A prison escape (or prison break) is the act of an inmate leaving prison through unofficial or illegal ways. Normally, when this occurs, an effort is made on the part of authorities to recapture them and return them to their original detainers. Escaping from prison is also a criminal offense in some countries, e.g. United States and Russia, and it is highly likely to result in time being added to the inmate's sentence, as well as the inmate being placed under increased security. Aggravating factors include whether or not violence was used.  - The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA or PIRA) was an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and to bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland. It was the biggest and most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It saw itself as the successor to the original IRA and called itself simply the Irish Republican Army, or \\"Óglaigh na hÉireann\\" in Irish. It was also widely referred to as such by others.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - The Northern Ireland Assembly (Ulster Scots: \\"Norlin Airlan Assemblie\\") is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast.  - The Maze Prison escape (known to Irish republicans as the Great Escape) took place on 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered to be one of the most escape-proof prisons in Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during the Troubles. In the biggest prison escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a heart attack as a result of the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into the escape placed most of the blame onto prison staff, who in turn blamed the escape on political interference in the running of the prison.  - The River Lagan (Ulster Scots: \\"Lagan Wattèr\\") is a major river in Northern Ireland which runs 53.5 miles (86 km) from the Slieve Croob mountain in County Down to Belfast where it enters Belfast Lough, an inlet of the Irish Sea. The River Lagan forms much of the border between County Antrim and County Down in the east of Ulster. It rises as a tiny, fast-moving stream near to the summit of Slieve Croob; Transmitter Road runs nearby. From here it continues on its journey to Belfast through Dromara, Donaghcloney and Dromore. On the lower slopes of the mountain, it is joined by another branch from Legananny (Cratlieve) Mountain, just opposite Slieve Croob. At Dromara, about four miles from its source, its height above the sea is 390 ft (119m). As the river continues on its journey to Belfast, it turns east to Magheralin into a broad plain between the plateaus of Antrim and Down.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as a \\"guerrilla war\\" or \\"low-level war\\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday \\"Belfast\\" Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mainly took place in Northern Ireland, violence spilled over at times into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England and mainland Europe.  - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic.

Context: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group would less likely engage in visually intensive works, group A or group B?  Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

The text itself seems to be part of a larger narrative or article discussing ethnic representation in the government under Albanian administration. It mentions certain invitations to a Serbian and a Turk for joining a committee, which were supposedly cancelled by someone named Holkeri. This cancellation was apparently due to the justification that a government under Albanian rule could not be represented solely by members of ethnic minorities.

Here is a news article: But this weekend's shopping spree provides another important lesson. It tells us how we shop. The key storyline of Thanksgiving 2011 is not about mobs lining up at midnight. It's about buyers leaning back with iPads after the big family dinner. It's about the continuing rise of online, and especially mobile, shopping.      Here's what the numbers don't tell us: anything useful about the recovery. Are shoppers really more confident about the economy? Or are they just desperate for deals? We don't know. The last time shoppers spent this much over Thanksgiving were the dark days of 2008. Afterwards, holiday sales promptly fell off a cliff.      Here's what the Black Friday/Cyber Monday numbers tell us: Americans just spent a lot of money. The National Retail Federation estimates that Americans spent a record 52 billion dollars through Sunday. That doesn't include the online retail haul from Cyber Monday. Online sales on Cyber Monday eclipsed last year's record of 1.03 billion, according to Coremetrics.      This year's Thanksgiving sales don't tell us anything about the health of our economy. But they do show us something about its digital future.      Consider these numbers. On Black Friday, in-store purchases increased about 7%. But online, Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday sales jumped by 39%, 24% and 33%, respectively.            Growth in mobile was even more explosive. PayPal reported that payments via phones and tablets were up more than 500% on each of the three major shopping days. IBM said mobile devices were responsible for 9.8% percent of online Black Friday sales, up from 3.2% a year ago.            So no, mobile hasn't replaced good old fashioned Black Friday chaos. It hasn't even replaced regular old web browsing. But it's arrived as a key piece of holiday commerce. And it's only going to get bigger.      That has implications across business. For retail, it means adjusting to customers who are harder to lure and more discriminating. More people are doing their shopping while sitting with family on Thanksgiving proper rather than waiting for a trip to the mall the next day. And when they do make that trip to Macy's or Target, shoppers can browse the aisles phone in hand, comparing prices. For Silicon Valley, it underscores the need to win the mobile arms race. In the end, the fates of the tech's giants are tied to our shopping habits. Google and Facebook live off ads. Amazon lives off eCommerce. And as more and more Americans shop on phones and tablets, owning those spaces will be ever more crucial to their business models. It's why Amazon has the Kindle Fire, and why Facebook is working on a new phone with HTC.      Thanksgiving sales won't tell us whether the economy is about to take off. But they do tell us what we've become as a shopping culture. More than that, as the biggest consumer nation on earth, it tells us where we're headed as a business culture. Our future is on our phones. And the companies that learn to compete in that environment are the companies that will survive.      > ||||| Article Excerpt      Online sales on Cyber Monday rose to a record 1.25 billion as consumers continued to make the Web an integral part of their holiday shopping.      The 1.25 billion is the heaviest online commerce day ever, according to research firm comScore Inc., and represents a 22% rise from last year's Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday last year saw then-record online purchases totalling 1.03 billion.      Meanwhile, for some retailers it is no longer just Cyber Monday—it is Cyber Week. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Amazon.com ... ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The key takeaway from the Thanksgiving weekend sales in 2011 was the significant growth in online and mobile shopping. Though in-store purchases increased by 7% on Black Friday, online sales on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday registered increases of 39%, 24%, and 33% respectively. Mobile payments through phones and tablets also saw a remarkable growth of over 500% on each of these shopping days.

US markets rose during her speech at the Economic Club of New York. Her tone was similar to the Fed's statement in mid-March, when the central bank made no change to rates and guided expectations towards a slower pace of increases after December's increase. Ms Yellen repeated her message from earlier public speeches that volatile oil prices and China's slowing growth, along with how soon inflation would reach the Fed's 2% goal, were key factors guiding the Fed towards taking a gradual approach on raising rates. Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign  Exchange, said her caution was not surprising, but stood in contrast to support for rate rises from other Fed speakers in recent days. He added: \\"On balance, [Yellen's] comments do not sound consistent with a looming rate hike in April and leave considerable doubt about whether rates will rise in June. Earlier on Tuesday the head of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, John Williams, said the US economy was doing \\"quite well\\". As she has done in past speeches, Ms Yellen said the market should be open to the possibility of news that boosts confidence. \\"We should not ignore the welcome possibility that economic conditions could turn out to be more favourable than we now expect,\\" she said. The audience in New York laughed when Ms Yellen was asked how long the Fed expected to take to reach \\"normal\\" interest rates and whether she felt the market had failed to understand the bank's plan. The Fed chief has been trying to reassure markets of its \\"gradual\\" plan since taking action in December. Following Ms Yellen's speech, Wall Street climbed sharply . The S&P 500 rose 0.8% and the Nasdaq index jumped 1.5%, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average added just 0.1%. Although the focus of her speech was on interest rates, Ms Yellen did address the other tools the Fed has at its disposal if the US economy was to suffer a downturn. These unconventional tools - including asset purchases, forward guidance and negative interest rates, which have been used in Europe - have been criticised for helping banks and not stimulating economies. Ms Yellen defended the use of these tools, saying they helped prevent the recession from becoming worse. \\"They have been effective policy, they have made a difference and inflation may have been lower and unemployment higher - by noticeable amounts - had we not employed those policies,\\" she said. Summary:","output":"US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stressed a cautious approach towards future interest rate hikes due to influencing factors such as oil prices, China's economic slowdown, and inflation reaching the Fed's 2% target."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) In this photo released by the Saudi Press Agency, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, right, shakes hands with Salah Khashoggi, a son of Jamal Khashoggi, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Oct. 23, 2018.... (Associated Press)      JERUSALEM (AP) — A Saudi dissident has filed a lawsuit against an Israeli surveillance company, claiming its sophisticated spyware targeted him and helped lead to the killing of his friend, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.      The suit, filed in a Tel Aviv court on Sunday, follows others previously filed against the company. But because of the dissident's ties to Khashoggi and his high-profile killing Oct. 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, it is likely to shine a greater spotlight on the Israeli company and the Israeli government, which licenses the export of the surveillance technology.      According to the lawsuit, Omar Abdulaziz, a sharp critic on social media of the Saudi royals and a resident of Canada where he has received asylum, said he was friends with Khashoggi and worked with him on a project meant to rein in pro-monarchy Saudi trolls.      The lawsuit says Abdulaziz received and clicked on a link sent to his phone in June 2018 that he argues exposed his mobile communications to Saudi authorities. It says Abdulaziz faced increased harassment by Saudi authorities after he clicked on the link, including against his family members in Saudi Arabia.      \\"The spying that was directed against (Abdulaziz) and the disclosure of the content of the conversations and messages between him and Khashoggi through the system contributed in a tangible way to the decision to assassinate Mr. Khashoggi by the assassins at the consulate,\\" the lawsuit states, citing news reports and other sources claiming that NSO Group sold Saudi Arabia the technology in 2017 for 55 million.      Abdulaziz is demanding 600,000 shekels — about 160,000 — in damages from the company, as well as an order preventing it from selling its technology, known as \\"Pegasus,\\" to Saudi Arabia.      In a written statement, NSO Group said the company's technology \\"enables governments and law enforcement agencies to fight terrorism and crime.\\" It said it takes \\"an extremely scrupulous\\" approach to the sale of its products, which also undergo vetting and licensing by Israel's defense ministry.      \\"We do not tolerate misuse of our products. If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract,\\" it said.      NSO has been under the spotlight for months after dissidents, journalists and other opposition figures have come forward to claim the company's technology has been used by repressive governments to spy on them. These include Mexican and Qatari journalists who have already filed lawsuits against the company and an Amnesty International employee who was allegedly targeted by the software.      The new suit comes days after the human rights group said it was considering legal steps to have NSO Group's export license revoked. It said it had made an urgent request to Israel's defense ministry to have the company's export license revoked following the targeting of one of its employees. It said the request was denied.      \\"We thoroughly reject this inadequate response. The mountain of evidence and reports on NSO Group and the sale of its spyware to human rights-violating regimes is substantial proof that NSO has gone rogue,\\" said Molly Malekar, programs director of Amnesty International Israel.      By continuing to approve of NSO, she added, Israel's defense ministry is practically admitting to knowingly cooperating with a company whose \\"software is used to commit human rights abuses.\\" ||||| London (CNN) In his public writings, Jamal Khashoggi's criticism of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was measured. In private, the Washington Post columnist didn't hold back.      In more than 400 WhatsApp messages sent to a fellow Saudi exile in the year before he was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Khashoggi describes bin Salman -- often referred to as MBS -- as a \\"beast,\\" a \\"pac-man\\" who would devour all in his path, even his supporters.      CNN has been granted exclusive access to the correspondence between Khashoggi and Montreal-based activist Omar Abdulaziz. The messages shared by Abdulaziz, which include voice recordings, photos and videos, paint a picture of a man deeply troubled by what he regarded as the petulance of his kingdom's powerful young prince.      \\"The more victims he eats, the more he wants,\\" says Khashoggi in one message sent in May, just after a group of Saudi activists had been rounded up . \\"I will not be surprised if the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him on.\\"      This is what logic says, but I no longer have faith in it to analyze the man's mind.      Is there a possibility that when he becomes a King he would pardon them      Arrests are unjustified and do not serve him (logic says), but tyranny has no logic, but he loves force, oppression and needs to show them off. He is like a beast \\"pac man\\" the more victims he eats, the more he wants. I will not be surprised that the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him, then others and others and so on. God knows      The exchanges reveal a progression from talk to action -- the pair had begun planning an online youth movement that would hold the Saudi state to account. \\"[Jamal] believed that MBS is the issue, is the problem and he said this kid should be stopped,\\" Abdulaziz said in an interview with CNN.      But in August, when he believed their conversations may have been intercepted by Saudi authorities, a sense of foreboding descends over Khashoggi. \\"God help us,\\" he wrote.      Two months later, he was dead.      Abdulaziz on Sunday launched a lawsuit against an Israeli company that invented the software he believes was used to hack his phone.      \\"The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,\\" Abdelaziz told CNN. \\"The guilt is killing me.\\"      Omar Abdulaziz believes Saudi authorities intercepted private messages between him and Jamal Khashoggi.      SIM cards and financial support      Abdulaziz began speaking out against the Saudi regime as a college student in Canada. His pointed criticisms of government policies drew the attention of the Saudi state, which canceled his university scholarship. Canada granted him asylum in 2014 and made him a permanent resident three years later.      In almost daily exchanges between October 2017 and August 2018, Khashoggi and Abdulaziz conceived plans to form an electronic army to engage young Saudis back home and debunk state propaganda on social media, leveraging Khashoggi's establishment profile and the 27-year-old Abdulaziz's 340,000-strong Twitter following.      The digital offensive, dubbed the \\"cyber bees,\\" had emerged from earlier discussions about creating a portal for documenting human rights abuses in their homeland as well an initiative to produce short films for mobile distribution. \\"We have no parliament; we just have Twitter,\\" said Abdulaziz, adding that Twitter is also the Saudi government's strongest weapon. \\"Twitter is the only tool they're using to fight and to spread their rumors. We've been attacked, we've been insulted, we'd been threatened so many times, and we decided to do something.\\"      The pair's scheme involved two key elements that Saudi Arabia might well have viewed as hostile acts. The first involved sending foreign SIM cards to dissidents back home so they could tweet without being traced. The second was money. According to Abdulaziz, Khashoggi pledged an initial 30,000 and promised to drum up support from rich donors under the radar.      In one exchange, dated May this year, Abdulaziz writes to Khashoggi. \\"I sent you some ideas about the electronic army. By email.\\"      \\"Brilliant report,\\" Khashoggi replies. \\"I will try to sort out the money. We have to do something.\\"      Omar Abdulaziz I sent you a brief idea about the work of the electronic army      Jamal Khashoggi Brilliant report. I will try to sort out the money. we have to do something.      You know, sometimes I get affected by their attacks and hate tweeting.      A month later, another message sent by Abdulaziz confirms the first 5,000 transfer has arrived. Khashoggi replies with a thumbs up.      But in early August, he says he received word from Saudi Arabia that government officials were aware of the pair's online project. He passed the news to Khashoggi.      \\"How did they know?\\" asks Khashoggi in a message.      \\"There must have been a gap,\\" says Abdulaziz.      Three minutes pass before Khashoggi writes back: \\"God help us.\\"      Omar Abdulaziz Once they heard about the bees, they were really worried and disturbed, the officials. They arrested a lot people and raided many places. I bore the brunt of having the group and communication. I'm glad you're abroad and you are safe.      Jamal Khashoggi How did they know about the bees?      The family's safety      Omar Alzahrani I began to create groups      I began to do some work and surely there must have been a gap      Tens of people must have been involved in this.      Can you imagine my brother was telling me, Omar don't tweet about Canada and about the bees.      !      Otherwise I will go to prison      Jamal Khashoggi God help us.      Omar Alzahrani Those who ride the sea shouldn't fear of drowning.      Jamal Khashoggi May god protect you, you are in Canada which is the sanctuary for the aggrieved people. May god protect you from any Qaddafis or Qaddafi stupidity (Qaddafi as an adjective)      Do not discuss the subject of bees even in Instagram.      The 'hack'      Abdulaziz first spoke publicly about his contact with Khashoggi last month after researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab reported his phone had been hacked by military-grade spyware.      According to Bill Marczak, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab, the software was the invention of an Israeli firm named NSO Group, and deployed at the behest of the Saudi Arabian government.      Marczak said at least two other Saudi dissidents have been targeted with NSO tools: an activist named Yahya Assiri and a staff member who had been involved in Amnesty International's work on Saudi Arabia.      Danna Ingleton, an Amnesty deputy program director, said its technology experts studied the staff member's phone and confirmed it was targeted with the spyware. Amnesty is currently exploring potential recourse against NSO Group and last week wrote a letter to the Israeli Ministry of Defense requesting it revoke NSO's export license, Ingleton said.      On Sunday, Abdulaziz's lawyers filed a lawsuit in Tel Aviv, alleging NSO broke international laws by selling its software to oppressive regimes, knowing it could be used to infringe human rights. \\"NSO should be held accountable in order to protect the lives of political dissidents, journalists and human rights activists,\\" said the Jerusalem-based lawyer Alaa Mahajna, who is acting for Abdulaziz.      The lawsuit follows another filed in Israel and Cyprus by citizens in Mexico and Qatar.      In a statement to CNN Monday, after the lawsuit was filed, NSO Group said it was \\"completely unfounded\\" and \\"shows no evidence that the company's technology was used\\" to hack Abdulaziz's phone. NSO also said its technology helps governments and law enforcement agencies \\"fight terrorism and crime in a modern age\\" and is fully vetted and licensed by the Israeli government.      The statement added: \\"The lawsuit appears to be based on a collection of press clippings that have been generated for the sole purpose of creating news headlines and do not reflect the reality of NSO's work.\\"      \\"In addition, products supplied by NSO are operated by the government customer to whom they were supplied, without the involvement of NSO or its employees.\\"      Jamal Khashoggi is remembered at a memorial in Washington.      'Tyranny has no logic'      The fact Abdulaziz's phone contained spyware means Saudi officials would have been able to see the same 400 messages Abdulaziz exchanged with Khashoggi over the period.      The messages portray Khashoggi, a Saudi former establishment figure, becoming increasingly fearful for his country's fate as bin Salman consolidates his power.      \\"He loves force, oppression and needs to show them off,\\" Khashoggi says of bin Salman, \\"but tyranny has no logic.\\"      Such discussions could be considered treasonous in Saudi Arabia, a country with one of the world's worst records for free speech. In a sign Khashoggi and Abdulaziz were mindful of their security in exile, they flitted back and forth between phone calls, voice messages and chats on WhatsApp and other encrypted platforms like Telegram and Signal.      Omar Abdulaziz Just wishing you happy health, a greeting and every good thing      Jamal Khashoggi I hope you are well Omar. May God listens to you and rid us and the nation from this predicament.      As Khashoggi speculated about bin Salman's future, Abdulaziz was already in the crown prince's sights and was about to receive a visit with a message right from the top.      'Message from MBS'      Last May, Abdulaziz said two Saudi government emissaries asked to meet with him in Montreal. He agreed and says he secretly recorded 10 hours of their conversations over the course of their five-day stay. He shared them with CNN.      Speaking in Arabic, the men, referred to only as Abdullah and Malek, tell Abdulaziz they have been sent on the orders of bin Salman himself, bypassing the usual channels like the Security Ministry. Bin Salman watches him on his Twitter feed, they say, and wants to offer him a job.      \\"We have come to you with a message from Mohammed bin Salman and his assurance to you,\\" one of them says.      Abdelaziz's recorded messages are telling because Saudi Arabia has always claimed its crown prince had nothing to do with plots like the one leading to Khashoggi's death, blaming that incident on a failed rendition attempt, masterminded by advisers and subordinates from the security staff.      Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh.      Chillingly, the men mention also Saud al Qahtani, bin Salman's powerful social media enforcer -- fired and under investigation in Saudi Arabia amid claims by Turkey that he was the mastermind of Khashoggi's murder.      \\"If Saud al-Qahtani himself hears your name, he will immediately know and you can meet with Prince Mohammed directly,\\" says one other man.      Then they recommend Abdulaziz visits the Saudi embassy to pick up some paperwork.      Poignantly, Abdelaziz says it was possibly Khashoggi's advice that saved his life.      \\"He told me not to go and only to meet them in public places.\\"      On October 2, Khashoggi did the opposite. It was the last time he checked his WhatsApp messages. |||||Summary:","output":"Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident based in Canada, has filed a lawsuit against Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, claiming its spyware targeted him and contributed to the killing of his friend, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Suggested answer: The top of the plant, or capitulum, has compact clusters of young branches. Should I validate this answer? Choose your answer from: * No. * Yes. Answer:","output":"No. Peat moss is not specifically about the growth of the top of the plant or capitulum. This suggested answer is incorrect for the question asked, which is \\"what is peat moss good for growing?\\" A more appropriate and detailed answer would be: Peat moss, commonly known as Sphagnum moss, is an excellent growing medium for various plants, both indoors and outdoors, because of its unique properties. It is highly absorbent, retaining significant amounts of water and providing an ideal environment for moisture-loving plants. Additionally, peat moss helps improve soil structure, making it a popular choice among gardeners and horticulturists. Here are some primary reasons why peat moss is good for growing: 1. Water retention: Peat moss can hold up to 20 times its weight in water, ensuring that plants maintain adequate moisture levels throughout their growth cycle. This is particularly beneficial in areas with irregular rainfall or dry climates. 2. Aeration: The structure of peat moss enables proper aeration, ensuring that plant roots receive sufficient oxygen. This promotes healthy root development and prevents root rot caused by waterlogged soil conditions. 3. Soil amendment: When mixed with garden soil, peat moss enhances the soil's overall texture, composition, and water-holding capacity. This makes it easier for plant roots to grow and expand, leading to healthier and more vigorous plants. 4. Acidic pH: Peat moss has a naturally low pH level, often between 4.0 and 4.5. This makes it suitable for growing acid-loving plants like blueberries, azaleas, and rhododendrons. For plants that require a neutral or alkaline pH, the pH level can be adjusted by adding lime or other supplements. 5. Pest resistance: Peat moss is generally pest-resistant, which can help to reduce the risk of infestations and disease in the plants grown in it. In conclusion, while the suggested answer is not accurate, peat moss is indeed beneficial for growing a variety of plants by improving soil structure, moisture retention, and providing a suitable environment for healthy root growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When you choose a currency pair, for example, EUR/USD, the chart you generate will show you how many US dollars you can buy for one Euro.  You can test the relative strength of a particular currency by looking at several different pairings. The various pairs available depend on the Forex service you're using. You can pull up charts for major pairs, such as EUR/USD. You also often have the option of looking at minor pairs as well, such as AUD/CAD (the relationship between the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar). Your chart shows how the exchange rate between the two currencies changed over time. In a candlestick chart, each candlestick accounts for a specific time period you set. You also set the overall time period, which determines how many candlesticks you have.  For example, you could set your overall chart to show a 24-hour period, with each candlestick representing one hour. Each candlestick shows the opening price at the beginning of the hour and the closing price at the end of the hour, as well as the high and low price during that period. Since you chose a 24-hour period, you would have 24 candlesticks total. The position of the candlesticks on the graph shows the fluctuations in the exchange rate between the two currencies over the period of time you've chosen. The time period is expressed in intervals along the Y-axis and the exchange rate is charted along the X-axis. Generally, there are two types of candles: a bullish candle and a bearish candle. On most candlestick charts, the bullish candle is open while the bearish candle is colored in. The differences are as follows:  If the closing price is higher than the opening price, you have a bullish candle. If the opening price is higher than the closing price, you have a bearish candle. The top and bottom lines of the candle itself display the opening and closing exchange rate for the pairing you've chosen. You know which one is the opening and which is the closing by looking at the coloration of the candle body. Then you'll see lines extending from the top and bottom of the candle, giving rise to the name of the chart.  The highest point, at the tip of the wick, is the highest exchange rate for the pairing for the selected period. The lowest point, at the tip of the shadow, is the lowest exchange rate for the pairing for the selected period. On a bullish candle, the highest line of the candle will be the closing price, while the lowest line of the candle will be the opening price. For a bearish candle, the highest line would be the opening price and the lowest line would be the closing. Part of what makes candlestick charts fun to read are the names given to different patterns. Once you learn to identify these patterns, you can more accurately predict which way the market is going to move for the pairing you're evaluating. Some patterns with predictive value are:   Big candles: A big candle body indicates a trend that is continuing for a longer period of time. If you see a large bullish candle, you know the bullish trend is continuing for that pairing. A large bearish candle indicates a continuing bearish trend. A bullish candle might signal you to buy that pairing, while a bearish candle would signal you to sell.  Doji candles: Doji candles have little to no candle body. These indicate the market condition is neutral or tentative. Doji candles can tell you to hold off on either buying or selling that currency pairing. Once you know how to identify types of candlesticks, look at their relative position on the chart. This helps you understand what that particular pattern is actually telling you about the way the market is moving. For example, suppose you see a Doji candle with the candle line at the bottom of the formation so that there's a longer wick and no shadow. If you see that candle at the top of an uptrend, it may signal that the uptrend is reversing. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how currencies are traded in pairs on Forex and how to read a candlestick chart to understand the exchange rate between two currencies over time. It explains bullish and bearish candles, different patterns like big candles and Doji candles, and how to use them to predict market trends and make decisions about buying or selling currency pairs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The outspoken Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw  has carefully picked his moment to deliver a verdict on \\"serious weaknesses\\" at seven of the weakest performing chains of academy schools in a hard-hitting letter to the education secretary. He doesn't hold back on what he describes as \\"worrying findings\\". And just a few days ago the government took a further step towards removing local councils from the running of schools. Draft plans for a national funding formula will mean the \\"vast bulk\\" of government education cash going directly to schools by 2020. That will allow the cake to be sliced differently, but it is also a paving measure for another big government ambition - to make councils running schools in England \\"a thing of the past\\". I understand the Treasury was keen for the funding formula announcement to be made this week, which suggests we may hear more in the Budget next week about the push for more schools to become academies. Many parents in England barely register whether their local school is run by the council or by an academy trust. They're pre-occupied with other fundamentals like a sense of order and community and, of course, exam results. But by and large people do care whether their taxes, their public money, is well spent. So it is no surprise that Sir Michael focuses some of his criticism not just on poor results, but on high salaries and big bank reserves. In essence he's asking if these particular seven trusts are value for money for the pupils, the parents and taxpayers. Is it a partial and skewed assessment as the government suggests?  Certainly there are plenty of excellent academy schools too, which he acknowledges. In terms of council-run schools, only yesterday, schools minister Nick Gibb singled out some of the worst performing local authorities in terms of GCSE results. So it cuts both ways. Labour wants the government to press the pause button so they can look at the system of holding academy trusts to account and ensure it's robust. That's not going to happen.  Instead the government will continue to point to its network of eight regional schools commissioners whose job it is to do just that. If anything, all the signals are that the foot will be on the accelerator towards all schools in England becoming academies. Summary:","output":"A school inspector found some problems at seven groups of academy schools. He says there are \\"serious weaknesses\\" and he's worried. The government wants more schools to become academies, but some people think they need to stop and check if everything is okay first. The government still wants to keep moving forward, and soon we might see more schools becoming academies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

In recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea, and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across striking the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater, though the structure's status as an impact crater is contested.The collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a geology professor from the University of Missouri, completed an analysis of sediment below the ocean's surface, bolstering the single-impact theory. MacLeod conducted his analysis approximately 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi) from the Chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site, while still close enough to be affected by the impact. The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact. Multiple-impact proponents such as Gerta Keller regard the results as \\"rather hyper-inflated\\" and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis, arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple-impact scenario (cf. Shoemaker-Levy 9) which would not leave a detectable gap in deposits. The answer is:","output":"Ken MacLeod"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose first husband murdered her second husband?  Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is shot. The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after he is interrogated and confesses to the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house during a weekend jaunt, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With the help of her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is a success.

Your task is to summarize them. Q: WASHINGTON -- The White House's proposed deficit talks with Congress appear to be unraveling before they've even begun.      House and Senate Republican leaders announced Tuesday that their sole appointees to the May 5th meeting would be House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.)--neither of whom are budget leaders and both of whom function largely as political mouthpieces for their party. GOP leaders also each opted to send only one appointee, instead of the requested four, to the meeting.      \\"I remain skeptical that the administration will take this effort seriously, especially after it all but ignored its previous debt commission and President Obama had to be dragged kicking and screaming to consider minimal spending cuts for the rest of this fiscal year,\\" Cantor said in a statement.      \\"A serious effort to get our fiscal house in order is sorely needed, however, which is why I believe this commission should commence with a clearly defined target and purpose, under a time frame to produce that result -- so that it doesn't end up in the graveyard of previous commissions that failed to improve our nation's finances.\\"      At the same time, some Democratic sources said their own party's picks for the meeting aren't as credible as they could be. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) only named a total of four appointees instead of eight: Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Senate Appropriations Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), House Budget ranking member Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Assistant Democratic House Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.). But it's not the numbers that are the problem.      Pelosi's picks for the talks make the meeting \\"look silly\\" because Van Hollen and Clyburn \\"are just going to do what Pelosi wants, and she's not interested in compromise,\\" said a senior Democratic aide. \\"The picks for this task force all reflect a lack of seriousness.\\"      Obama called for the bipartisan talks during an April 13th address on fiscal policy and announced that Vice President Joseph Biden would take the lead. During his speech, the president bashed the House GOP budget proposal put forward by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) and said he would not accept more tax breaks for the rich at the expense of entitlements. Ryan, who was seated in the audience during the speech, later called Obama's remarks \\"excessively partisan.\\"      GOP leadership aides say there is nothing fishy about their picks for the White House meeting. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said Republican leaders were \\"just trying to be efficient\\" by sending two appointees instead of eight; he called the White House's original proposal of 16 members \\"unwieldy.\\" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel declined to comment on why Cantor was tapped instead of Ryan.      Kyl has played a role in past negotiations with the White House: He was the top negotiator for Senate Republicans in the tax-cut talks with the White House in December. But Kyl threw up several roadblocks to passing the START treaty as part of the tax deal--a top priority to Obama--and the final deal was finally hatched privately between Biden and McConnell.      Reid and McConnell both passed over members of the Senate's \\"Gang of Six\\" for the deficit meeting. That group has been working for months on its own deficit-reduction plan and has grumbled about the White House moving forward with its fiscal plan without factoring in the work the group has done.      The first meeting is set to take place at the Blair House, where a bipartisan group of lawmakers met with Obama for a largely unproductive health care reform summit in 2010. ||||| WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama’s much discussed speech last week on how to remedy the country’s fiscal future was part of a far broader, more strategically detailed political strategy than has been previously reported.      Several high-ranking administration officials have confirmed that the White House laid out plans for the address as far back as the last calendar year, with the president’s economic team and other senior staff members “meeting regularly since February to put the policy together and work on the speech.”      In presenting a fiscal roadmap, the administration aimed to demonstrate Obama's fundamental seriousness towards what is widely perceived to be a looming deficit crisis. But the speech also illuminated both the lack of communication between the White House and Capitol Hill and a growing conviction among insiders that the president must move the deficit debate off center stage in order to tackle other domestic priorities.      The address, delivered at George Washington University last Wednesday, outlined an expansive approach towards leveling the federal government’s balance sheet. Obama expressed a need for simplifying the tax code and raising the rates on the highest earners. He called for a “debt fail-safe” trigger, mandating Congress to pass across-the-board spending reductions if the nation’s debt does not decline. He advocated stronger cuts in the Pentagon’s budget and less waste in Medicare.      His remarks, in all, were positively received by Democrats and derided as partisan waste by Republicans.      Yet build-up to the speech illustrated more than reactions to it. Capitol Hill officials, including the White House's top allies, say they were left completely in the dark. No one, it appears, knew Obama would deliver an address until his top aide, David Plouffe, announced plans on the Sunday shows. Key aides were briefed on its content only days (if not hours) before the president took the stage.      “Members and staffs had no idea what they were going to say until about four hours before the speech—three days after the speech was announced,\\" said a senior Senate Democratic aide. \\"It was pretty ham-handed in its roll out and members weren't pleased.\\"      The abundance of secrecy left the impression that White House officials came up with the idea for Obama’s speech at the eleventh hour in an effort to divert attention away from the debate raging in Congress. “They were scrambling to change the subject from the budget debacle and this was what they latched on to,” said the aide.      Having failed to effectively brief members of Congress on the details of his plan, few lawmakers could therefore amplify the president's message.      Administration officials, for their part, steadfastly refute the idea that they simply \\"winged\\" it.      According to one Obama aide, the president and his team decided in December that he would have to “lay out a comprehensive plan” for deficit reduction “after the FY2011 funding debate had completed.”      Another White House official described the planning as even more specific, asserting, “Its been on the schedule for the Wednesday after the [continuing resolution avoiding a government shut down] was resolved for months now.” Because a vote on the continuing resolution was delayed on several occasions, the date of the speech remained, consistently, in flux.      According to these individuals, the President’s staff had been considering university locations near or in Washington, D.C. for venue well before the speech was announced, with an eye toward delivering subsequent deficit-focused addresses outside the nation's capital the following week.      Michelle Sherrard, a spokesman for George Washington University, did not have a specific date for when the administration first contacted the university. She noted only that \\"The White House and GW regularly communicate about the possibility of hosting upcoming events on campus.\\"      One administration aide defended congressional outreach, adding, “Throughout this process the President’s team has been in touch with leaders on the Hill, including both the Gang of Six [Senators meeting on their own deficit proposal] and Congressman [Paul] Ryan, and other stakeholders like the deficit commission chairs.”      “In touch,” however, remains an inherently subjective phrase. As late as the Tuesday night before the speech was delivered, one extremely close White House ally professed to not having a clue about what would be said. “I don't think they have briefed anyone and I am not sure the speech is done!”      In fact, the speech wasn’t done. According to an administration aide, “the president worked until late in the night Tuesday, and put final touches on the speech on Wednesday morning.”      Why did it take so long to finalize the details on a speech planned months in advance?      For one, various areas of policy disagreement within the White House remained unresolved. In particular, officials familiar with the discussions say, Obama's economic advisers warned against calling for a final balance of three dollars in spending reductions for every dollar generated in additional tax revenue, arguing the ratio was too explicit.      Medicare reform sparked another element of disagreement. In his speech, the president proposed strengthening the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a group tasked with finding excessive and unnecessary spending within the system. Several aides wanted him to further outline specific ways to empower Medicare to negotiate over drug prices and medical procedures.      In the end, Obama kept the speech broad, leaving Democrats officials on the Hill largely pleased.      Several members of Congress also expressed agitation with the timing.      Obama’s speech came after Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) unveiled his own budget plan, giving his own remarks the veneer of a presidential response rather than executive leadership.      Moreover, by calling for additional talks on deficit reform, the president miffed lawmakers either working on or invested in the Gang of Six talks currently ongoing.      “The fact that the president has come out with his vision should be a positive reinforcement, another indication that this is important work that needs to be done,” Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Monday in response to complaints Obama stepped into Gang of Six territory. “And the fact that the President built his vision by borrowing in many ways from the recommendations of the bipartisan commission on which a number of members of that Senate group sat… gives a good sign, a good indication, of the fact that there is a building consensus around the way to approach this problem. So he thinks it’s very complementary to the process.”      But many Democrats don't want \\"complementary.\\" The Gang of Six already gives progressives angina, with the Democratic members of the group -- including Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) -- openly supporting elements of Social Security reform and even extending the Bush tax cuts. Should the president end up complementing or even embracing their approach, the worry goes, no progressive counterpoint to Ryan's proposal will emerge. Instead, the distance between the Gang of Six and the Republican alternative will become the “compromise.”      The White House has been noticeably tight-lipped about its thoughts on Gang of Six conversations, perhaps because scarce information exists as to what, exactly, the lawmakers are discussing. But signs of mounting concern permeate both on and off the Hill.      When Vice President Joe Biden hosts a deficit reduction meeting with members of Congress at the Blair House on May 5, no Democratic lawmakers from the Gang of Six will be present. Instead, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is sending Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Appropriations Committee Chairman Dan Inouye (D-Hawaii). Gang of Six member and Budget Committee Chair Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), one Democratic Senate aide relayed, was more than “irked” by his absence from the talks.      Other Democrats voiced relief over the Gang of Six absence, speculating that both Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were growing wary about the bipartisan group's role.      Gang of Six criticism is more intense off the Hill, with several of the nation’s most powerful union groups laying down crisp lines in the sand over elements they consider non-negotiable, such as ending tax cuts for the richest Americans.      “Any plan to reduce the deficit that does not include ending the Bush tax cuts -- a clear contributor to the deficit -- is not a serious plan,” said Michelle Nawar, Director for Legislation at the Service Employees. “Every middle class family should be offended if Congress calls on them to bear the burden for reducing a deficit they did not cause while continuing to handout more tax giveaways to millionaires and corporations. We'll see what the Gang of Six proposes, but how could any Democrat support a plan that cuts needed services for seniors and children while continuing these expensive tax giveaways?”      Nawar's question presumably extends to Obama, who has punted once on letting the Bush tax rates for the wealthy expire (they will now lapse at the end of 2012).      A far more immediate and pressing concern, however, is whether the administration’s attempt to jump ahead of the deficit debate will yield the type of political fruits the White House envisions. The president’s advisers -- chiefly, former Senior Communications Aide David Axelrod –- have long seen benefits to deficit hawk-ery in private polling.      But the payoff this time around has been limited: An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Tuesday showed that 57 percent of Americans disapproved of the way Obama is handling the economy.      “I think they were concerned about how to give the president credibility on this issue and how to win over some independents,” one top party strategist said of Obama’s speech on Wednesday. “The irony is it won’t give him any. He could have offered 10 billion more in cuts for the CR and it would never be good enough for the GOP.” ||||| A:","output":"The White House's proposed deficit talks with Congress seem to be unraveling before they have even started.

Who would have guessed that a documentary about gamers obsessed with scoring a world record at Donkey Kong would not only be roaringly funny but serve as a metaphor for the decline of Western civilization? 4. The subtitle of the film is actually an unneeded addition since what the film highlights with piercing exactitude are the lengths grown men won't go to in the long run to prove themselves. 5. Not unlike the sleeper hit Little Miss Sunshine, this breezy and engaging documentary has a great deal to say about the American fixation on winning and losing. 6. You don't have to be an '80s kid to see The King of Kong as a metaphor for life itself. 7. Documentaries can make you concerned for the environment or fascinated by penguins. And now, they can make you cheer for a guy who plays arcade games in his garage. 8. A clever structure by director Seth Gordon means that The King of Kong ends up more engrossing than its bunch of geeky characters initially suggest. 9. Hollywood may find it difficult to cast two big-name stars willing to play it as broadly as the real-life hero and villain of this tale. Nor would many self-respecting scriptwriters dare to match the sheer improbability of these actual happenings. 10. Up there with some of the greastest sports docs in that it truly allows the viewer to experience the thrill of competition and agony of defeat. Summary:","output":"The King of Kong is a captivating and unexpectedly humorous documentary that explores the competitive world of gamers obsessed with achieving a Donkey Kong world record.

Context: “Teachers like to agree with each other, when we talk about learning. It’s hard to change that, when the model we have wanted to make work has nonetheless been failing for 40 years.” Professor Brian Boyd No area has remained up there in the contentiousness charts in Scotland as the notion of business and education working together to do something better for our young people. Most schools do not ‘partner’ with colleges or universities. Instead, they are production facilities for undergraduates and college entrants. Fewer are set up to systematically provide apprenticeship opportunities as well as learning. At NoTosh, we’ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do? City of Glasgow College have partnered with Newlands Junior College (NJC) to make the experience of a day in college more than what, in other circumstances, is too often perceived as a day off from school. The Junior College is called this, and not a school, for that very reason, to mark it out as a stepping stone between school and full-blown college. NoTosh helped last August to provoke the team around their thoughts of what 'unschool' might look like. The College was backed and founded by Jim McColl, one of Scotland’s top business people. In the future, suggests, McColl, might be be possible to take funding of learning out of its pre-existing silos, particularly for this group of students, about 60 in every city at these ages, who just need a different approach to the traditional comprehensive approach? A crossover funding model that helps learning happen in both ‘school’ or Junior College and college or university might be interesting. In fact, some of the world’s top universities are thinking of such models for their own students: Stanford’s 2025 project talks about the... Question: After the story ends, how have students at Newlands Junior College reacted to partnering with Glasgow College? Answer:","output":"While the text does not provide explicit information on the students' reactions at Newlands Junior College (NJC) after partnering with City of Glasgow College, it is possible to infer some potential outcomes based on the context and goals of the partnership. The partnership between Newlands Junior College and City of Glasgow College aimed to create a more seamless educational experience and provide a stepping stone between traditional school and full-blown college. By shifting the focus from solely being a production facility and incorporating a more diversified approach, the partnership likely has positive impacts on students' learning and engagement. Students at Newlands Junior College might react positively to the partnership due to the following reasons: 1. Exposure to new learning opportunities - Partnering with Glasgow College allows NJC students to explore different courses, hands-on learning experiences, and the resources available at the college level. This broader range of educational opportunities may result in increased student interest and engagement in their studies. 2. Greater relevance to future careers - The partnership also aims to provide apprenticeship opportunities and focus on the long-term success of students. As students feel their education is preparing them better for their future careers and personal development, they may view the partnership positively. 3. A sense of \\"unschool\\" - The collaboration between NJC and City of Glasgow College prompted a rethinking of the traditional school model, leading to discussions about \\"unschooling.\\" Students may appreciate and enjoy the departure from conventional school norms, finding it refreshing and motivating. 4. Support and guidance - The partnership focuses on judging the success of the educational institutions based on the results of alumni five, ten, or twenty years down the line. This emphasis on long-term support and guidance may make students feel more cared for and valued, leading to a positive reaction to the partnership. In summary, while there is no direct information on the students' reactions to the partnership between Newlands Junior College and City of Glasgow College, it is likely that the students have appreciated the new opportunities, more extensive support, and innovative approaches offered by the collaboration. The partnership helps both institutions create a holistic learning environment aiming for long-term success, which may result in increased student satisfaction and engagement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. who conquered the persian empire and most of the ancient world??","output":"Alexander the Great, also known as Alexander III of Macedon, was the individual responsible for conquering the Persian Empire and most of the ancient world. He was born in 356 BCE in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia, and was the son of King Philip II and his fourth wife, Olympias. Alexander was tutored by the Greek philosopher Aristotle during his early years, who laid the foundations for his renowned military and tactical knowledge. In 336 BCE, following the assassination of his father, Alexander ascended to the Macedonian throne at the young age of 20. He inherited a strong and well-organized army, which he expanded and used for military conquests throughout his reign. He initially focused on securing his authority over the Greek city-states, especially in areas where his father's authority had been contested. This led to the formation of the League of Corinth, a unified Greek alliance under Macedonian control, in 337 BCE, which deemed Alexander the Hegemon (leader). Alexander embarked on his legendary military campaign against the Persian Empire in 334 BCE. At this time, Achaemenid Persia was the most powerful empire in the known world, stretching from the borders of India to Egypt and extending into Asia Minor. Alexander's forces initially were inferior in number compared to the Persian armies, but his tactical brilliance and the exceptional performance of his troops allowed him to defeat the Persians in a series of remarkable battles. Three of the most famous battles fought between Alexander the Great and the Persian Empire were the Battle of Granicus (334 BCE), the Battle of Issus (333 BCE), and the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BCE). His victories in these engagements not only weakened the Achaemenid Empire but also established Alexander's image as a legendary military commander. As he advanced eastward through the Persian Empire, Alexander toppled Persian satrapies, secured city-states, and incorporated new territories into his ever-expanding realm. In 330 BCE, Alexander ultimately defeated Darius III, the last Achaemenid ruler, consolidating his control over the Persian Empire. Alexander continued his conquests even beyond Persia, leading his army into Central Asia and India. He established numerous new cities and spread Greek culture and language, a process known as Hellenization, throughout the conquered regions. However, his military campaigns took a toll on his troops, and they eventually refused to march further into India. Alexander reluctantly turned back and traveled to Babylon, where he later died in 323 BCE at the age of 32. The cause of his death remains a topic of conjecture, with possibilities ranging from fever and illness to poisoning. Following Alexander's death, his vast empire was divided among his ambitious generals, marking the beginning of the Hellenistic Period. These subsequent kingdoms continued to exert influence over the Mediterranean and Near Eastern region for centuries to come, perpetuating the legacy of Alexander the Great and his impact on the ancient world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

DANVERS — Prosecutors said Thursday that the 14-year-old student charged with killing Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer last month also raped her and robbed her of her cellphone, credit cards, and underwear before dumping her body in a nearby wooded area.      The new details were revealed in indictments handed up by an Essex County grand jury. It charged freshman Philip D. Chism with not only first-degree murder, but also aggravated rape and armed robbery in the slaying, which has stunned the small town and garnered nationwide attention.      Continue reading below      “It’s unreal that [Philip] would do something like that,” Jessica DiPietro, 14, a freshman who was a student in one of Ritzer’s classes, said as she discussed the indictments outside the high school Thursday afternoon. “It’s unbelievable. I cannot even process into words why he would do something like that. It’s devastating.”      The new charges provided no insight into what might have motivated a teenager who was developing a positive reputation in his new high school to allegedly turn on Ritzer, a popular and enthusiastic 24-year-old math teacher.      Students have said that Ritzer asked Chism, who had just moved to the community from Tennessee, to stay after school on Oct. 22 in order to prepare for an upcoming exam. Prosecutors say Chism attacked her with a box cutter, raped and robbed her, and then dumped her body in an area behind the school.      Continue reading it below      A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation has told the Globe that surveillance footage from inside the school showed Chism pushing a recycling bin, which may have been used to transport Ritzer’s body, through the hall and outside the building.      “The indictments returned today detail horrific and unspeakable acts,” Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said in a statement Thursday. “This is the first step in a long process to secure justice for Ms. Ritzer and her family.”      Investigators believe that after abandoning the body — taking Ritzer’s credit cards, iPhone, and underwear with him — Chism walked to a nearby movie theater where he bought a ticket to an afternoon showing of Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine.”      “We are devastated and heartbroken by the details of the horrific circumstances surrounding the death of our beautiful daughter and sister, Colleen,” the Ritzer family said in a statement issued by a spokesman. “As a family, we continue to mourn Colleen’s passing and ask that the media respect our privacy during this very difficult time.”      An Essex County prosecutor stressed during a recent court hearing that there was no evidence that Ritzer engaged in any wrongdoing in her relationship with Chism.      According to authorities, Ritzer was reported missing to Danvers police at about 11:20 p.m. Oct. 22 when she did not return home and did not answer her cellphone.      Police found blood in a second-floor bathroom at the high school, prompting a search of the grounds and the discovery of her body shortly before 3 a.m.      Chism was picked up by police in the early morning hours of Oct. 23, when he was found walking north Route 1 in nearby Topsfield. He initially pleaded not guilty to a murder charge after his arrest that day.      Denise Regan, Chism’s court-appointed defense attorney, declined to comment on the indictments when reached by phone Thursday afternoon.      Chism, a lanky teenager, was a standout on the school’s junior varsity soccer team and described by fellow students as quiet and amiable.      “I wish I could say that you could tell that [Philip] was someone who would do something like that, but I can’t,” said Andrew Poland, a 14-year-old freshman who was the same history class as Chism and was a student in Ritzer’s geometry class. “I don’t know what snapped in him to do this.”      Chism will face the murder charge as an adult, while his indictments on the rape and armed robbery charges were as a juvenile offender, and will initially be handled in Salem Juvenile Court.      An aggravated rape charge is brought when there is serious bodily harm to the victim, or when the rape was committed during another violent felony. Prosecutors have alleged that Chism sexually assaulted Ritzer with an object.      Chism is currently being held without bail in a Department of Youth Services facility.      More than 1,000 mourners attended funeral services for Ritzer held at Andover’s St. Augustine Church on Oct. 27. During the service, Ritzer was lauded for seeing “the goodness in other people’’ and as someone who considered teaching not just her job, but her calling in life.      Students at the high school remain shocked by the allegations, with some recalling Chism as a quiet student, who mostly kept to himself but did not show signs that he might be capable of violence.      “I just don’t know why he would do that,” said Alec Cianfrocca, a 15-year-old sophomore who was in Ritzer’s geometry class and was visibly upset as he discussed the charges outside of the high school Thursday afternoon. “I don’t like to think about it much, because it makes me upset.”      John R. Ellement ||||| Story highlights Philip Chism indicted on murder, other charges in the killing of teacher Colleen Ritzer      Prosecutor says indictments detail \\"horrific and unspeakable acts\\"      Defense lawyer declines to comment on action      A Massachusetts grand jury Thursday indicted 14-year-old Philip Chism on charges of murder, aggravated rape and armed robbery in connection with last month's slaying of his algebra teacher, Colleen Ritzer, according to the Essex district attorney.      Citing Massachusetts law, prosecutors said they would ask that Chism be tried in an adult court.      \\"The indictments ... detail horrific and unspeakable acts,\\" said District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett.      The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism, armed with a box cutter, robbed Ritzer of credit cards, an iPhone and her underwear. The aggravated rape indictment alleges that he sexually assaulted her with an object.      Under the aggravated rape and armed robbery indictments, Chism was charged as a youthful offender, but prosecutors said they will move to join those charges with the murder case in Superior Court.      \\"This is the first step in a long process to secure justice for Ms. Ritzer and her family,\\" Blodgett said.      Ritzer was known to her friends and family as a woman who inspired many, whether it be in the classroom or online, with her heart, intellect and positive spirit.      \\"She was happy,\\" said Jen Berger, Ritzer's best friend. \\"I don't even know what the world is like without her. It's a scary thought.\\"      A 2011 graduate of Assumption College who was working toward a master's degree at Salem State University, Ritzer seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike, said Charlotte Dzerkacz, who became good friends with Ritzer in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school.      \\"She was energetic, she was compassionate,\\" Dzerkacz said. \\"You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend.\\"      In a statement, the Ritzer family said: \\"We are devastated and heartbroken by the details of the horrific circumstances surrounding the death of our beautiful daughter and sister, Colleen.\\"      Chism allegedly killed Ritzer, 24, on October 22 in the girl's bathroom of Danvers High School with a box cutter he brought to school, a source close to the investigation told CNN.      Ritzer went to a regular girls bathroom on the second floor when someone was using the locked faculty bathroom.      Chism followed her in, according to the source. Ritzer was punched a few times before being killed, officials said.      Her body went into a recycling bin, then outside the school where it was tossed, the source said. Authorities found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment some 100 feet away from Ritzer's body.      After changing his clothes, Chism went to a Wendy's restaurant and a movie, according to the source.      Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, declined to comment.      A week after the slaying, about 400 Danvers High School students were among the estimated 1,000 people who gathered to pay final respects at the church where the family of popular math teacher worshiped.      Many mourners wore pink clothing -- Ritzer's favorite color -- and pink flowers decorated the outside of Andover's St. Augustine Church.      The Rev. Peter G. Gori, in his homily, offered advice on how to approach Ritzer's death. \\"Perhaps we should ask not why, or even how she died, but rather why and how did she live,\\" Gori said.      Authorities are still investigating the motive for her killing.      Documents filed in a Tennessee court 12 years ago may shed light on Chism's past.      The court papers showed that Chism's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son, who was then 2, because of \\"prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse.\\" The documents said the parents were attempting to reconcile.      Chism's uncle, Terrence Chism Blaine, told CNN in the days after the crime that the boy's parents are now separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in Florida.      The suspect's mother, Diana Chism, last month released a statement through her son's attorney saying her \\"heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer.\\"      \\"Her son was born in love and is dear to her, very dear,\\" the statement said. ||||| More details may be released in court about the death of a popular Danvers teacher who police say was killed by one of her students.      The Associated Press, The Boston Globe and other media organizations have asked a Salem District Court judge to lift an order that bars public viewing of search warrants and other documents in the case of 14-year-old Philip Chism. Some of those documents are expected to be made public Friday.      Chism has been held without bail since shortly after the Oct. 22 slaying of 24-year-old Colleen Ritzer, whose body was found behind Danvers High School.      He was indicted Thursday on charges of murder, aggravated sexual assault, and armed robbery. Authorities say he sexually assaulted Ritzer with an object before killing and robbing her.      \\"The indictments returned today detail horrific and unspeakable acts,\\" Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said.      The indictment says Chism, armed with a box cutter, stole Ritzer's underwear, credit cards and iPhone. A ruling on her exact cause of death is pending.      Chism had previously pleaded not guilty to a murder charge. A message seeking comment was left with his attorney Thursday. The indictment adds charges of aggravated rape and armed robbery.      Chism was spotted leaving a movie theater about 6:30 p.m. on the day Ritzer was killed, then picked up by police as he walked along a highway in a neighboring town six hours later. Police said they believe Ritzer died sometime after the school day ended at 2 p.m., but they have not said exactly when.      Ritzer's family issued a statement saying they continue to mourn and asking for privacy.      \\"We are devastated and heartbroken by the details of the horrific circumstances surrounding the death of our beautiful daughter and sister, Colleen,\\" the statement said.      Prosecutors have not revealed a motive for the killing, though two classmates said Chism was in Ritzer's class after dismissal the day she was killed.      Chism had moved to Massachusetts from Tennessee before the start of the school year and played on the school's junior varsity soccer team.      Court records indicate Chism's parents had difficulties early in their marriage. In a parenting plan included in 2001 divorce papers, his mother, Diana, insisted on supervising any time her husband, Stacy, had with their son and a younger daughter. She cited \\"prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse\\" by her husband. Both adults signed the papers.      The divorce was apparently never finalized after both parents signed an order stating they wanted to attempt to reconcile.      Shortly after the killing, Diana Chism released a statement through her son's public defender saying she was heartbroken for Ritzer's family.      Ritzer was described as an enthusiastic, caring teacher who stood outside her classroom and greeted all students, whether they were in her classes or not.      Ritzer's family has established a scholarship to honor her work. It will benefit graduates of Andover High School, in her hometown, who pursue teaching careers. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A 14-year-old student, Philip Chism, has been charged with the murder, aggravated rape, and armed robbery of Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer.

One of history's bad but important firsts was the first car accident. Cars were still young when it happened. The accident took place in New York City in May 1896. A man from Massachusetts was visiting the city in his new car. At that time, bicycle riders were still trying to get used to the new set of wheels on the road.

In 1943, a bombing mission by a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress that had successfully dropped its bombs on target, has degenerated into an emergency situation over the Pacific. The navigator on board has not been able to plot a course back to the bomber's home base. The lives of the crew and the loss of the bomber depends on the skill and training provided for the navigator who represents a \\"weak link\\" in the crew.

Can an idea be right and wrong at the same time? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"First, let's address each question individually and analyze them step-by-step. 1. What is the work of HR in any company? Step 1: Define the term HR (Human Resources). Human Resources is a department within a company that focuses on managing and organizing personnel-related matters. Step 2: Describe the tasks and responsibilities of HR. Some typical tasks and responsibilities of HR include recruitment, training, performance management, employee benefits and compensation, legal compliance, and employee relations. HR also develops company policies, procedures, and ensures a positive work environment. 2. Can an idea be right and wrong at the same time? Step 1: Define the context of the question. To determine if an idea can be right and wrong simultaneously, we need to understand the context in which the idea is being presented. Step 2: Analyze the possibility of a paradox. An idea being right and wrong at the same time might seem paradoxical, but this can happen when there are conflicting perspectives or contrasting moral standards at play. For example, specific cultural beliefs or social norms may lead individuals to view the same idea as both right and wrong. 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? Step 1: Compare the topics of both questions. The first question is about Human Resources' role in a company, and the second question is related to the nature of ideas and whether they can be simultaneously right and wrong. Step 2: Determine if the focus is in the same general area. The first question is in the area of business and company management, while the second question deals with philosophy and the nature of ideas. Step 3: Provide a conclusion. These questions are not the same, as they tackle different subject areas, and their focus is on different aspects of human understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Plants require what to grow and flower?\\" from the given options is \\"Light.\\" While it is true that plants require water to grow, and certain flowers that grow from bulbs may prefer cool water, this fact is not explicitly represented among the answer choices. However, light is one of the critical factors necessary for the growth and flowering of plants, as it is involved in the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, which they can use to fuel their growth and development. During photosynthesis, plants absorb light energy from the sun using their green pigment called chlorophyll. This energy helps facilitate the conversion of carbon dioxide (from the air) and water (from the soil) into glucose, which serves as their primary source of energy. Plants use this glucose to power their cellular activities and produce oxygen as a byproduct, which is released back into the environment. In addition to light, plants require several other essential elements for proper growth and flowering, including water, carbon dioxide, appropriate temperature, and essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. All these factors collectively contribute to the plant's overall health and ability to grow and produce flowers. To sum it up, while water is vital for the growth and flowering of plants, it is not explicitly mentioned in the list of answer choices. Light is the best answer from the options provided, as it is a crucial factor in the photosynthesis process that allows plants to grow and produce flowers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Prisoners died due to bad camp conditions and the poor supply of food, shelter, clothing, and health care. About a thousand POWs, 5 percent of total fatalities, were shot, primarily in escape attempts. Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest. Punishment for escape attempts or serious violations of camp rules included solitary confinement and execution. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, from 18,318 to 19,085 died in Finnish prisoner of war camps. In 1942 the number of prisoner deaths had a negative effect on Finland's international reputation. The Finnish administration decided to improve living conditions and allowed prisoners to work outside their camps. Hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union ceased in September 1944, and the first Soviet POWs were handed over to the Soviet Union on 15 October 1944. The transfer was complete by the next month. Some of the POWs escaped during the transportation, and some of them were unwilling to return to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Finland handed over 2,546 German POWs from the Lapland War to the Soviet Union.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Paragraph: To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence.

All six murder victims had been tortured and dumped at a busy roadside. He was arrested this month and confessed to assassinations and murders. But Moreno was released, with the criminal age of responsibility set at 14. Article:","output":"Title: Disturbing Discovery: Six Bodies including Teen Assassin Found Tortured and Dumped Near Morelos, Zacatecas The small town of Morelos in Zacatecas has become the scene of one of the most gruesome discoveries in recent memory. The body of 13-year-old Jorge Armando Moreno, along with the remains of four unidentified women and one man, was found dumped at a busy roadside in the area. It is a disturbing incident that has left everyone shaken, raising questions about the dangerous methods criminals are employing in Mexico, even enlisting teenagers. Step 1: Introduce the Case Jorge Armando Moreno's lifeless remains were discovered in a horrific state, revealing that all six victims had been subjected to inhuman torture before ultimately being disposed of. This reflects a distressing reality that continues to grip many parts of the country, where drug cartels are in an ongoing struggle for control and dominance. Step 2: Background of Jorge Armando Moreno The case of young Moreno is particularly distressing due to his age. He was arrested earlier this month, at which time he confessed to his involvement in a series of assassinations and murders. However, because the age of criminal responsibility in Mexico is set at 14 years, Moreno was released – a decision that now seems to have had fatal consequences. Step 3: Reflect on the Troubling Circumstances This grim discovery has raised several questions, chiefly about the vulnerability of youngsters like Moreno. It highlights how they can be targeted by crime syndicates, often using their age to avoid severe penalties if arrested. With youngsters like Moreno being subjected to torment and even death, it turns a harsh spotlight on the potential consequences of current laws around criminal responsibility. Step 4: Discuss Future Implications The tragic case of Jorge Armando Moreno and the other victims underscores the need for both legal and social reform. Authorities must not only reconsider the age of criminal responsibility but also address underlying socio-economic factors, which often lead to young people being lured into dangerous situations by criminal groups. In conclusion, the gruesome discovery near Morelos in Zacatecas serves as a stark reminder that violent crime continues to plague the region. With vulnerable youngsters like Jorge Armando Moreno falling victim to these brutal circumstances, it is essential to address the loopholes in existing laws and commit to social reform.

The Room Upstairs is a 1987 Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie based on the novel \\"The Room Upstairs\\" by Norma Levinson, starring Stockard Channing, Sam Waterston, Joan Allen and Linda Hunt. The young Jerry O'Connell, Devoreaux White and Sarah Jessica Parker all have small supporting roles. The film aired on CBS on January 31, 1987 and was later distributed on DVD. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The film was distributed after its original showing.","output":"Yes, the sentence, \\"The film was distributed after its original showing,\\" follows the preceding text effectively, and here is a more detailed elaboration. The 1987 TV movie, The Room Upstairs, is a notable adaptation of Norma Levinson's novel, featuring a cast of accomplished actors. Stockard Channing, Sam Waterston, Joan Allen, and Linda Hunt played the lead roles, while talents like Jerry O'Connell, Devoreaux White, and Sarah Jessica Parker made notable appearances in supporting roles. This Hallmark Hall of Fame movie was originally aired on CBS on January 31, 1987, attracting a significant audience and garnering praise for its performances and storytelling. Given its success, it is reasonable to deduce that there was a demand for the film to be distributed beyond its original TV airing. In response to this demand, the movie was eventually released on DVD, enabling an even wider range of viewers to experience the story. This also allowed those who had watched the film upon its original airing to re-watch it at their leisure, while introducing the movie to new audiences. This distribution not only helped to extend the reach of The Room Upstairs but also contributed to its enduring legacy as a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie. Therefore, the sentence, \\"The film was distributed after its original showing,\\" accurately reflects the information presented in the preceding text and provides further context on the distribution and subsequent availability of The Room Upstairs after its initial TV broadcast. Overall, the sentence ties together the information effectively and serves as a suitable continuation of the given text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa.

(CNN) -- Bahraini authorities on Sunday explicitly tied the recent arrests of alleged \\"terrorist cell\\" members with Iran, claiming the suspects got funding from that Middle Eastern nation and had ties to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Basij, according to a state media report. A day earlier, a Bahrain Ministry of Interior spokesman said authorities had arrested five people for allegedly planning attacks against -- among other targets -- the interior ministry building, the King Fahad Causeway and Saudi Arabia's embassy in Manama. On Sunday, a spokesman for the public prosecution office -- which has taken over the investigation from the interior ministry -- offered new details about the alleged plotters. Much of the new information was derived from what the official Bahrain News Agency describes as \\"confessions made by some of the accused gangsters.\\" The BNA report specifically referenced money that one suspect supposedly got during a visit to","output":"Iran, and identified the individual's alleged ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Basij forces. The state media outlet also detailed how the accused individuals had purportedly received training in Iran, including instructions on making and using explosives, as well as in carrying out acts of sabotage and assassination. Furthermore, the BNA report stated that the alleged terrorist cell had been given clear directives from their Iranian handlers to target key infrastructure and government facilities throughout Bahrain. These operations were aimed at destabilizing the Bahraini government and fostering unrest among the population, which the Iranian benefactors allegedly hoped would create a power vacuum and allow Iran to assert greater influence in the region. In response to these allegations, the Bahraini government has taken swift and decisive action to counter the threat posed by the alleged terrorist cell. All suspects have been placed under arrest, and the public prosecution office has been tasked with conducting a thorough investigation into the matter. This will include not only examining the specifics of the alleged planned attacks, but also looking into the wider network of individuals and organizations that may have been involved in supporting the cell. In light of these recent developments, diplomatic ties between Bahrain and Iran have already begun to deteriorate. The Bahraini government is likely to condemn Iran forcefully on the international stage and may call for other nations – particularly those in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – to take a harder stance against Iranian interference in regional affairs. On the other hand, Iran has consistently denied any involvement in the alleged plot, dismissing the accusations as groundless and politically motivated. As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen whether concrete evidence supporting Bahrain's claims will emerge, or whether the situation will ultimately escalate into a more significant diplomatic crisis. Aside from the impact on Bahrain-Iran relations, this incident could also have broader implications for the region's security and stability. The discovery of the alleged terrorist plot underscores the ongoing tensions between Sunni and Shia factions in the Middle East, with Iran frequently being accused of backing Shia militants in an effort to increase its influence across the region. As the investigation unfolds, regional actors and the international community will be closely monitoring how the situation develops, with any further escalations posing potential risks to security in the Gulf and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime.

Boxes of old clothes, knickknacks, and accessories lay strewn about, each one seemingly lacking the perfect combination that would transform her into the life of the party without breaking the bank. Just as she was about to give up hope, Nina decided to visit the dusty attic, which was filled with the memories of generations past. Though she rarely ventured up there, she knew that her family had stored a wealth of long-forgotten treasures, ones that might contain the perfect solution for her Halloween dilemma. As she ascended the creaky attic stairs, dodging cobwebs and brushing aside years of accumulated grime, Nina felt a twinge of excitement. The dimly lit attic seemed like the perfect place for her to discover the ideal Halloween getup. Making her way to a corner of the attic that seemed promising, she spotted a trunk that she had never seen before. It appeared to be a treasure trove of her grandmother's belongings from her much younger days. She carefully opened the trunk and was greeted by a musty blast of air as she began to sift through its contents. At the bottom of the trunk, she found an old, beautifully tailored white dress, adorned with intricate lace and delicate buttons running down the back. Nestled among the folds was an old locket, a peeling black and white photograph of her grandmother wearing the very same dress, her face radiantly anticipating a night out on the town. Nina hesitated, knowing that the dress must hold sentimental value. But she could feel her grandmother's youthful spirit beckoning her, urging her to don the dress for a night of adventure as the Ghost of Southern Belle Past. She carefully removed the dress and locket from the trunk, making sure to fold up the remaining items before leaving the attic. As she slipped into the dress, the room seemed to fill with fragrant gardenias and magnolia blossoms, as if her grandmother's spirit had come to life along with the costume. Gently fastening the locket around her neck and brushing tendrils of her hair in a loose updo, Nina admired herself in the mirror. As she gazed at her reflection, she realized she looked hauntingly similar to her grandmother in the photograph, and the idea of being a spectral Southern belle captivated her. Using makeup from her everyday kit, she powdered her face white and added dark hollows beneath her eyes to complete her ghostly look. Armed with the locket and the spirit of her late, vivacious grandmother, Nina felt complete. As she floated through the Halloween party that evening, whispers of her ethereal beauty and the spectral elegance of her ghostly Southern belle costume followed her like a delicate trail of confetti. Nina smiled, knowing she had done justice to her grandmother's memory that night. As the party drew to a close, she fingered the locket around her neck, vowing to visit the attic more often, for it was moments like these when history truly came alive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'","output":"The given phrase can be dissected into two parts: the first part carries a negative tone, while the second part leans more towards a positive sentiment.  The first part of the sentence, \\"through putrid writing, direction, and timing,\\" is negative in nature. The use of the word \\"putrid\\" to describe writing and direction indicates a strong feeling of disapproval and distaste. Moreover, when combined with the negative impact of unsatisfactory timing, the overall sentiment in this part of the sentence is decidedly negative. On the other hand, the second part of the sentence introduces an element of positivity: \\"with a smile that says, 'if I stay positive, maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures, Drunken Master.'\\" Here, the subject is trying to maintain a positive outlook despite the challenges presented in the first part of the sentence. The reference to \\"Drunken Master,\\" one of the individual's successful works, introduces a glimmer of hope and indicates an optimistic mindset. The use of the smile is also a positive element, further emphasizing an attempt to maintain a positive attitude despite the negativity in the first part of the sentence. In conclusion, the given phrase conveys mixed sentiment, with the first part being decidedly negative and the second part leaning towards positivity. The overall tone is one of resilience and determination, showcasing the capacity to acknowledge flaws while striving for optimism and personal growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from: - Yes; - No; Given those answer options, answer the question: Addison visited the farm with his sister and they chased all the chickens around.  Given the question \\"Why did Addison do this?\\", is \\"Because there's nothing to do\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"While \\"Because there's nothing to do\\" may indeed be a reason why Addison and his sister chased chickens around the farm, neither \\"Yes\\" nor \\"No\\" sufficiently answer the question in a detailed and comprehensive manner. The question attempts to understand the motive behind Addison's actions, and a more appropriate response should provide insight into those motives. To generate a detailed and long answer, consider the following: There could be multiple factors contributing to why Addison and his sister decided to chase the chickens around the farm: 1. Boredom: The farm may not have many activities or attractions for the siblings, and chasing chickens provides a source of entertainment in the absence of other options. 2. Curiosity: Addison and his sister might be curious to see how the chickens react when being chased or how difficult it is to catch a chicken, an experience that they may not have had before. 3. Playfulness: Children often have a playful nature, enjoying interactions with animals and seeking fun in simple activities. Chasing chickens could be an expression of this playful desire. 4. Competitive spirit: Some people enjoy challenges and trying to outperform others, even when it comes to seemingly mundane activities. Addison and his sister could be having a friendly competition to see who can catch the most chickens or who can do it in the least amount of time. 5. Interaction with animals: Lastly, some people find joy and fulfillment in engaging with animals. Addison and his sister may be attracted to the opportunity to interact with and observe chickens in a natural setting. In conclusion, \\"Because there's nothing to do\\" could be a valid reason why Addison and his sister chased the chickens, but it is not the only potential explanation. This answer fails to encompass the full range of motives that could have led to their actions, and it cannot be appropriately represented by a simple \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" response.

Options: - oklahoma - new mexico - texas - mexico - great plains  Explain why a human would choose \\"new mexico\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"New Mexico\\" as the answer to the question above because of several reasons related to history, geography, and the cultural significance of Llano Estacado. 1. Historical Context: Llano Estacado, also known as \\"the Staked Plain,\\" is a vast, semi-arid, and elevated region located mostly in eastern New Mexico and northwest Texas. The area has a rich history of exploration and settlement, with many prominent explorers such as Francisco Coronado passing through in search of the fabled \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" in 1541. The Llano Estacado region was the focus of much exploration and development during the early days of the Spanish colonial period, particularly in the 16th and 17th centuries. Since the original question references an individual who was \\"bound for Llano Estacado,\\" this historical context suggests that New Mexico would be a plausible destination. 2. Geographical Factors: Apart from its historical association, the Llano Estacado region is also geographically situated within the borders of New Mexico. The area stretches from northeastern New Mexico into the Texas Panhandle and eastern portions of Colorado and Oklahoma. Since the individual mentioned in the question is traveling to Llano Estacado, it is not unreasonable to assume that they might be headed toward the New Mexico portion of the plain. 3. Cultural Significance: The Llano Estacado has a unique cultural identity, thanks to its historical significance, landscape, and the indigenous communities that have lived in the region for centuries. New Mexico, in particular, retains a strong connection to its Native American, Spanish, and Mexican cultural roots. The state is renowned for its striking landscapes, including the Llano Estacado, which have significantly influenced the arts, literature, and folklore of the region. Choosing New Mexico as the individual's end goal aligns with the cultural aspects associated with Llano Estacado. 4. Proximity to Well-Known Destinations: Choosing New Mexico as the end goal also makes sense in terms of the region's proximity to other noteworthy destinations. These include the Pecos River Valley, which runs along the eastern edge of Llano Estacado, and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which form the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. Additionally, New Mexico is home to several historic cities and Native American cultural sites, which could make it an appealing destination for an individual traveling to Llano Estacado. 5. Process of Elimination: By examining the options listed, a human might conclude that New Mexico is the most fitting answer. Oklahoma and the Great Plains aren't directly associated with Llano Estacado. Texas, although geographically connected to Llano Estacado, may not best capture the historical and cultural significance of the region in comparison to New Mexico. The end goal being Mexico seems less likely, as it's further away and doesn't hold the same connection to Llano Estacado. In summary, a human would choose \\"New Mexico\\" to answer the question above due to the historical context, geographical factors, cultural significance, proximity to well-known destinations, and the process of elimination. The connection between Llano Estacado and New Mexico's unique cultural, historical, and geographical elements makes it a reasonable and fitting answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Earlier in the 1970s, Randy Newman wrote another jingle entitled \`\`The Most Original Soft Drink Ever''. Barry Manilow performed Holmes's jingle in concerts and on albums under the inclusion of \`\`VSM -- Very Strange Medley''. A TV commercial was also created using the jingle and ran from 1977 to 1985. The song noted \`\`It's not a cola, it's something much much more. It's not a root beer, you get root beer by the score.'' (W.W. Clements, former CEO and president of the Dr Pepper/7-Up Company, similarly described the taste of Dr Pepper as one-of-a-kind, saying, \`\`I've always maintained you cannot tell anyone what Dr Pepper tastes like because it's so different.

Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is root beer and dr pepper the same?","output":"Based on the information provided in the text, root beer and Dr Pepper are not the same. Dr Pepper is described as a distinctively different type of drink with a unique taste of its own and is not classified under any traditional flavor profiles, including root beer. The jingle from 1978 by Jake Holmes underscores this by stating, \\"It's not a cola, it's something much much more. It's not a root beer, you get root beer by the score.\\" Furthermore, former CEO and president of the Dr Pepper/7-Up Company, W.W. Clements, echoed this perspective, emphasizing that Dr Pepper cannot be compared to any other traditional beverage flavors, including root beer. Therefore, despite both being popular carbonated beverages, root beer and Dr Pepper have unique, distinct taste profiles and are not the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  While driving his Dual-Ghia from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, lecherous, heavy-drinking pop singer Dino is forced to detour through Climax, Nevada. There he meets the amateur songwriting team of Barney Millsap, a gas station attendant, and piano teacher Orville J. Spooner, a man easily given to jealousy. Hoping to interest Dino in their songs, Barney disables the \\"Italian\\" sports car and tells Dino he will need to remain in town until new parts arrive from Milan. (Dual-Ghia was actually an American marque, mating a Dodge frame, drivetrain, and engine with Italian coachwork.) Orville invites Dino to stay with him and wife Zelda, but becomes concerned when he learns the singer needs to have sex every night to avoid awakening with a headache. Anxious to accommodate Dino but safeguard his marriage, Orville provokes an argument with his wife that leads to Zelda fleeing in tears. He and Barney then arrange for Polly the Pistol, a waitress and prostitute at a saloon on the edge of town called the Belly Button, to pose as Orville's wife and satisfy Dino. That evening after the three have dinner, Orville plays his tunes for Dino on the piano and Polly requests a particular song. It is one she knows he wrote for his wife when trying to persuade her to marry him. Doing so, Orville gets lost in emotion, as does Polly, who has fallen a little for the dream of a domestic life that she doesn't have. Under the influence of wine and song, Orville starts thinking of Polly as his wife and tosses Dino out. He then spends the night with Polly.

While entertaining a girl in his dorm room, he finds that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he travels back in time, and he is able to \\"redo\\" parts of his past, thereby causing the blackouts he experienced as a child. There are consequences to his choices, however, that then propagate back to his present life: his alternate futures vary from college student, to prisoner, to amputee. His efforts are driven by the desire to undo the most unpleasant events of his childhood which coincide with his mysterious blackouts, including saving his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh (Amy Smart) from being molested by her father (Eric Stoltz) and tormented by her sadistic brother (William Lee Scott).The actions he takes, and those he enables others to take during his blackouts, change the timeline in the new future where he awakes. As he continues to do this he realizes that even though his intentions are good his actions have unforeseen consequences.

The radio signal's electrical component induces a voltage in the conductor. This causes an electrical current to begin flowing in the direction of the signal's instantaneous field. When the resulting current reaches the end of the conductor, it reflects, which is equivalent to a 180 degree change in phase. If the conductor is 1⁄4 of a wavelength long, current from the feed point will undergo 90 degree phase change by the time it reaches the end of the conductor, reflect through 180 degrees, and then another 90 degrees as it travels back. That means it has undergone a total 360 degree phase change, returning it to the original signal. The current in the element thus adds to the current being created from the source at that instant. This process creates a standing wave in the conductor, with the maximum current at the feed. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What part of the radio signal creates voltage?","output":"The part of the radio signal that creates voltage is the varying electric field component.

Read this article and answer this question The Raiders traveled to take on Washington on Sunday Night Football. Beginning a rough night for Derek Carr, on the second play of the game, Carr threw his first interception on the season. Washington took advantage of the turnover, driving 67 yards on eight plays as Kirk Cousins hit Chris Thompson on a 22-yard pass to give Washington the lead 7-0. The teams exchanged punts on each of their next three possessions, but the Raiders turned the ball over again with 10 minutes remaining in the second quarter when Carr was picked off for the second time in the game. Washington again took advantage, driving 72 yards and scoring their second touchdown on a Vernon Davis 18-yard touchdown catch. As a result, the Raiders trailed 14-0 at the half. The Raider offense was completely shut down in the first half, managing only 47 yards from scrimmage. Washington continued to dominate the Raiders in the second half, driving 75 yards on the opening possession and upping the lead to 21-0 on a Josh Doctson 52-yard touchdown catch. A punt by the Raiders followed and Washington missed a field goal attempt on their next possession as the score remained 21-0. On the Raiders next possession, they were forced to punt, but Jamison Crowder muffed the punt and the Raiders recovered at the Washington 18-yard line. Two plays later, Carr hit Jared Cook from 21 yards out to notch the Raiders first points and cutting the lead to 21-7. A Washington field goal moved the lead to 24-7 as the Raiders were forced to punt again. Following a fumble on the next Washington possession, the Raiders could not get into the end zone from the Washington 20 and were forced to settle for a Giorgio Tavecchio 22-yard field goal. Washington answered the field goal with their own to move the lead back to 17 at 27-10. Neither team could muster anything further as the Raiders fell 27-10. The loss moved the Raiders to 2-1 on the season. The disappointing performance was led by the Raider offense which went 0-11 on third down tries and managed only 128 total yards. Meanwhile, the Raider defense gave up 472 yards to Washington, 356 through the air. Who shut down the Raider's offense in the first half?","output":"In the first half of the game, the Raider's offense was shut down by the Washington football team.

One time when I was quite young, perhaps five or so, I went ice fishing with Dad. It was a bright, clear day--and bitterly cold. After we'd been out on the ice for a little while, my feet started getting cold. \\"Daddy, my feet are cold.\\" I said. \\"Yeah, it's cold out here today,\\" he replied. \\"Tell you what,\\" he said. \\"Walk around. Make some circles in the snow. See how many different patterns you can make. That will get your feet warm.\\" Now, I was just a little girl at the time but I remember thinking, \\"How in the world will walking around in the snow make my feet warm? Dad must be out of mind. But he was my father, after all. I made circles in the snow. I made squares. Pretty soon I was having so much fun making patterns in the snow. I forgot about my feet being cold. Now, all these years later, I know, too, from personal experience how my father was able to take his coat off and work outside in the winter wearing just a shirt, a cap and gloves.

We have this equation: -605*a = 607*a - 1210*a - 24 First, we need to simplify the right side of the equation. We have 607*a and -1210*a: 607 apples - 1210 apples = -603 apples So now the equation looks like this: -605*a = -603*a - 24 Next, we want to move the -603*a from the right side to the left side of the equation. We do that by adding 603 apples to both sides: -605 apples + 603 apples = -603 apples + 603 apples - 24 Now it looks like this: -2*a = -24 Now we want to know how many apples we have if we divide them into 2 equal groups.

Sentence 1: To fall off a point. Sentence 2: They sailed south around the point. Does point mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"No, the term \\"point\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. Essentially, the word \\"point\\" can be defined and interpreted in various ways depending on its context, and in these two sentences, it has been used in two vastly different contexts. In Sentence 1: \\"To fall off a point,\\" the word \\"point\\" could be interpreted in several ways depending on further context, but let's focus on two of the most common meanings.  - \\"Point\\" could refer to a specific location or place, implying a physical location from which someone or something is falling off. In this sense, \\"point\\" could also refer to the edge or tip of a physical object. Falling off a point means that something or someone has fallen from a particular location or from the edge of something.    - Another possible interpretation could be that \\"point\\" refers to a certain stage within a system or process. In such a context, \\"falling off a point\\" could mean the decline or decrease from that specified point or level. In Sentence 2: \\"They sailed south around the point,\\" the word \\"point\\" is used to refer to a geographic term. In geographical parlance, a 'point' often refers to a specific location on a map, usually the projecting point of land extending into the water, which could be a headland or a promontory. Here, 'point' could mean a specific landmark that sailors use for navigation.  So, in these two sentences, the word \\"point\\" does not convey the same meaning. While it may refer to a specific place, stage, position, or level in Sentence 1, it refers to a geographical feature or place in Sentence 2. The difference in the usage of the term \\"point\\" in these sentences showcases how English words can carry multiple meanings depending on the context in which they're used."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CHAPTER LXXIX  The Wharton Wedding  It was at last settled that the Wharton marriage should take place during the second week in June. There were various reasons for the postponement. In the first place Mary Wharton, after a few preliminary inquiries, found herself forced to declare that Messrs. Muddocks and Cramble could not send her forth equipped as she ought to be equipped for such a husband in so short a time. \\"Perhaps they do it quicker in London,\\" she said to Everett with a soft regret, remembering the metropolitan glories of her sister's wedding. And then Arthur Fletcher could be present during the Whitsuntide holidays; and the presence of Arthur Fletcher was essential. And it was not only his presence at the altar that was needed;--Parliament was not so exacting but that he might have given that;--but it was considered by the united families to be highly desirable that he should on this occasion remain some days in the country. Emily had promised to attend the wedding, and would of course be at Wharton for at least a week. As soon as Everett had succeeded in wresting a promise from his sister, the tidings were conveyed to Fletcher. It was a great step gained. When in London she was her own mistress; but surrounded as she would be down in Herefordshire by Fletchers and Whartons, she must be stubborn indeed if she should still refuse to be taken back into the flock, and be made once more happy by marrying the man whom she confessed that she loved with her whole heart. The letter to Arthur Fletcher containing the news was from his brother John, and was written in a very business-like fashion. \\"We have put off Mary's marriage a few days, so that you and she should be down here together. If you mean to go on with it, now is your time.\\" Arthur, in answer to this, merely said he would spend the Whitsuntide holidays at Longbarns.  Answer the following questions: 1. What month is the wedding to occur? 2. Is it during the third week? 3. Is it happening on schedule? 4. Why not? 5. Who would be able to come now? 6. Who got married before her? 7.

Article: At school, besides cheating on a test, a kid might cheat in other ways. They might steal someone else's idea for a science project, or copy a book report from the Internet and hand it in as if it's his or her work. Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who study for the test or who are the true winners of a game. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even though there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test need to talk with the teacher or another grown-up. They can find some ways to help solve this problem. Talking about the problem and working it out will make him or her feel better than cheating. Kids who cheat may feel worried about getting caught. Whether they are caught or not, these kids may feel _ or embarrassed. Even if they feel fine or don't get caught, that doesn't mean it's OK. There's an old saying that cheaters never win and winners never cheat. This may sound difficult to understand, because sometimes it seems like cheaters do win--- at least for the moment. However, sooner or later, they'll pay the price. It's just a matter of time only. And kids who don't cheat are true winners because, when they win, they do it honestly.

Process:  - Grass and small plants grow in an area - These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less fertile soil happens, how will it affect soil becomes more fertile.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that there is a change in the soil fertility - in this case, it becomes less fertile. Step 2: Identify the factors affecting soil fertility Soil fertility is affected by the presence of organic material (from dead plants and other organisms), nutrients, water, and other factors. In this context, the fertility increase is mainly due to the addition of organic material from dead plants. Step 3: How less fertile soil affects the process If the soil becomes less fertile, this may lead to a reduction in the growth of grass and small plants, as they would have fewer nutrients and other necessary elements to support their growth. Step 4: Determine the direct effect of less fertile soil With fewer grasses and small plants growing, there would be less organic material added to the soil when they die. This could cause a negative feedback loop, where soil fertility is not increased as much due to the lower amount of organic material being added. Step 5: Determine indirect effects of less fertile soil In addition to the direct effect on soil fertility, less fertile soil might also indirectly affect other aspects of the ecosystem. For example, there may be less water retained in the soil for plant use, or beneficial microbes may not be as abundant. This could further reduce the ability of the soil to gain fertility. Step 6: Consider the impact on larger plants and trees If soil fertility is not increasing as much due to the perturbation, larger plants and trees may struggle to grow in the affected area. Without sufficient nutrients to support their growth, they may not be able to establish or compete successfully with other organisms. Step 7: Evaluate the perturbation hypothesis Based on the analysis, it appears that the perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process. Less fertile soil would likely negatively affect the ability of the soil to become more fertile, both directly (through reduced organic material input) and indirectly (through other factors like water retention or microbial activity). This would, in turn, impact the growth of larger plants and trees in the area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...  and the situation: Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds.  Answer the following question: Which farm will grow fewer crops with increased germlines? The answer to this question is:","output":"Valley farm, which uses only organic methods and non-GMO seeds, will grow fewer crops with increased germlines. This is because Hill farm uses GMO seeds that have been genetically engineered to have desired germlines, such as increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance, and herbicide tolerance. These attributes can make GMO crops more productive and resilient compared to non-GMO crops."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – Sarah Burke's family has more than grief to deal with after her tragic death: The skier racked up more than half a million dollars in medical bills after her accident, CTV reports. The family has set up a website seeking donations to help—so far they've raised almost 125,000. It's unclear whether Burke had insurance to cover the kind of accident she suffered; the Canadian Freestyle Ski Association provided coverage for her, but only in CFSA-sanctioned events. Burke was injured during an event put on by her sponsor, Monster Energy.","output":"Title: Sarah Burke's Family Faces Big Medical Bills After Tragic Accident Once upon a time, there was a very talented skier named Sarah Burke. She was really good at skiing and many people loved to watch her perform amazing tricks in the snow. But one day, Sarah had a very bad accident while she was skiing at an event. This made her family and friends very sad. When someone gets really hurt, they need to go to the hospital so that doctors and nurses can help them feel better. The hospital is a place where they can be taken care of and get better. And that's what happened to Sarah, too. She had to go to the hospital because of her accident. But going to the hospital can also cost a lot of money. Sarah's hospital bills added up to more than half a million dollars. This is a really big number, much bigger than the number of fingers and toes you have! Her family started to worry because they didn't have enough money to pay that big number. This is when something called insurance can help. Insurance is like a big piggy bank that people can use when they really need help with money. But sometimes, insurance doesn't cover everything. It's like having a piggy bank that only helps pay for certain toys, but not all the toys you want. In Sarah's case, her insurance was only going to help pay for some things, not everything. It turns out that her insurance from the Canadian Freestyle Ski Association would only help if her accident had happened at one of their events. Unfortunately, her accident happened at an event organized by a different group called Monster Energy. So, to help Sarah's family, they made a special website. This website was like a big sign saying, \\"Help us raise money to pay for Sarah's hospital bills!\\" And guess what? People cared about Sarah and her family, so they started giving money. So far, the family has been able to collect almost 125,000. This is a lot of money, but they still need more to pay that big number for the hospital. Sometimes, life can be very hard and sad. But when people come together to help each other, like they did for Sarah's family, it can make things a little easier. It shows us that even in tough times, people can support each other and spread love and kindness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you want to make the best possible impression on your customers, package the product elegantly (making sure it won't break during shipping), bring it to the post office, and ship it off. It's really as simple as that. Unfortunately, sometimes the customer isn't going to like what they bought. Make the return/exchange policy clear, but don't burn bridges by refusing a refund. Eating these refund costs will be a good business practice, and should keep your Amazon/eBay/Etsy ratings high.  Cycle the feedback you get into making your products even better. Iterate on bad designs, negative interactions, or product flaws. Remember that the customer is always right, even when they aren't. It's one of the hardest parts of doing business, but it's one of the oldest rules in the book. If you treat your customers like undeserving bums, they'll feel like that. And while that may feel good after a brutal exchange, it certainly doesn't pad the wallet. In the beginning, it can be a good strategy to stay focused on one or two products, so that you get a hang of the process and don't spend too much time juggling pictures, descriptions, demographics, etc. After you've gotten a foothold in a market and developed confidence in an e-commerce platform (such as eBay), it could be profitable to start selling distinct, but related, products. If you're serious about making money, you'll want to look at your sales after a couple months and figure out how to increase them. Here are just a few ideas you can use:  Negotiate better prices from wholesale. As you buy more in bulk, your power to negotiate goes up. Don't be afraid to use it! The wholesalers want your business. Look for recurring revenue sources. Think about ways you can ensure repeat business. Could email, snail mail, a subscription pack, or something else creative get you return business? Ask for help, or outsource. Could a few more pairs of hands and legs help you deliver more packages and increase the sales you make? Especially if you're only selling part-time, constant trips to the post office and regular time sunk into payment processing could be eating away at your profitability. Summary:","output":"To make a good impression on customers, package your product nicely, make a clear return/exchange policy, and always be kind to customers. When you start selling online, focus on one or two products at first. To make more money, try negotiating better prices, finding ways to get repeat business, and asking for help or outsourcing tasks.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement. Asked if the talks included specifics on the size of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, Trump said “what they have is substantial.” On human rights, Trump said Tuesday’s meetings only very briefly touched on the topic, but that the two sides would discuss it more in the future.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents.

She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's.

Answer the following question: Process: - You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body.  Question: suppose the river flows weaker happens, how will it affect less oxygen is taken into the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the question is referring to a situation where the air flow (like river flow) becomes weaker, it could lead to less oxygen being taken into the body. In this case, the perturbation's influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, can be examined in detail. A weaker air flow means that there might not be a sufficient amount of oxygen reaching the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. As a result, the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli could be lower than usual, which may affect the rate at which oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane and binds to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. This reduced rate of diffusion could lead to an overall decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Consequently, less oxygen would be available for cells to use during aerobic respiration, which might limit their ability to produce energy efficiently. This could directly impact metabolism and various physiological processes that depend on oxygen, such as cellular repair and regeneration, detoxification, and the immune response. This perturbation would also impact the exchange of carbon dioxide. With less oxygen being taken up by the blood, there might be less carbon dioxide being removed from the bloodstream in the alveoli and expelled when we exhale. This could lead to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, which may result in respiratory acidosis, a condition that arises from too much carbon dioxide in the body, and consequent disruption of the blood's acid-base balance. To summarize, a weaker air flow, in this case, could lead to a less efficient gas exchange, potentially affecting both oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide removal. This perturbation could thus have a negative effect on overall health and physiological processes, as less oxygen would be available for cellular functions and more carbon dioxide could accumulate in the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house.  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - The Tennessee General Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is a part-time bicameral legislature consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The Speaker of the Senate carries the additional title and office of Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee.

Electrical circuit: An electrical circuit is a path of electrical elements that allow the flow of electricity. It is clearly unrelated to the concept of colleges, so we can eliminate this option. 2. Big town: A big town is a moderately populated urban area. Based on population and available resources, it is plausible for a big town to have more than one college. This is a suitable answer. 3. Big city: A big city is a densely populated urban area, usually with a higher population than a big town. It is highly likely that a big city has more than one college, due to its size and resource availability. This is also a suitable answer. 4. Building: A building is a structure with walls and a roof, serving various purposes such as residential, commercial, or industrial use. While it's possible for a single building to be home to more than one college or educational facilities, it is not inherently related to the number of colleges. It is less suitable than a big town or big city. 5. Fraternity house: A fraternity house is a residential dwelling specific to a single social organization, usually found near or within a college campus. It is not an area where we would find more than one college, so we can eliminate this option. Based on the analysis, both \\"big town\\" and \\"big city\\" are suitable answers to the question since they are both likely to have more than one college due to their size and resource availability.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  and a hint : Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.  Please answer this question : Which student read less about the activation energy barrier? Answer:","output":"Gabe read less about the activation energy barrier. Justification: From the given information, we know that Sean studied the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. The hint provided explicitly links temperature increases to the activation energy barrier, and how it affects reaction rates. Since Sean's focus was on temperature, he likely encountered information about the activation energy barrier.

Not only is it unable to see, but because it cannot receive the visual stimulus from its environment that a sighted child does, it is likely to be slow in intellectual development. Now the ten-month old son of Dr. and Mrs. Dennis Daughters is the subject of an unusual psychological experiment designed to prevent a lag in the learning process. With the aid of a sonar-type electronic that he wears on his head, infant  Dennis is learning to identify the people and objects in the world around him by means of echoes . The device is an improvement of the \\"Sonicguide\\", an instrument produced by Telesensory Systems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif, and used by blind adults in addition to a smart or guide dog. As adapted for Dennis, it consists of a battery-powered system about the size of a half dollar that is on a headgear. A transmitter sends out an ultrasonic  pulse that creates an 80 degree cone of sound at 6 feet. Echoes from objects within the cone are perceived (felt) as sounds that vary in pitch  and volume  with the size and distance of the object. The closer an object is, the lower the pitch, and the larger the object, the louder the signal. Hard surfaces produce a sharp ping, while soft ones send back signals with a slightly fuzzy quality. An object slightly to the right of Denny's sends back a louder sound to his right ear than to the left. Thus , by simply moving his head right and left and up and down, he can not only locate an object but also get some notion of its shape and size, thanks to the varying qualities of sounds reaching his ears as the cone of ultrasound  passes _ . Dennis likes to use the device to play a kind of peek-a-boo with his mother. Standing on her knee and facing her directly, he receives a strong signal in both ears. By turning his head away, he makes her seem to disappear. \\"From the first time he wore it,\\" says Mrs. Daughters, \\"it was like a light going on in his head.\\" What remains to be determined is how well the device will help Dennis cope with...

Does the sentence \\"The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece was very influential in this regard, as were Robert Wood's Palmyra and Baalbec.\\" answer the question \\"What direction did British architecture go in mid 18th century?\\"","output":"While the provided sentence does offer some insight into the architectural influences during the mid-18th century in Britain, it does not explicitly answer the question, \\"What direction did British architecture go in mid-18th century?\\" To adequately answer that question, it is necessary to delve deeper into the broader architectural climate in Britain around that time and examine how the mentioned works contributed to shaping those trends. The mid-18th century in Britain corresponds to a period known as the Georgian era (1714-1830), named after the reigns of Kings George I-IV. Architecturally, this period was marked by a departure from the earlier, more opulent Baroque style, which featured grand ornamentation, in favor of more symmetrical and restrained designs rooted in classical antiquity. This architectural shift was part of a broader cultural movement known as Neoclassicism, which emphasized the rediscovery and emulation of Greco-Roman art, architecture, and principles. In this context, the publication of works such as \\"The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece\\" and Robert Wood's \\"Palmyra and Baalbec\\" played a significant role in driving change in British architectural styles. \\"The Antiquities of Athens,\\" authored by James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, was published in four volumes between 1762 and 1816. This work provided architects and designers with accurate drawings of ancient Greek buildings, columns, and pediments, which supplemented the understanding of Classical Greek architecture. Moreover, it also played a crucial role in popularizing Greek Revival architecture in Britain. Robert Wood's \\"Palmyra and Baalbec,\\" published in 1753, documented the detailed measurements and illustrations of ancient ruins in Palmyra, Syria, and Baalbec, Lebanon. The focus on these ancient architectural masterpieces, which blended Greco-Roman and Oriental styles, contributed to the growing fascination with and appreciation for classical principles. These books, along with other influential publications like Giovanni Battista Piranesi's etchings of ancient Rome, helped to create a fascination with returning to more classical architectural features. As a result, British architects of the mid-18th century began incorporating Neoclassical elements into their designs. Buildings from this period typically featured characteristics such as symmetrical facades, columns with classical orders (Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian), pediments, and minimal ornamentation, allowing for a more refined and harmonious appearance. Examples of Georgian architecture with Neoclassical influences include London's Somerset House, Syon House in West London, and the Royal Crescent and Circus in Bath. To summarize, the direction in which British architecture went in the mid-18th century was mainly towards Neoclassicism, characterized by a renewed appreciation for classical antiquity and a more restrained and elegant style. Works like \\"The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece\\" and Robert Wood's \\"Palmyra and Baalbec\\" were very influential in disseminating knowledge about ancient architectural styles and promoting this shift to Neoclassical architecture in Britain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy can be very frightening. If you are experiencing these symptoms and are feeling really overwhelmed or panicked, take a few moments to breathe deeply. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel scared or upset, and that what you are experiencing now will pass. The best thing you can do is get to the doctor as soon as possible so that they can figure out what is going on and give you appropriate treatment. If you suspect an ectopic pregnancy, whether or not you've already had a positive pregnancy test, get to a doctor or emergency room as soon as possible. An ectopic pregnancy can become life-threatening quickly if left untreated. Your doctor will have a better chance of diagnosing you correctly if you can give them a clear description of your symptoms. Let them know how long you have had the symptoms and whether they appeared gradually or suddenly. Provide as many details as possible. For example, if you are experiencing pain, describe the location, type, and intensity of the pain. You might say, “I got a sudden, sharp pain in my pelvis about an hour ago, and it hasn't gone away.” In addition to asking about your current symptoms, the doctor may want to know details about your overall health and any recent history that might be related to your symptoms. They may ask about:  The date of your last period. Whether your last period was unusual in any way. Any previous pregnancies. Whether you are sexually active or trying to conceive. What type(s) of birth control you are using, if any. Whether you have had in vitro fertilization. Your previous history of serious health conditions, if any. Any medications you are currently taking. A pelvic exam is usually the first step in diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy. Your doctor will check for any particular areas of pain or tenderness and feel for obvious masses. At the same time, they will check to see if there are any other visible causes of your symptoms. While your doctor will not be able to definitively diagnose an ectopic pregnancy based on a pelvic exam alone, this exam can help narrow down the most likely causes of your symptoms. If your doctor suspects an ectopic pregnancy based on the pelvic exam, they may wish to run lab tests to check your hCG and progesterone (pregnancy hormone) levels. Unusual pregnancy hormone levels can be a good indicator of ectopic pregnancy. Your doctor may draw some blood or ask you to provide a urine sample for testing. If your doctor suspects an ectopic pregnancy, they will probably recommend an immediate vaginal ultrasound. Your doctor or an ultrasound technician will insert a small device into your vagina to perform the ultrasound and look for evidence of an ectopic pregnancy.  Occasionally, it may be too early for an ectopic pregnancy to show on an ultrasound. If this is the case, your doctor may monitor your condition and repeat the ultrasound at a later date. An ectopic pregnancy is usually clearly visible on an ultrasound by 4-5 weeks after the date of conception. In some cases, your doctor may wish to perform a culdocentesis. This test can help determine whether you have a ruptured fallopian tube. In culdocentesis, a needle is inserted into the top of the vagina to check for the presence of blood behind the uterus and above the rectum. If your symptoms are severe enough (e.g., if you are bleeding heavily), your emergency medical team may decide there is no time for diagnostic testing. In these situations, the best option may be emergency surgery to locate and treat the source of the problem as quickly as possible.","output":"The article provides guidance on recognizing and seeking medical help for suspected ectopic pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of providing detailed symptoms and undergoing diagnostic tests to ensure appropriate treatment and prevent life-threatening complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Darren Wilson's version of what happened when he confronted Michael Brown has expanded since he gave his first recorded interview to detectives, but the key parts have stayed largely the same. Witnesses corroborated and disputed what Wilson said about events leading up to the police officer's fatal shooting of the unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9. Much of the crime scene evidence supports Wilson's story, but there are also some key differences, according to an analysis of available material. Wilson spent 31 minutes being interviewed by police the day after the shooting, about four hours in front of the grand jury, and another 45 minutes talking to George Stephanopoulos of ABC.

Marketers call this friend-to friend recognition of business \\"word-of -mouth advertising. When you do a treat job for your customer for a band job, people are going to talk about your business. Unfortunately, because we humans seem to feel negative emotions more intensively than positive ones, there're more likely to tell more of our friends about bad experiences with busyness than positive ones. Understand this: customer believes their own experience. You can't make them believed that your company is wonderful when they felt they were treated badly. So, to get positive word-of-mouth going for your business in this service- based economy, you've got to do a really outstanding job for everyone, exactly.

Let me break down the differences step-by-step. Question 1: How can I sell my last 786 digits in currency note? - This question is asking for a method to sell the last three digits (786) of a currency note. - It does not specify any particular currency or note denomination, so it could apply to any note with the last three digits being 786. Question 2: How much I can earn by auctioning my 20 Rupees note which ends with 786? - This question asks for an estimation of earnings after auctioning a specific note, which is 20 Rupees with the last three digits being 786. - The auction aspect implies that the value of the note might be determined by bidding, meaning that the final value could be higher or lower than the face value. - In this question, the currency is specified (Rupees) and the denomination of the note is mentioned (20 Rupees).

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Before purchasing, check the expiration date on the package. Then, before use, make sure you also check the expiration date printed on the condom wrapper. If it’s expired, toss it out. Never use an expired condom. It could tear or fail. Check out the wrapper for any signs of obvious rips or tears. If the package is torn or ripped, toss the condom out and use a new one. Female condoms are polyurethane or nitrile pouches with flexible rings at each end that you insert into the vagina or anus. They collect pre-cum and semen, preventing pregnancy and reducing the transmission of STDs.  Female condoms don’t protect women during oral sex. For that, you will need to use a dental dam, or a condom that is cut open. Don’t use a female condom and a male condom at the same time. It doesn’t provide twice the protection — in fact, it can cause breakage in either or both condoms. These are the zig-zag edges on either side of the wrapper that are designed to tear apart quickly and easily.  Don't get carried away in your passion. Don't shred open the package, and stay away from scissors, teeth, machetes, or any other sharp instrument to open a condom wrapper, or you could tear the condom itself! A torn condom won’t protect against pregnancy or STDs.  Female condoms are more expensive than male condoms, at about 4 apiece. Many women find it easy to stand with a foot on a chair, lie down, squat, or raise one leg up. You’ll find out what works best for you with a little practice. Female condoms have a flexible ring at each end. One end will be closed, a lot like a male condom. Pinch the ring at the closed end of the condom with your thumb and middle finger so it narrows. The open end should be hanging down. If you’ve used tampons before, this is the same process. Squeezing the ring to keep it narrow, insert the closed end of the condom as far as it will go. Insert your index finger into the condom and push it gently into your vagina. Be very careful if you have long nails — tearing the condom will render it ineffective.  You should feel it meet resistance at some point. That’s a sign you’ve reached your cervix.  Make sure the condom is not twisted inside your vagina. If you’ve inserted the condom correctly, the outer ring should be hanging about an inch outside your vagina. It is possible to use the same method to insert a female condom into your anus for anal sex; however, the easiest way is to remove the inner ring and place the female condom on the penis (or sex toy). The penis is then inserted into the anus. Regardless of what’s going into your vagina (or anus), adding some lubricant will help reduce friction. This makes it less likely for the condom to tear. Because female condoms are made from polyurethane or nitrile (a synthetic latex) and not latex, it is safe to use oil-based, water-based, or silicon-based lube with a female condom. It’s important to use your hand to guide the penis or sex toy inside you so that it doesn’t end up sliding outside the condom pouch. You should stop having sex immediately, remove the condom, and insert a new female condom if any of these things happen:  The condom slips The penis or sex toy enters your vagina (or anus) outside the condom pouch during sex The outer ring of the condom enters the vagina You may wish to consider using emergency contraception (the morning-after pill) if your partner has ejaculated inside your vagina, on the vaginal opening, or if semen drips from the anus onto the vaginal opening. Squeeze the outer ring closed with two fingers. Gently slide the condom out of your vagina or anus. Don’t yank or tug on it, as this could break the condom. discreetly. Tie the open end in a knot to prevent spillage. Wrap it in toilet paper or tissue, and throw it in a trash can.  Don’t flush condoms down the toilet. Most septic systems can’t handle them, and they may clog up the toilet.  Don’t reuse female condoms.

Please answer the following question: Question: how does gilgamesh consequently view his immortality I found the following answer on Google: Nevertheless, Gilgamesh's fame lived on after his death, because of his great building projects, and his account of what Utnapishtim told him happened during the flood. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the statement you found on Google is partially correct in addressing how Gilgamesh views his immortality. However, there is much more depth to Gilgamesh's perspective on immortality that needs to be considered. The Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest known literary works, revolves around the story of Gilgamesh, the King of Uruk, searching for immortality. Throughout the epic, Gilgamesh is portrayed as a strong and determined hero who nevertheless also struggles with the reality of his mortality. At the beginning of the story, Gilgamesh is marked by his arrogance and oppressive rule over the people of Uruk. He is considered two-thirds god and one-third human, which makes him almost but not completely immortal. He believes that his demigod status entitles him to immortality. However, his life takes a significant turn when he becomes friends with Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to rival Gilgamesh. Through the course of their adventures and friendship, Gilgamesh becomes kinder and more empathetic. When Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh is deeply affected by the loss and is struck by the inevitability of his own mortality. Consequently, he embarks on a quest to find Utnapishtim, the one human who achieved immortality after surviving the great flood, to learn the secret of eternal life. After overcoming numerous challenges and trials, Gilgamesh finally reaches Utnapishtim, who tells him the story of the flood and explains that the gods granted him immortality as a unique gift for surviving. Utnapishtim presents Gilgamesh with a test to achieve immortality - to stay awake for six days and seven nights. Gilgamesh ultimately fails this test. However, on his return journey to Uruk, Gilgamesh gains valuable insights into the nature of life and the importance of leaving a lasting legacy. He eventually comes to terms with his mortality, recognizing that he cannot achieve physical immortality. Instead, he refocuses his energies on building great structures and stories about his deeds, thus ensuring that his name and accomplishments live on in the memory of future generations. So, while it is accurate to say that Gilgamesh's fame lives on after his death through his building projects and stories, it is also essential to highlight his internal journey through which he comes to accept the reality of his mortality and discovers a different kind of immortality, one rooted in the impact he leaves behind. Overall, Gilgamesh's view of immortality evolves from a desire for eternal life to an acceptance of leaving a lasting legacy as the true immortality that can be achieved by humans."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Astérix was originally serialised in Pilote magazine, debuting in the first issue on 29 October 1959. In 1961 the first book was put together, titled Asterix the Gaul. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966s Asterix and the Big Fight sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth Asterix volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days. How many more of the fifth book sold than the fourth and third?","output":"To determine how many more of the fifth book sold than the fourth and third, we first need to find the difference in sales between the fifth and the fourth book, and then the difference between the fifth and the third book. The fifth book sold 300,000 copies, while the fourth book sold 150,000 copies.  Difference between fifth and fourth book sales: 300,000 - 150,000 = 150,000 The third book sold 40,000 copies.  Difference between fifth and third book sales: 300,000 - 40,000 = 260,000 Now, add both differences to find how many more of the fifth book sold than the fourth and third: 150,000 + 260,000 = 410,000 So, 410,000 more copies of the fifth book were sold than the fourth and third books combined."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.

The magazine's intention was to put to the test the idea that every person has a price, no matter how small. By cashing the checks for minuscule amounts, these celebrities demonstrated that they were willing to go to the effort of depositing insignificant amounts of money, possibly for the sake of being thrifty or just taking advantage of any financial opportunity presented to them.

Article: Hanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean \\"high (river)bank\\", though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.

In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions. Despite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit. \\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\\" a senior administration official said. The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration. Trump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border. Trump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall. The disagreement become so heated earlier this year that Pena Nieto canceled plans to visit the White House. It is not clear whether Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Pena Nieto during the summit, U.S. officials said.  But Trump will not meet with Cuban leader Raul Castro or anyone from the Venezuelan delegation, White House officials said. \\"Obviously the Cubans will be participating in the summit, so there will be a mixing of regional...

Playing with toys is supposed to be an enjoyable means of training young children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used. For instance, a small child may fold an ordinary piece of paper into an airplane shape and \\"fly it.\\"  Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment. Some toys are produced primarily as collector's items and are intended for display only.   - Formula One (also Formula 1 or F1 and officially the FIA Formula One World Championship) is the highest class of single-seat auto racing that is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).

Italy Q: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has been accused by Brendan Hughes of ordering the killing of Jean McConville in 1972 in a tape released after his death. He then endured a three-hour ordeal at the hands of the Belfast IRA's youth wing as a warning to stay silent. Upon further investigation into the tape, serious questions were raised regarding Adams's alleged involvement in the murder and disappearance of Jean McConville. It was found that the Belfast IRA's youth wing had subjected Adams to threats and intimidation in an attempt to ensure his compliance and secrecy regarding the McConville case. As a result, the allegations against Gerry Adams sparked massive controversy and drew intense scrutiny from both the public and law enforcement. Many called for a comprehensive investigation into Adams's potential involvement in the disappearance and murder of the mother of ten children. A detailed inquiry was launched by the authorities, examining the claims made by the former Belfast IRA commander, Brendan Hughes. The inquiry sought to uncover further evidence linking Adams to the crime and verify the authenticity of the tape. Various eyewitness testimonies, forensic evidence, and testimonies from Jean McConville's surviving family members were analyzed in the process. Following thorough investigation, the findings were presented to a jury, made up of impartial members who carefully considered the presented evidence. The jury heard the testimonials and examined the gathered evidence before deliberating on the case. When the verdict was finally reached, it was announced that Gerry Adams had been found not guilty of ordering the murder and secret burial of Jean McConville due to insufficient evidence. The jury highlighted the lack of concrete evidence tying Adams directly to the case, rendering the allegations against him inconclusive. The verdict ultimately exonerated Gerry Adams from the grave accusation and confirmed that there had been no sufficient evidence to establish his involvement. Although the jury's decision put an end to the legal proceedings involving Adams and the McConville case, it further fueled the public debate surrounding the role of the former Sinn Fein president in the armed conflict between the British state and the IRA. Many continued to argue that Adams's past actions and affiliations cast a dark shadow over his later political career, resulting in unresolved questions and lasting tensions between Unionists and Nationalists in Northern Ireland. The case also highlighted the dire consequences of unresolved issues related to the Northern Irish conflict, emphasizing the necessity for a comprehensive resolution and accountability for the sake of the victims, their families, and society's ability to heal and move forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  and the situation: There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation.  Answer the following question: Does Marisol have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Chien? Answer:","output":"Marisol has a lower chance of acid rain than Chien. This is because Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity, while Chien uses coal. When coal is burned for generating electricity, it releases air pollution containing sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are the main contributors to acid rain. On the other hand, nuclear power plants do not release these pollutants while generating electricity. Thus, Marisol's reliance on nuclear energy significantly reduces the likelihood of acid rain compared to Chien, which relies on burning coal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language, which means that different tones can change the meaning of a word, even if the pronunciation and spelling are otherwise the same. It is essential to learn the different tones if you wish to speak Mandarin Chinese correctly. Mandarin Chinese has four main tones, as follows:  The first tone is a high, flat tone. Your voice stays flat, with no rise or dip in the way it sounds. Using the word \\"ma\\" as an example, the first tone is indicated using the symbol above the letter a: \\"mā\\". The second tone is a rising tone. Your voice rises from a low to middle pitch, as if you were asking someone to repeat something by saying \\"huh?\\" or \\"what?\\" The second tone is indicated using the symbol \\"má\\". The third tone is a dipping tone.The pitch goes from middle to low to high, like when you say the letter \\"B\\". When two third tone syllables are near each other, the second one retains its third tone sound while the first takes the sound of the second tone. The third tone is indicated using the symbol \\"mǎ\\". The fourth tone is a lowering tone. The pitch goes rapidly from high to low, as if giving a command e.g. stop!  Or as if you're reading a book and have come across something new and interesting and are saying \\"huh\\". The fourth tone is indicated using the symbol \\"mà\\". Easy enough? If not, don't fret. It's definitely recommended to hear the tones demonstrated by a native speaker, since it's hard to get an idea of what they sound like purely through text. No matter what language you're learning, the more words you have at your disposal, the sooner you will become fluent. Therefore, the next thing to do is to memorize some useful Chinese vocabulary.  Some good vocabulary lists to start with includes: times of day (morning: zǎo shàng, afternoon: xià wǔ, evening: wǎn shàng) body parts (head: tóu, feet: jiǎo, hands: shǒu) food (beef: niú ròu, chicken: jī, egg: jī dàn, noodles: miàn tiáo) along with colors, days, months, transport words, weather, etc. When you hear a word in English, think about how you would say it in Mandarin. If you don't know what it is, jot it down and look it up later. It's handy to keep a little notebook on you for this purpose. Attach little Chinese labels (with the character, the pinyin and the pronunciation)  to items around your house, such as the mirror, the coffee table and the sugar bowl. You'll see the words so often that you'll learn them without realizing it! Although having a wide vocabulary is good, remember that in Mandarin, accuracy is more important. It's no good learning a word if you can't pronounce it properly, using the correct tone, as different pronunciations could have entirely different meanings. For example, using the wrong tone (using mā instead of má) could be the difference between saying \\"I want cake\\" and \\"I want coke\\" - two completely different meanings. Luckily, the Mandarin numerical system is fairly straightforward and logical, and once you have learned the first ten numbers you will be able to count to 99.  Below you will find the numbers one to ten, written in simplified Chinese characters, followed by the Hanyu pinyin translation and the correct pronunciation. Make sure to practice saying each number using the correct tone.   One: written as (一) or yī, pronounced [eee]   Two: written as (二) or èr, pronounced [err]   Three: written as (三) or sān, pronounced [saan]   Four: written as (四) or sì, pronounced [ssuh]   Five: written as (五) or wǔ, pronounced [woo]   Six: written as (六) or liù, pronounced [lee-yoe]   Seven: written as (七) or qī, pronounced [chi]   Eight: written as (八) or bā, pronounced [baa]   Nine: written as (九) or jiǔ, pronounced [jee-yo]   Ten: written as (十) or shí, pronounced [sh]    Once you have mastered numbers one to ten, you can continue counting in double digits by saying the number in the tens' position, then the word 十, followed by the number in the one's position. For example: The number 48 is written as sì shí bā (四十八), literally meaning \\"four tens plus eight\\". The number 30 is written as sān shí (三十), literally meaning \\"three tens\\". The number 19 is written as yī shí jiǔ (一十九), literally meaning \\"one ten plus nine\\" (however in most Mandarin dialects the initial yī is omitted from numbers in the teens, as it is deemed unnecessary). The word for hundred in Mandarin is (百) or baǐ, so 100 is written as yì baǐ, 200 is written as èr baǐ, 300 is written as sān baǐ, etc. Once you have a basic grasp of vocabulary and pronunciation, you can move on to learning basic conversational phrases which are used in everyday Chinese speech.   Hello- 你好- nǐhǎo, pronounced [nee how]    What is your surname (family name)?

Choose your answer from: - no. - yes.","output":"First, let me answer the two questions, and then I will tell you if they are asking the same thing. Question 1: Each of these religions has its own beliefs and teachings. Sometimes, people might do bad things in the name of their religion, but that doesn't mean their God supports it. It's important to remember that the teachings of each religion are often focused on love, compassion, and kindness. Question 2: Urban morality and rural morality might have some differences because people living in cities and people living in rural areas might have different customs and lifestyles. In cities, there might be more diversity and people coming from different backgrounds. This can change what is considered taboo or acceptable. In rural areas, the community might be more tightly knit and have specific traditions that everyone follows. What is taboo in one place might not be taboo in another, depending on the culture and beliefs of the people living there. Now, to answer if these two questions are asking the same thing, the answer is: - no. The first question is about finding something morally wrong in different religions, while the second question is about the differences in morality between urban and rural areas.

Unfortunately, that message has not gotten through to the average American, who would rather try switching to \\"light\\" beer and low-calorie bread than increase physical efforts. The Centers for Disease Control, for example, found that fewer than one-fourth of overweight adults who were trying to lose weight said they were combining exercise with their diet. In rejecting exercise, some people may be discouraged too much by caloric-expenditure charts; for example, one would have to quickly walk hard three miles just to work off the 275 calories in one delicious Danish pastry . Even exercise professionals accept half a point here. \\"Exercise by itself is a very tough way to lose weight,\\" says York Onnen, program director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Still, exercise's supporting role in weight reduction is vital. A study at the Boston University Medical Center of overweight police officers and other public employees confirmed that those who dieted without exercise regained almost all their old weight, while those who worked exercise into their daily routine maintained their new weight. If you have been sedentary   and decide to start walking one mile a day, the added exercise could burn an extra 100 calories daily. In a year's time, assuming no increase in food intake, you could lose ten pounds. By increasing the distance of your walks gradually and making other dietary adjustments, you may lose even more weight. Question: What was confirmed by the Boston University Medical Center's study?

Watson says, \\"Seven per cent\\", Holmes says he knows Watson disapproves and has been covertly diluting the solution.Holmes, in a bad mood, complains that Watson's case histories, published in The Strand Magazine, exaggerate and embellish and are more lurid than reality. For example, he is barely six foot one, and Watson wrote that he is six foot four. Watson replies \\"Poetic license, Holmes!\\".Still in a foul mood, Holmes yells at landlady Mrs. Hudson (Irene Handl) for dusting stuff on his desk. Later he has the rooms thick with smoke from using a machine to artificially smoke various cigarettes, as part of his research on cigarette ashes.Watson suggests that he might consider investigating why six acrobatic midgets disappeared from their circus act, as a recent newspaper reports, but he is rebuffed.

Visiting New York City interested Dennis but not Samuel because","output":"Samuel had always been more captivated by the prospect of exploring smaller, culturally-rich towns and engaging in outdoor activities, while Dennis saw the bustling cityscape, diverse culinary delights, and renowned art scene of New York City as the ultimate travel destination that would cater to his taste for urban adventures, electrifying nightlife, and unique experiences that only the Big Apple could offer. Samuel, on the other hand, found the overwhelming crowds and fast-paced lifestyle in New York City to be too chaotic and straining on his senses, which made him long for a more serene, authentic, and immersive vacation just as much as Dennis anticipated the thrill of immersing himself in the vibrant life of the metropolis and its people. Samuel preferred to wander through cobblestone streets, hike lush trails, or bike along scenic routes, basking in the natural beauty and history of a destination and connecting with locals in a more intimate, leisurely atmosphere that would allow him to appreciate the essence of a place on a profound level. In contrast, Dennis thrived in the pulsating energy of the concrete jungle, eager to catch the latest Broadway shows, delve into world-class museums, and navigate his way through the intricate subway system, all while acquainting himself with the myriad languages, cultures, and traditions that intertwined in this global hub, making for an experience that was both exhilarating and unforgettable. As a result, planning vacations together often presented a conundrum for Dennis and Samuel, as they had to strike a delicate balance between their divergent interests and find a way to compromise without sacrificing their individual preferences. Their conversations invariably revolved around choosing destinations that somehow merged the cosmopolitan allure of New York City with the quaint charm and natural appeal of smaller communities, all in a bid to ensure that both friends had an equally enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Sometimes they could manage this feat with a little ingenuity and creativity, such as by tackling the cities early in their trip and then retreating to more peaceful havens in an effort to recover their equilibrium – but even then, they knew that their outlooks on the ideal vacation would always be fundamentally different. Despite their contrasting tastes, Dennis and Samuel maintained a deep bond forged through years of shared memories, laughter, and mutual respect for each other's perspectives. In the end, their affection for one another surpassed their individual predilections, enabling them to forge unforgettable experiences and continue enriching their friendship even as they recognized the inherent differences in their mindset toward travel and exploration. Hence, as they planned another journey, they embraced the challenge of combining their interests, appreciating that the process of negotiation and compromise ultimately reflected the beauty of their enduring friendship – a connection that was stronger than any landmark, destination, or travel experience could ever be."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - glass - shoulder - body - guillotine - bottle The answer is:","output":"bottle When picking up drinks, holding them by the neck is most suitable for bottles. This is because the neck of a bottle provides a narrow and firm grip, allowing you to securely hold the beverage while minimizing the risk of slipping or dropping it. The other options provided in the list do not accurately address the question: 1. Glass: Refers to the material used to make some bottles and cups, but does not denote a specific design feature that would require holding by the neck. In fact, holding a glass beverage container by the neck could make it unstable and lead to spills or accidents. 2. Shoulder: This term does not relate to the design or structure of drink containers. In a human context, the shoulder is a part of the anatomy that connects the arm to the torso on either side of the body, and is not a useful reference for picking up drinks. 3. Body: While body is a term often used to describe the main, cylindrical portion of a bottle, holding a beverage container by the body may create a less stable grip, as compared to holding it by the neck. Moreover, holding a cold bottle by the body could result in condensation making the grip slippery. 4. Guillotine: This term describes a historical device used for executions, particularly in France during the French Revolution, and has no relevance to holding drinks or their containers. As such, it is not a suitable answer to the question. In conclusion, when picking up drinks, the most suitable option to hold them by the neck is a bottle. Bottle necks offer a secure grip, reducing the risk of accidents or spills and providing a more stable and comfortable way to carry a beverage container."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Have you ever looked toward the sky on a fall day and witnessed a group of migrating birds? If so, you probably noted the V-shaped formation of the birds or the birds flying in a ball-like formation. Why do birds fly this way? Many theories have been developed to explain the formation patterns of different types of birds.   One theory is that birds fly in certain formations to take advantage of the laws of nature. The birds know that flying in a V-shaped pattern will save energy. Like the lead cyclist in a race who decreases wind force for the cyclists who follow, the lead bird cuts wind force for the birds that follow. This decrease in wind force means that the birds use up to 70 percent less energy during their flight. When the lead bird becomes tired, a more rested bird takes over that position.   But saving energy is important for more than one reason. Sometimes food is short during migration flights. Keeping energy enables the birds to fly longer distances between meals.     When food is sighted, the birds guide one another in a different way. When a bird identifies a familiar feeding area, it might turn around in order to signal the group to change direction. Then, this bird becomes the new leader. It helps guarantee that other birds will know exactly where it is going. Then the whole group makes a change in direction, gently streaming from the sky down to the ground. This formation is like an arrow pointing to the location of food.   Scientists have also studied the birds that sometimes fly in a ball-like formation. Researchers believe that the birds come together if a predator  is spotted. The predator may then become impatient waiting for a single bird to fly away from the group. The birds will often dip and dive as a group, frustrating even the most persistent enemy. Scientists report that this is a very effective method of defense against an attack.   The birds care for their fellow fliers through teamwork. As transportation expert Henry Ford once said, \\"If everyone is moving forward together, then...","output":"What is one of the main reasons why birds fly in a V-shaped formation during migration? A.

In the first sentence, it is mentioned that Egypt's position at the meeting point of three cultures (Africa, Europe, and the Middle East) may account for its complexity. This statement inherently suggests that Egypt is a meeting point of multiple cultures. The second sentence succinctly states that \\"Egypt is a meeting point of multiple cultures,\\" which is a condensed version of the information provided in the first sentence. Even though the first sentence also mentions that this cultural intersection might be the reason for Egypt's complexity, the core idea of Egypt being a crossroads of different cultures is consistent in both sentences.

Write a title for this article: More than most technologies I can think of, the E Ink screens used in monochrome e-readers such as Barnes & Noble’s Nook Simple Touch and Amazon.com’s Kindle Touch present a stark set of tradeoffs. If you don’t mind the lack of color, their virtues are considerable: they don’t get bleached out in bright sun and allow for an e-reader to go for weeks between charges. But the same E Ink displays that are wonderfully legible in bright light are impossible to read in a dark room. And if the lighting is so-so — like it is on, say, an airplane — E Ink displays are readable, but murky and not very appealing. In either of these cases, you’re far better of with a color LCD such as the ones on B&N’s Nook Tablet and Nook Color, Amazon’s Kindle Fire and the iPad. But now bookselling behemoth Barnes & Noble has a fix. It’s called the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight, and it’s an E Ink Nook with a 6″ screen that lights up on demand. I got a hands-on sneak peek today and was generally impressed. Illuminated E Ink isn’t a new idea: Sony released one of its Readers with a lit screen back in 2009. But in that version, the lighting hurt the clarity of the screen. The company dropped the feature in later models. Judging from my demo of the Nook with GlowLight, Barnes & Noble has figured out how to make the idea make sense. This Simple Touch is essentially the same as its appealing predecessor — which remains available — except that when you press and hold the e-reader’s “N” button, LEDs along the edge of the display turn on, blanketing the screen in light. The illumination isn’t perfectly even — I could make out discrete beams emanating from the LEDs along the top edge — but it’s bright enough to make the display perfectly legible in very dark environments, without lighting up the entire room in the way that backlit LCD displays tend to do. (That’s an important point if you’re reading in bed and someone else is trying to sleep.) In a room in which the lighting is merely mediocre rather than almost non-existent, GlowLight still makes a difference — it gets rid of the grayishness of standard E Ink. I’d certainly prefer it, although it does make it more obvious that you’re looking at an electronic display. (You can adjust the brightness to your liking — and with any luck, the Nook kiosks in Barnes & Noble stores will set things up so you can judge the screen with your own eyeballs.) The lighting option would be useful even if it was a ravenous battery hog, but according to B&N’s claims, it appears to be reasonably efficient. The company says that the Simple Touch with GlowLight will go for two months between charges if you don’t use the light at all; if you use it for a half-hour a day, you’ll still get a month on a charge. Presumably, that translates into about fifteen hours of continuous use with the light on. (It shuts off automatically after five minutes of no usage, so you won’t kill the battery if you fall asleep with the light on.) Barnes & Noble says that the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight will be available in early May at its own stores, Best Buy, Target, Walmart and other retailers; it’ll sell for 139. The non-lit Simple Touch will stay around at 99. Amazon, meanwhile, has a non-touch Kindle at 99 (or 79 with “special offer” ads), the Kindle Touch at 139 (or 99 with special offers) and the Kindle Touch with 3G at 189 (or 149 with special offers). Sony’s Reader is 129. And I’m not even going to mention other contenders such as Kobo. (Whoops, I just did!) Whew. That’s a lot of choices. At 139, the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight competes most directly with Amazon’s no-special-offers Kindle Touch. And the lit screen is a pretty compelling selling point — at least as long as you haven’t already sunk much money into a collection of Kindle books, since they can’t be read on the Nook. Me, I do most of my e-reading on my iPad; it may be much bigger, heavier, and pricier than any of the E Ink readers, but I almost always have it with me anyhow. Still, there seems to be a healthy market for more traditional e-readers. I’m pleased to see that they’re continuing to evolve, and I’m curious to see how long this Nook’s GlowLight screen remains a unique point in its favor. MORE: back in February, B&N knocked the starting price of its Nook Tablet down to 199.

About 2,000 kilometers, or 30%,of the ancient fortification  built in the Ming Dynasty has disappeared due to natural and human damage, according to the Beijing Times. And the situation could worsen, experts are warning as not enough is being done to preserve what remains. \\"It's a great pity to witness the Great Wall in such terrible situation ,\\" Mei Jingtian, a volunteer who has worked for three decades to safeguard the structure and has founded the Great Wall Protection Association, tells CNN. About 8,000 kilometers of the structure dates from the Ming period between the 14th and 17th centuries and is considered by some to be the original Great Wall.Of this, 2,000 kilometers is made up of naturally occurring earthworks - and so only 6,000 kilometers of actual Ming dynasty wall was ever built.  Stretches built in other eras make up a total length estimated up to 21,000 kilometers. Many visitors to china associate the Great Wall with a widely restored stretch of Ming era wall at Badaling near Beijing, but this is far from typical of most of the structure.

Here are possible answers to this question: - vaporate - cool off - form crystals - melt - keep things cold  I believe the correct choice is \\"melt\\", here's why: A:","output":"If ice is not ice anymore, it means it has undergone a physical change and transformed into a different state of matter. In this case, the correct answer is “melt.” Melting is a process that results in a substance changing from a solid state to a liquid state, usually due to an increase in temperature. When ice (solid water) absorbs heat, it causes its molecules to move faster and break the bonds between them, resulting in the solid ice turning into liquid water. Let's briefly discuss the other options to clarify why they are not the correct choice: 1. \\"Vaporate\\" – This term is often confused with \\"evaporate,\\" which is the process where a substance changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor. However, this is not the correct answer because it does not involve ice changing states directly. 2. \\"Cool off\\" – Cooling off refers to lowering the temperature of a substance. It does not cause a change in the state from ice to something else. 3. \\"Form crystals\\" – Ice is already in a crystalline form, as its molecules are arranged in a lattice-like structure. Forming crystals would not change the ice into a different state. 4. \\"Keep things cold\\" – Keeping things cold is a function or utility of ice and not a change in its state. It does not explain what happens to the ice when it is no longer ice. In summary, when ice is not ice anymore, it has most likely melted and turned into liquid water, which is a direct result of an increase in temperature causing a change in the physical state from solid to liquid."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What does Remy need to do before this?\\", is \\"live in a city\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"live in a city\\" can be considered a valid answer to the question, \\"What does Remy need to do before this?\\" since Remy was walking in the city and found money by the sector. Living in a city would make it more plausible that Remy was strolling around an urban area and would come across such a situation. However, the answer can be elaborated further by considering other factors that could have led Remy to that particular moment: 1. Not only living in a city but also being familiar with the city's layout, attractions, and commercial districts would make it more likely for Remy to walk around exploring the city. 2. Remy would need to possess the habit of taking walks and exploring the city on foot. Regular walking can help Remy build familiarity with his surroundings, and increase the chance of finding interesting or unexpected things like money by the sector. 3. Choosing the right time of day to walk can also be relevant to Remy's discovery. For instance, if it is more likely to find money by the sector during a busy rush hour or late at night when people may drop things unintentionally, timing his walks accordingly could improve Remy's chances of finding the money. 4. Remy might need to prepare himself for the walk by wearing comfortable and appropriate clothing and footwear, ensuring he is well-rested, and having a plan or route for his walk, so he does not get lost or overwhelmed during his exploration. 5. Remy would also need to be observant and pay attention to his surroundings while walking. Being aware of details like objects on the ground, people's behaviors, or signs relevant to the sector where the money was found can increase the likelihood of discovering the money. 6. Finally, it would be helpful for Remy to be knowledgeable about the laws and rules concerning found money in the city. Knowing the appropriate procedures to follow, such as reporting the money to the authorities or attempting to locate the owner, would ensure that Remy acts responsibly and legally after finding the money. In summary, while \\"live in a city\\" is a valid answer to the question, other factors like familiarizing oneself with the city, the habit of walking around, timing of the walk, proper preparation, being observant and knowledgeable about laws and regulations also contribute to the likelihood of Remy finding money by the sector."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Cowboys would get on the board in the third quarter as quarterback Tony Romo found wide receiver Miles Austin on a 4-yard touchdown pass.  Washington would respond in the fourth quarter as Gano nailed a 49-yard field goal.

Answer this question: How many yards longer was Graham Gano's second field goal over his first one?","output":"To find out how many yards longer Graham Gano's second field goal was over his first one, we need to subtract the distance of his first field goal from the distance of his second field goal.

Though getting pierced can be an exciting milestone, the most critical aspect of the experience is the aftercare. Proper aftercare ensures optimal healing, minimizes the risk of infection, and enhances the longevity and appeal of the piercing. In this article, we will discuss three powerful methods to soothe and heal piercings: chamomile tea compresses, cold foods and drinks, and the appropriate guidelines for using ice. Chamomile Tea Compresses Chamomile tea is a natural and potent remedy that has been used for thousands of years to soothe and heal various ailments. When it comes to piercings, chamomile tea compresses work wonders. Not only do they help reduce swelling and redness, but they also aid in the healing process due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. To make a chamomile tea compress, follow these steps: 1. Brew a cup of strong chamomile tea using a tea bag or loose-leaf tea. 2. Allow the tea to cool down until it's still warm but not too hot. 3. Soak a clean cloth (preferably cotton) or a sterile gauze pad in the chamomile tea. 4. Gently press the soaked cloth or pad against the pierced area for about 10-15 minutes, as often as needed or recommended by your piercer.  5. Rinse the area with clean water and pat dry using a fresh, clean cloth or paper towel. Cold Foods and Drinks for Lip Piercings Lip and oral piercings, including labret, Monroe, and snakebite piercings, can be particularly sensitive and prone to swelling. A simple yet effective remedy is to consume cold foods and drinks. This technique works as a natural ice pack, providing relief from the inside and reducing swelling, soreness, and inflammation. Some recommended cold foods and drinks include ice chips, popsicles, frozen yogurt, chilled fruit, iced beverages, and smoothies. It's essential to maintain oral hygiene by rinsing your mouth with a non-alcoholic mouthwash after consuming food or drink, as well as gently brushing your teeth to reduce the chances of infection. Avoid Icing Non-Oral Piercings While using ice has numerous benefits, this method should be approached with caution for non-oral piercings. Icing non-oral piercings can lead to tissue damage and a delay in the healing process. When the piercing is in an area with reduced blood flow, applying ice directly to the wound can cause the tissues to become excessively cold, making them prone to frostbite and irreversible damage. However, if your piercer approves and the ice is only applied for short periods (no more than 10-15 minutes), it may be helpful in soothing the discomfort and reducing inflammation. If you do decide to use ice, always wrap it in a clean cloth or a ziplock bag to create a barrier between your skin and the ice to avoid any skin damage. Conclusion Proper aftercare is crucial for ensuring the long-term success of your piercing. When done correctly, techniques like chamomile tea compresses and cold food and drinks can provide significant relief and expedite the healing process while minimizing adverse side effects. However, always consult with your piercing professional before trying any new aftercare techniques, especially when it comes to the use of ice on non-oral piercings. By prioritizing healing and safety through these natural remedies, you'll be on the path to enjoying your beautiful, adorned body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dame Helen Lydia Mirren,  (nee Mironoff; born 26 July 1945) is an English actor. Mirren began her acting career with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1967, and is one of the few performers who have achieved the Triple Crown of Acting. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2007 for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen and received the Olivier Award for Best Actress and Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the same role in The Audience. Mirren's other Academy Award nominations include The Madness of King George (1994), Gosford Park (2001) and The Last Station (2009). Mirren's first film of the 2000s was Joel Hershman's Greenfingers (2000), a comedy based on the true story about the award-winning prisoners of HMP Leyhill, a minimum-security prison. Mirren portrayed a devoted plantswoman in the film, who coaches a team of prison gardeners, led by Clive Owen, to victory at a prestigious flower show. The project garnered largely lukewarm reviews from critics, who felt that it added \\"nothing new to this already saturated genre\\" of British feel-good films. The same year, she began work on the mystery film The Pledge, actor Sean Penn's second directorial effort, in which she played a child psychologist. A critical success, the ensemble film tanked at the box office. Also the year, she filmed the American-Icelandic satirical drama No Such Thing opposite Sarah Polley. Directed by Hal Hartley, Mirren portrayed a soulless television producer in the film, who strives for sensationalistic stories. It was largely panned by critics.  Her biggest critical and commercial success, released in 2001, became Robert Altman's all-star ensemble mystery film Gosford Park. An homage to writer Agatha Christie's whodunit style, the story follows a party of wealthy Britons and an American, and their servants, who gather for a shooting weekend at an English country house, resulting in an unexpected murder. Widely acclaimed by critics, it received multiple awards and nominations, including a second Academy Award nomination and first Screen Actors Guild Award win for Mirren's portrayal of the sternly devoted head servant Mrs. Wilson. Mirren's last film that year was Fred Schepisi's dramedy film Last Orders opposite Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins.  In 2003, Mirren starred in Nigel Cole's comedy Calendar Girls, inspired by the true story of a group of Yorkshire women who produced a nude calendar to raise money for Leukaemia Research under the auspices of the Women's Institutes. Mirren was initially resistant to join the project, at first dismissing it as another middling British picture, but rethought her decision upon learning of the casting of co-star Julie Walters. The film garnered generally positive reactions by film critics, and grossed 96,000,000 worldwide. In addition, the picture earned Satellite, Golden Globe, and European Film Award nominations for Mirren. Her other film that year was the Showtime television film The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone opposite Olivier Martinez, and Anne Bancroft, based on the 1950 novel of the same title by Tennessee Williams.","output":"This text is about Dame Helen Lydia Mirren, an English actor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least 70 years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me. Then, a little girl came toward him. I heard the child say, \\"Grandfather, may I polish   your shoes?\\" That old man took pity on her, smiled and gave her a shoe to polish. The girl told him she needed money to buy her brother a new school uniform. \\"Oh, little girl. Just stop doing this. Come with me and I will buy you a uniform.\\" Then they walked to a market , and he bought her brother a uniform. The girl said \\"thanks\\" to him and left, leaving the old man smiling. He walked away from the market, but I stopped him. I whispered in his ear, \\"You are a hero! Thank you for your kindness!\\"  As I walked away, I looked back and I could see him still smiling. I was blown away by the kindness I had just seen.  Someone who had so little was so generous! Amazing! My own sadness had completely disappeared, chased way by the light of this kind act. I began realizing that I have a lot to be thankful for. I hope, some day, I can show my appreciation   of what I have by following the example of the old man. He only had a little, but shared it so beautifully with someone who had nothing. Answer:","output":"Question: In the article, how does the old man help the little girl and what impact does this act of kindness have on the narrator?

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people that Carl tracks down for saving his life? , can you please find it?   In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl, whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a Book of Mormon.  Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious street preacher lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the man—later identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)—to rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days.  In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly—a struggling actress—acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result. Elder Farrell promises that God will never stop loving her regardless of her mistakes. At a local ward luau, another missionary interviews Carl for baptism, teaching him the story of Ammon, a missionary who teaches a group of people  to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again. The night before his baptism, Carl buries his weapons in the yard and Elder Lozano baptizes him the following day.

Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide  him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids.  Which liquid will have lower viscosity? Answer:","output":"Liquid B will have lower viscosity. Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow or its internal friction. It depends on the strength of the intermolecular forces between the fluid's molecules. Stronger intermolecular forces lead to greater resistance to flow, resulting in higher viscosity, while weaker intermolecular forces lead to less resistance to flow, resulting in lower viscosity. In Jacob's experiment, liquid A has strong intermolecular forces, which means the molecules are more firmly attracted to one another. This would cause liquid A to have a higher viscosity as the molecules resist flowing past one another. On the other hand, liquid B has weak intermolecular forces, which means the molecules do not hold together as tightly. This results in the molecules flowing more easily past each other, making liquid B have a lower viscosity. In summary, liquid B will have a lower viscosity due to its weaker intermolecular forces, allowing the molecules to flow more easily and with less resistance compared to liquid A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Turkey is a nation of farmers, they use conventional agricultural methods to produce food, including lots of fertilizers. Greece's economy is mostly based on tourism.  But I can use this background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  What is an answer for this question: Which country causes the entry into the sea of more potentially hazardous particles?","output":"Based on the given background information, it can be inferred that Turkey, with its agriculture-based economy and extensive use of fertilizers, would likely contribute more to the entry of potentially hazardous particles into the sea as compared to Greece, whose economy is primarily driven by tourism. Agricultural activities, such as the application of chemical fertilizers and animal waste, can lead to the release of excess nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, into rivers that eventually flow into the sea. These excess nutrients contribute to a process called eutrophication, which in turn can cause the growth of algal blooms and the depletion of oxygen in the water, resulting in a \\"dead zone\\" where marine life can't survive. On the other hand, Greece's tourism-based economy might cause some marine pollution in the form of litter, specifically from tourist activities along the coastlines and beaches. Although this is an issue that should not be overlooked, the overall impact of tourism-related pollution on the marine environment is comparatively less than that caused by the agricultural activities of Turkey. Hence, in this particular scenario, it is more likely that Turkey contributes to a higher entry of potentially hazardous particles into the sea than Greece does. However, it is essential to acknowledge that both countries may have other pollution sources and that constant efforts should be made to minimize pollution and its effects on the marine environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Texas is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population. Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares borders with the U.S. states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast.  - Henry Madison Morris ( October 6 , 1918 -- February 25 , 2006 ) was an American young Earth creationist , Christian apologist , and engineer . He was one of the founders of the Creation Research Society and the Institute for Creation Research . He is considered by many to be \`\` the father of modern creation science . '' He wrote numerous creationist and devotional books , and made regular television and radio appearances . As Morris believed in the inerrancy of the Bible , he opposed the billions - of - years time scales of evolution , the age of the Earth , and the age of the Universe that he saw as being contrary to it . Morris ' influential approach , while adopted widely by the modern creationist movement , continues to be rejected by the mainstream scientific community , as well as old Earth creationists and theistic evolutionists .  - Linguistics is the scientific study of language, and involves an analysis of language form, language meaning, and language in context. The earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 4th century BCE Indian grammarian Pini who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his \\"\\".  - Dallas is a major city in the state of Texas and is the largest urban center of the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the United States. The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat; however, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,300,092 as of July 1, 2015.  - Evolutionary biology is the subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth, starting from a single origin of life. These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation.  - The Creation Research Society (CRS) is a Christian research group that engages in creation science. The organization has produced various publications, including a journal and a creation-based biology textbook. During the first few years of its existence, different beliefs about Creationism and disagreement over its statement of beliefs resulted in various members of the board and voting members being forced out of the organization.  - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis.  - The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) is a Creationist apologetics institute in Dallas, Texas that specializes in media promotion of pseudoscientific creation science and interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative as a historical event. The ICR adopts the Bible as an inerrant and literal documentary of scientific and historical fact as well as religious and moral truths, and espouses a Young Earth creationist worldview. It rejects evolutionary biology, which it views as a corrupting moral and social influence and threat to religious belief. The ICR was formed by Henry M. Morris in 1972 following an organizational split with the Creation Science Research Center (CSRC).  - Creationism is the religious belief that the universe and life originated \\"from specific acts of divine creation,\\" as opposed to the scientific conclusion that they came about through natural processes. The first use of the term \\"creationist\\" to describe a proponent of creationism is found in an 1856 letter of Charles Darwin describing those who objected on religious grounds to the emerging science of evolution.   - Creation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that claims to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and disprove or reexplain the scientific facts, theories and scientific paradigms about geology, cosmology, biological evolution, archeology, history, and linguistics.  - Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms, and molecules.  - The Book of Genesis (from the Latin Vulgate, in turn borrowed or transliterated from Greek , meaning \\"origin\\" \\"Brš\\", \\"In [the] beginning\\") is the first book of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament.  - Geology (from the Ancient Greek , \\"g\\", i.e. \\"earth\\" and -o, \\"-logia\\", i.e. \\"study of, discourse\\") is an earth science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change. Geology can also refer generally to the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet (such as the geology of the Moon or Mars).  - The Genesis creation narrative is the creation myth of both Judaism and Christianity. It is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the first two chapters of the Book of Genesis. In the first Elohim, the Hebrew generic plural word for God, creates the heavens and the earth in six days, starting with light on the first day and ending with mankind on the sixth, then rests on, blesses and sanctifies the seventh. In the second story, God, now referred to by the personal name Yahweh, creates Adam, the first man, from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden, where he is given dominion over the animals. Eve, the first woman, is created from Adam's rib as a companion.  - Cosmology (from the Greek , \\"kosmos\\" \\"world\\" and -, \\"-logia\\" \\"study of\\") is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which researcher read less about adding water to the mantle?  Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.","output":"Based on the information provided, Clint, who studied mantle melting, would have read more about adding water to the mantle. This is because mantle melting can come about through three ways, including adding water to the mantle (as mentioned in hint 3), which lowers the melting point.

Premise: \\"The oldest and most authentic Yemenite restaurant in town, serving excellent mellawachs (pancakes).\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The best place to eat superb pancakes is at the oldest Yemenite restaurant.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it can be concluded that the oldest and most authentic Yemenite restaurant in town serves excellent mellawachs (pancakes). However, claiming that it is the best place to eat superb pancakes warrants further examination. First, let's understand the premise in detail: 1. The Yemenite restaurant is the oldest in town: This means it has been in existence for a considerable period, which may hint at consistent quality, customer satisfaction, and a strong understanding of traditional Yemenite cuisine. This factor can contribute positively to the quality of pancakes served. 2. The restaurant is described as authentic: Authenticity suggests that the restaurant may adhere to traditional Yemenite cooking methods and ingredients, leading to a genuine and unique taste. This is an important aspect when considering the quality of pancakes since authentic Yemenite pancakes may be perceived as superior to hybrid or convenient adaptations of the dish. 3. The pancake, or mellawach, is described as excellent: In light of the premise, we can deduce that the mellawachs served at this particular restaurant are not only considered authentic Yemenite cuisine but also of high quality. Nevertheless, to affirm the hypothesis that \\"The best place to eat superb pancakes is at the oldest Yemenite restaurant,\\" several factors must be explored further: 1. Type of pancakes: The hypothesis refers to \\"pancakes\\" in general, encompassing a wide variety of types and styles of pancakes, such as American, French, and other nationalities' variations. However, Yemenite mellawachs represent a distinct type of pancake. Therefore, the hypothesis may not hold true for those seeking non-Yemenite pancake experiences. 2. Subjective tastes: Personal preferences and tastes can significantly determine the perception of \\"the best place to eat superb pancakes.\\" What one individual finds superb, another might not. Preferences can stem from factors like texture, flavor, and presentation, as well as dietary restrictions or cultural backgrounds. 3. Competition and local alternatives: The premise tells us that this restaurant is the oldest and most authentic Yemenite restaurant in town. It does not provide information on how many other Yemenite restaurants or pancake-serving establishments are within the vicinity. The quality and authenticity of these other establishments could be comparable or even superior to the mentioned Yemenite restaurant, depending on various factors such as ingredients, skilled chefs, and unique cooking methods. In conclusion, based on the premise, we can determine that the oldest and most authentic Yemenite restaurant in town serves excellent mellawachs. However, establishing the hypothesis \\"The best place to eat superb pancakes is at the oldest Yemenite restaurant\\" as true would require a more comprehensive analysis of personal tastes, different pancake variations, and competition from other establishments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Plans for a complete ban on catching wild salmon using coastal nets have been announced by the Scottish government.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Scottish Government Announces Complete Ban on Coastal Netting of Wild Salmon Introduction: The Scottish government has recently announced a comprehensive ban on the controversial practice of catching wild salmon using coastal nets. This policy comes as a response to concerns over the substantial decline in wild salmon populations and the potential long-term impact on ecosystems in the region. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this decision and its possible effects on the fishing industry and the environment. Reason for the ban: The primary reason behind this ban is the dwindling numbers of wild salmon in Scottish waters. According to various studies, the wild salmon population has seen a significant decline in recent years, with numbers dropping by as much as 50% in some areas. This rapid decline has raised alarm among environmentalists and conservationists who believe that the overfishing and catching methods employed by the coastal netting industry contribute to the problem. Impact on the fishing industry: The ban on coastal netting is expected to have a substantial impact on the salmon fishing industry. Many fishermen rely on this method to catch wild salmon, which is an essential source of income for them and their families. However, the government has acknowledged the potential hardships that fishermen might face due to the ban and have promised to develop a compensation plan for those affected. Environmental benefits: Banning coastal netting will not only help in conserving the wild salmon population but will also have a positive impact on the overall ecosystem. As wild salmon are an essential part of the food chain, their diminished numbers affect other marine species and can potentially lead to the collapse of the entire aquatic system. By enforcing the ban, the Scottish government aims to improve the overall health of the marine environment and restore balance to the ecosystem. Potential challenges: While the ban serves as a positive step towards the conservation of wild salmon and the protection of vulnerable ecosystems, some challenges need to be addressed. It is crucial to monitor and enforce the ban effectively, as illegal fishing activities can still pose a threat to wild salmon populations. Moreover, the fishing industry must adapt to alternative methods that are more sustainable and less harmful to the environment. Conclusion: The decision of the Scottish government to ban coastal netting in an effort to conserve wild salmon populations is a commendable move. While there will be potential challenges and adjustments for the fishing industry, the long-term environmental benefits outweigh these initial difficulties. By taking this step, Scotland demonstrates a commitment to protecting its natural resources, preserving the marine environment, and ensuring a sustainable future for its fishing communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the given sentence, each word has a clear meaning and contributes to the overall message. \\"David\\" is a name that represents a person, \\"broke\\" conveys a sense of damage, \\"the window\\" refers to a specific object being affected, and \\"with a hammer\\" provides information about the tool used to perform the action. Together, these words create a coherent sentence that effectively communicates a comprehensible idea. 3. Context: A linguist would also evaluate the sentence based on its potential context. In this case, the sentence could easily fit into a narrative about an event that occurred, a description of a scene, or other related contexts. It provides a clear and concise piece of information that helps the reader understand an action that took place involving David and the window. Since the sentence is versatile and can easily be understood in various situational contexts, it is considered acceptable linguistically. 4. Morphology: Morphology pertains to the smallest units of meaning in a language, called morphemes. In \\"David broke the window with a hammer.\\", words form different morphemes: \\"David\\" is a single morpheme, \\"broke\\" is the past form of the verb \\"break\\" created by adding the morpheme \\"-d,\\" and \\"hammer\\" can be further divided into the base morpheme \\"hamm-\\" (tool part) and the \\"-er\\" morpheme indicating the one who uses a tool. The sentence adheres to morphological rules, as its components are combined correctly. 5. Multifaceted examination: A linguist doesn't solely focus on one aspect of language but rather examines its different components. The sentence \\"David broke the window with a hammer.\\" satisfies not only the syntactic and semantic perspectives, but it also maintains conciseness and clarity. Moreover, it respects the phonological (sound patterns) and pragmatic (appropriate use) rules of the English language. In conclusion, as the sentence maintains the syntactic, semantic, contextual, morphological, and multifaceted examination requirements, a linguist would indeed consider \\"David broke the window with a hammer.\\" an acceptable sentence linguistically."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Short movie review: the excruciating end  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"From the given information, it can be concluded that the critic had a negative perception of the movie. The title \\"The Excruciating End\\" suggests that the movie's end was extremely painful or uncomfortable to watch, indicating dissatisfaction. The word 'excruciating' itself has strong negative connotations and triggers a sense of displeasure or aversion. However, to give a complete analysis, it is essential to understand the critic's full opinion, including their thoughts on the plot, characters, and overall movie experience. A more thorough analysis of the critic's viewpoint might include evaluating their comments on the movie's storyline, pacing, character development, and production qualities such as cinematography, sound design, and acting performances. If the critic's issues are primarily focused on the ending, then it is possible that they found aspects of the movie enjoyable or engaging. However, an unsatisfactory or poorly executed conclusion can significantly impact a critic's overall rating, leaving them with a lasting impression of disappointment. For instance, the critic may have appreciated the movie's stunning visuals or engrossing performances from the lead actors but found the narrative resolution to be unsatisfying, rushed, or nonsensical. This could result in a negative review despite the positive aspects of the film. On the other hand, if the critic's assessment thoroughly critiques other aspects of the movie – such as a weak script, flat characters, or poor pacing – the title's emphasis on \\"The Excruciating End\\" would indicate that the movie's conclusion was an additional significant issue, reinforcing their adverse view of the film. In conclusion, the critic's title choice suggests that they had a negative opinion of the movie, mainly due to its ending. However, it is crucial to examine the full review to understand the extent of their dissatisfaction and the specific aspects of the movie that contributed to their negative impression. By doing so, we can more accurately evaluate the critic's perspective and determine whether it aligns with broader audience opinions or diverges from the general consensus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Magma rises from deep in the earth - The magma goes into volcanos - The volcanos pressure the magma upwards - The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano - The lava cools - The lava forms new rock - New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano - The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption.  Question: suppose freezing rain cools down the air happens, how will it affect lava stays at a lower temperature.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The process of a volcano going through an eruption cycle involves multiple stages: magma rising from deep within the earth goes into volcanoes, the immense pressure from the volcano forces the magma upwards, piercing through the surface and entering the atmosphere as lava. Subsequently, the lava cools and solidifies, forming new rock. A new batch of magma then rises, applying pressure to the surface of the volcano, and eventually bursting through the rock formed after the last eruption cycle.  The question asks about the impact of an introduction of freezing rain, which would effectively lower the air temperature in the region, on the cooling process of the lava and how it would affect ensuing volcanic cycles.  The answer to that is complex, as various factors are at play here. Predicting exactly what might happen can be challenging, but some educated speculations can be provided.  The cooling of lava into rock is partially influenced by the rate at which heat can be removed from the lava flow. This is largely a function of the lava's surface area exposed to the cooling environment and the temperature differential between the molten rock and the surrounding air.  If freezing rain were to occur, causing a drop in atmospheric temperature, this could theoretically cool the lava faster. The precipitation coming into contact with the lava would likely evaporate on contact and carry away additional heat, increasing the rate at which the lava loses its thermal energy. As a result, we would expect that, all else being equal, the lava would solidify more quickly. In terms of the second effect mentioned – new magma rising and putting pressure on the volcano’s surface – the impact of faster cooling above-ground lava is twofold and slightly contradictory. On one hand, if the lava hardens more quickly due to the cooling effect of the freezing rain, this could create a thicker and stronger layer of new rock on the surface in less time. This could potentially cause a greater resistance to the pressure from the new magma, delaying or even mitigating the subsequent eruption. In this sense, freezing rain could have a considerable \\"more effect\\" on the second phase mentioned. On the other hand, the speed of lava hardening does not necessarily affect the generation and movement of magma deep below the surface. These processes are driven by geological forces far beneath where surface temperatures can reach. Even if the lava at the surface cools faster, it may not significantly affect these deeper processes. Therefore, it could also be argued that freezing rain might cause \\"no effect\\" on the magma pressure build-up phase. In conclusion, while freezing rain and lower temperatures may increase the rate at which lava cools and hardens into new rock, its potential effect on the second phase of the volcanic cycle is ambiguous due to a plethora of factors, with some hinting at a greater effect and others suggesting no effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Recognize the severity of a collapsed vein. Ask a medical professional about supplements that may help. Anticipate medication or surgery. Article:","output":"Title: Understanding Collapsed Veins: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments Introduction Collapsed veins are a serious medical condition that can result in various health complications. It's important to recognize the severity of a collapsed vein and seek professional medical advice for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. This article will help you better understand the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for collapsed veins. Causes of Collapsed Veins Collapsed veins occur when the walls of a vein become weak and collapse under pressure. This can be caused by various factors such as: 1. Chronic use of intravenous (IV) drugs: Repeatedly injecting substances into the veins can damage and weaken the vein walls, leading to their collapse. 2. Trauma or injury: Accidents or surgical procedures that damage the veins can lead to their collapse. 3. Blood clot formation: Blood clots that block the flow of blood through a vein can cause the vein to collapse. 4. Infections: Infections in the bloodstream can weaken or inflame the vein walls, causing them to collapse. 5. Aging: As one ages, the strength and elasticity of the vein walls tend to decrease, increasing the chances of a collapse. Symptoms of Collapsed Veins Some common symptoms associated with collapsed veins are: 1. Pain and swelling in the affected area 2. Darkening of the skin (discoloration or bruising) 3. Difficulty drawing blood or inserting an IV 4. A lump or bulge along the vein 5. Warmth or tenderness around the affected vein When you recognize any of these symptoms, it is important to consult a medical professional to avoid further complications and receive appropriate treatment. Treatment and Prevention Collapsed veins may sometimes heal on their own, but in severe cases, medical intervention is necessary. Once you consult a medical professional, they may suggest various treatments, such as: 1. Supplements: Your doctor may recommend specific supplements that may help strengthen the veins and alleviate symptoms. 2. Medication: Medications may be prescribed to alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, or manage any underlying issues causing the collapse, such as blood clots or infections. 3. Surgery: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to repair the damaged veins or remove any obstructions caused by blood clots. 4. Lifestyle changes: Adopting a healthy lifestyle, avoiding IV drug use, and exercising regularly can help prevent future problems with collapsed veins. Conclusion It is essential to recognize the severity of a collapsed vein and consult a medical professional immediately upon noticing symptoms. Early intervention and treatment can prevent further complications and help you maintain good vascular health. If you are concerned about your vein health, speak with your healthcare provider to discuss your options and the most suitable course of treatment for your individual case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: What are some ways to lose weight fast? Question 2: What is the best way to be in a calorie deficit and lose weight successfully? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Although the core principle behind losing weight fast and being in a calorie deficit to lose weight successfully is the same, namely consuming fewer calories than you burn, the specific methods and approaches to achieve these goals could be different. Here is a detailed answer for both questions: Question 1: What are some ways to lose weight fast? 1. Intermittent fasting: Intermittent fasting entails alternating between periods of fasting and eating. Common patterns include the 16/8 method (eating within an 8-hour window and fasting for 16 hours) and the 5:2 method (consuming only 500-600 calories on two non-consecutive days per week). 2. High-intensity interval training (HIIT): HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief rest periods. This type of training is efficient, burns calories rapidly, and boosts metabolism even after the workout is over. 3. Reduce carbohydrate intake: Lowering your carb intake can induce ketosis, leading your body to burn fat as a primary fuel source. This can result in rapid weight loss, albeit some of it being water weight. 4. Increase protein consumption: Eating more protein can help you feel full longer, increase your metabolic rate, and reduce caloric intake. 5. Drink more water: Drinking water before meals can reduce appetite and help with portion control. Staying well-hydrated also supports metabolic processes in the body. 6. Eliminate added sugars and processed foods: Cutting out high-calorie, low-nutrient foods can help you reduce your overall caloric intake. 7. Get enough sleep: Poor sleep has been linked to weight gain and obesity. Ensure you get 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support healthier weight loss. 8. Manage stress: High stress levels can contribute to weight gain due to increased cortisol production. Incorporate stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and exercise to maintain a healthy weight. Question 2: What is the best way to be in a calorie deficit and lose weight successfully? 1. Calculate your calorie needs: Determine your daily caloric needs based on age, sex, height, weight, and activity level. This will help you establish the amount of calories you need to maintain your current weight. To create a calorie deficit, consume 500-1000 calories less than your maintenance level. 2. Consume nutrient-dense foods: Opt for whole, unprocessed foods that are high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, while low in calories. These include vegetables, lean protein sources, whole grains, and healthy fats. 3. Monitor portion sizes: Avoid overeating by using smaller plates, weighing your food, or utilizing portion control tools. 4. Regular exercise: Engage in both aerobic and resistance training for balanced weight loss and muscle strength. Aim to exercise at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, plus resistance training on at least two days per week. 5. Allow for flexibility: Understand that weight loss is a gradual process and slip-ups will occur. Embrace flexibility and don't be too hard on yourself. This helps to maintain motivation and encourages long-term adherence to healthier habits. 6. Set realistic goals: Aim to lose 1-2 pounds per week, which is considered safe and sustainable weight loss. 7. Get support: Share your goal with friends, family, or an online support group. Having a support network can help keep you motivated and accountable. While both questions involve weight loss through calorie reduction, the approaches can be different. Losing weight fast might include more aggressive measures, while adopting a calorie deficit is typically associated with a more gradual, sustainable process. It is essential to consult a medical professional or registered dietitian before beginning any weight loss plan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Hugo Christiaan Hamaker ( 23 March 1905 , Broek op Langedijk , North Holland -- 7 September 1993 , Eindhoven ) was a Dutch scientist , who was responsible for the Hamaker theory which explains the van der Waals forces between objects larger than molecules . His 1937 paper was heavily cited . He completed his doctorate at the Universiteit Utrecht in 1934 . His dissertation was labelled : Reflectivity and Emissivity of Tungsten ; with a Description of a New Method to Determine the Total Reflectivity of Any Surface in a Simple and Accurate Way . His adviser was Leonard Ornstein . From 1934 to 1967 he was employed in the Physical Laboratory of Philips in Eindhoven , and from 1960 to 1972 he was Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology .  - After the explanation of van der Waals forces by Fritz London several scientists soon realised that his definition could be extended from the interaction of two molecules with induced dipoles to macro-scale objects by summing all of the forces between the molecules in each of the bodies involved. The theory is named after H. C. Hamaker who derived the interaction between two spheres, a sphere and a wall, and presented a general discussion in a heavily cited 1937 paper.  - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - The Dommel is a stream in Belgium and the Netherlands, left tributary of the Dieze. It rises in north-eastern Belgium near Peer and flows into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at 's-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel's course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and 's-Hertogenbosch. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area called the Dommelbeemden.  - Fritz Wolfgang London (March 7, 1900  March 30, 1954) was a Jewish-German physicist and professor at Duke University. His fundamental contributions to the theories of chemical bonding and of intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces) are today considered classic and are discussed in standard textbooks of physical chemistry. With his brother Heinz London, he made a significant contribution to understanding electromagnetic properties of superconductors with the London equations and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on five separate occasions.   - Friesland (official) or Frisia is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the North Sea. In 2010, the province had a population of 646,000 and a total area of .  - Broek op Langedijk (West Frisian: \\"Broek op Lengedìk\\") is a town in the Netherlands, located in the municipality of Langedijk in the province of North Holland.  - North Holland (, West Frisian: \\"Noard-Holland\\") is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated on the North Sea, north of South Holland and Utrecht, and west of Friesland and Flevoland. As of 2015, it has a population of 2,762,163 and a total area of .  - In physical chemistry, the van der Waals forces (or van der Waals interaction), named after Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals, are the residual attractive or repulsive forces between molecules or atomic groups that do not arise from covalent bonds, nor ionic bonds. It can be shown that van der Waals forces are of the same origin as the Casimir effect, arising from quantum interactions with the zero-point field.

The Gender was dammed short of the city centre in the 1950s and the Dommel still runs through the city. The city has a population of 223,220 in January 2015, making it the fifth-largest municipality of the Netherlands and the largest in the province of North Brabant.  - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse (Maas) river westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the RhineMeuseScheldt delta. History. The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands.  Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794.  - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".

Indigenous peoples of Mexico (Spanish: pueblos indigenas de Mexico), Native Mexicans (Spanish: nativos mexicanos), or Mexican Native Americans (Spanish: nativo america mexicanos), are those who are part of communities that trace their roots back to populations and communities that existed in what is now Mexico prior to the arrival of Europeans. According to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comision Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indigenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (official census institute), in 2015, 25,694,928 people in Mexico self-identify as being indigenous of many different ethnic groups, which constitute 21.5% of Mexico's population. According to the National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples (CDI), there were 25,694,928 indigenous people reported in Mexico in 2015, which constitutes 21.5% of the population of Mexico. This is a significant increase from the 2010 census, in which indigenous Mexicans accounted for 14.9% of the population, and numbered 15,700,000 Most indigenous communities have a degree of financial, political autonomy under the legislation of \\"usos y costumbres\\", which allows them to regulate internal issues under customary law.  The indigenous population of Mexico has in recent decades increased both in absolute numbers as-well as a percentage of the population. This is largely due to increased self-identification as indigenous, as-well as indigenous women having higher birth rates as compared to the Mexican average. Indigenous peoples are more likely to live in more rural areas, than the Mexican average, but many do reside in urban or suburban areas, particularly, in the central states of Mexico, Puebla, Tlaxcala, the Federal District and the Yucatan Peninsula.  According to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are: Yucatan, with 65.40%, Quintana Roo with 44.44% and Campeche with 44.54% of the population being indigenous, most of them Maya; Oaxaca with 65.73% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas has 36.15%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo with 36.21%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla with 35.28%, and Guerrero with 33.92%, mostly Nahua people and the states of San Luis Potosi and Veracruz both home to a population of 19% indigenous people, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups.

Answer:","output":"The emotions of an individual can greatly vary depending on various factors, including their relationship to the subject and the circumstances surrounding the situation. However, since the context isn't fully explained, I'll consider a few possible scenarios.  1. If Aubrey and Robin are inanimate objects or collectables (like dolls, toys, etc.), Aubrey might not have any specific feeling unless these items held sentimental value. If they did, Aubrey might feel a degree of sadness or regret after selling Robin. 2. If Robin is a pet and Aubrey is a person, Aubrey might feel guilty or sad, especially knowing she sold Robin to a 'mean old man'. This situation could lead Aubrey to worry about Robin's welfare. 3. If Robin is a character in a digital medium (like a video game character), Aubrey might feel a sense of accomplishment or profit, especially if the sale was beneficial. However, knowing the buyer's 'mean' personality might create feelings of regret or worry. In all scenarios, any feelings Aubrey might have would be dependent on their personality, their attachment to Robin, and their sensitivity to the perceived personality of the buyer. If Aubrey is typically empathetic and caring, knowing the buyer is 'mean' might create stronger negative emotions than if Aubrey is generally unemotional or motivated primarily by profit."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: A group of islands, such as the Galapagos are generally called a? Context: Scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \\"law of development\\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.

In 1995, a studio version of the recording, incorporating contributions from Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, was released as a single by the Beatles. It was released 25 years after the break-up of the band and 15 years after the death of Lennon. The single was released as part of the promotion for The Beatles Anthology video documentary and the band's Anthology 1 compilation album. McCartney, Harrison and Starr originally intended to record some incidental background music, as a trio, for the Anthology project, but later realised, according to Starr, that they wanted to record \\"new music\\". According to Harrison, they had always agreed that if one of them was not in the band, the others would never replace them and, \\"... go out as the Beatles\\", and that the \\"only other person that could be in it was John.\\"  McCartney then asked Ono if she had any unreleased recordings by Lennon, so she sent him cassette tapes of four songs. \\"Free as a Bird\\" was recorded by Lennon in 1977, in his and Ono's Dakota building apartment in New York City, but was not complete. Lennon introduced the song on the cassette by imitating a New York accent and saying, \\"Free--as a boid\\" (bird). The other songs were \\"Grow Old With Me\\", \\"Real Love\\", and \\"Now and Then\\". Ono says that it was Harrison and former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall who initially asked her about the concept of adding vocals and instrumentation to Lennon's demo tapes. Ono stated: \\"People have said it was all agreed when Paul came over to New York to induct John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but it was all settled before then. I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul.\\"  McCartney went to Ono's home after the induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to listen to, and receive, the Lennon demo tapes; he recalls the meeting with Ono:  She was there with Sean ... and she played us a couple of tracks. There were two newies on mono cassettes which he did at home ... [s]o I checked it out with Sean, because I didn't want him to have a problem with it. He said, \\"Well, it'll be weird hearing a dead guy on lead vocal. But give it a try.\\" I said to them both, \\"If it doesn't work out, you can veto it.\\" When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that they were going, \\"What? What if we love it?\\" It didn't come to that, luckily. I said to Yoko, \\"Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out. So don't put any conditions, it's tough enough.\\"  During an interview for the Anthology project, McCartney revealed that he was surprised to learn that Lennon's demos of \\"Grow Old With Me\\" and \\"Real Love\\" had already been released and were well known by Lennon fans. Starr admitted that when he first listened to the recording he found it very emotional.

Process:  - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate changes happens, how will it affect MORE sedimentary rock forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this context, suggests that climate change could have a potential impact on the process of sedimentary rock formation. Climate change may affect the process both directly and indirectly through various mechanisms, ultimately influencing the amount and characteristics of sedimentary rocks. 1. Direct effects on erosion: Climate change can significantly alter patterns of precipitation, temperature, and storm frequency. Increased precipitation, for example, can lead to enhanced erosion rates, resulting in more sediment being detached from rocks and transported to new locations. Warmer temperatures can also cause permafrost to melt, releasing large amounts of previously trapped sediments. Additionally, more intense and frequent storms can increase erosion caused by wind and water, further contributing to sediment transport. 2. Indirect effects on erosion: Climate change can also indirectly affect erosion and sediment transport through its impact on vegetation. Warmer temperatures may lead to the migration or extinction of certain plant species which have the potential to destabilize landscapes. This destabilization could ultimately result in increased erosion rates. 3. Sediment transport and deposition: Climate change can also influence sediment transport rates and deposition. As precipitation patterns shift, so too does the movement of water carrying sediment. This shift in water availability can change the locations and rates of sediment deposition. For instance, decreased river flow may result in less sediment being carried and deposited downstream, while increased river flow could lead to greater sediment deposition in existing areas. Furthermore, rising sea levels caused by global warming may create new areas for sedimentary rock formation. 4. Rate of compaction and lithification: The rate at which sediment becomes sedimentary rock may also be affected by climate change. In colder climates, compaction of sediment may occur at a slower rate due to extended periods of freezing conditions. However, as temperatures rise, this process could be accelerated, allowing for faster sediment compaction and lithification, ultimately leading to the formation of sedimentary rocks. 5. Changes in sediment composition: Climate change can also impact the composition of sediments and, consequently, the types of sedimentary rocks that form. Increased weathering and erosion will lead to an increased input of weathered material into the sedimentary system. Because minerals with certain properties may be more susceptible to weathering, this could cause changes in sediment mineralogy and impact the chemical composition of sedimentary rocks over time. In conclusion, climate change has the potential to significantly impact the formation of sedimentary rocks, both directly and indirectly. This can result in changes to erosion rates, sediment transport and deposition, lithification, and the chemical composition of sediments. Understanding these implications is essential for the comprehensive study of Earth's past and present processes and predicting future geological transformations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Question: Many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter this sort of building. What is it?  Choices:  - school - public building - large building - auditorum - convention center  The rationale to choose \\"public building\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The answer \\"public building\\" is the most appropriate choice among the options provided because it best suits the description given in the question. An entrance hall typically refers to a larger, open space where people can enter and exit a building, and it often serves as a welcoming and transitional area for visitors.  While all the other options (school, large building, auditorium, and convention center) may have entrance halls, they are more specific types of buildings and do not encapsulate the wide range of possibilities that the term \\"public building\\" encompasses.  The rationale for choosing \\"public building\\" is based on the following points: 1. Inclusiveness: Public buildings can include a variety of structures such as schools, government offices, libraries, museums, and other spaces that are accessible to the general public. By choosing \\"public building,\\" we acknowledge that an entrance hall could be a part of multiple types of buildings that are open and accessible to random citizens. 2. Accessibility: Public buildings are typically designed to allow easy access for all members of the community, and an entrance hall can often be a prominent feature to facilitate this access. The statement \\"Many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter this sort of building\\" implies that the building should accommodate a diverse group of people, which is the primary purpose of a public building. 3. Cultural and social significance: Public buildings hold significant importance in communities as they offer services and spaces where individuals can come together, learn, and access resources. An entrance hall in a public building sets the tone for the building's purpose and creates an inviting atmosphere for the random citizens that visit. In summary, the answer \\"public building\\" is the best choice considering the question's context and the wide range of structures it can refer to. This choice effectively captures the essence of a space that is accessible, welcoming, and frequently visited by random citizens."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Scott Pruitt  Declares War on Wind and Solar Energy  While Fossil Fuels Get Billions in Subsidies  Scott Pruitt  speaking at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor  Maryland  on February 25  2017. Photo Credit:  Gage Skidmore/Flickr Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt  recently proposed eliminating federal tax credits for wind and solar power  arguing that  they  should âstand on  their  own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sourcesâ as opposed to âbeing propped up by tax incentives and other types of credits....â Stand on  their  own?  Pruitt  surely must be aware that fossil fuels have been feasting at the government trough for at least 100 years. Renewables  by comparison  have received support only since the mid-1990s and  until recently  have had to subsist on scraps. Perhaps a review of the facts can set  Administrator Pruitt  straight. Thereâs a strong case to be made that Congress should terminate subsidies for fossil fuels and extend them for renewables  not the other way around. A new study by Oil Change International brings us up-to-date. Published earlier this month  it found that federal subsidies in 2015 and 2016 averaged 10.9 billion a year for the oil and gas industry and 3.8 billion for the coal industry. By contrast  the wind industryâs so-called production tax credit  renewed by Congress in December 2015  amounted to 3.3 billion last year  according to a Congress Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate. Unlike the fossil fuel industryâs permanent subsidies  Congress has allowed the wind tax credit to expire six times in the last 20 years  and  it  is now set to decline incrementally until ending in 2020. Similarly  Congress fixed the solar industryâs investment tax credit at 30 percent of a projectâs cost through 2019  but reduced  it  to 10 percent for commercial projects and zeroed  it  out for residences by the end of 2021. The JCT estimates that the solar credit amounted to a 2.4-billion tax break last year. Totaling it up  fossil fuels â at 14.7 billion â still received two-and-a-half times more in federal support than solar and wind in 2016.","output":"The task asks you to verify if the given sentiment towards an entity in the document is correct or not.

The champions are selected by the Goblet of Fire: Cedric Diggory of Hufflepuff is chosen to represent Hogwarts, Viktor Krum will represent Durmstrang Institute, and Fleur Delacour will represent Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. The Goblet unexpectedly chooses a fourth champion: Harry Potter. Dumbfounded, Dumbledore is unable to pull the underage Harry out of the tournament, as the Ministry official Barty Crouch Sr. insists that the champions are bound by a contract, and therefore, Harry is invited to compete. This makes Harry's best friend Ron Weasley jealous of him. For the tournament's first task, the champions must each retrieve a golden egg guarded by a dragon. Harry succeeds after he summons his broomstick to retrieve the egg, which contains information about the second challenge. Shortly after, another event known as the Yule Ball dance takes place, during which Harry's crush Cho Chang attends with Cedric, and Hermione Granger attends with Viktor, which makes Ron jealous of Viktor. During the second task, the champions are instructed to dive underwater to rescue their mates. Harry comes out in 3rd place but is placed second behind Cedric due to his \\"moral fiber\\". Afterwards, Barty Crouch Sr. is found dead by Harry. Harry visits Dumbledore at his office, and while waiting for him, he discovers a Pensieve,...

A station wagon drives into town. Young Charlie Brown (Gary Crutcher) tells the townsfolk that the sheriff will be bringing the body into town. There have been other incidents involving livestock. His sister, Ann Brown (Jolene Brand) nods in agreement. The incidents seem to be localized to Devil's Crag. Sheriff Parker (Bob Steele) pulls up in a pickup truck. Parker explains that \\"The coroner's report shows Banks died of a brutal beating at the hands of a person or persons unknown.\\" The Café Owner (Oliver Blake) pulls back the tarp covering the body. Ann, and other others, recoil in revulsion. Some of the townsfolk think the goings on are supernatural. A man reminds Ann of the legend of the curse. Another tells Ann to talk to some of the Indians that still populate the town. A well inebriated Indian Joe (Billy Dix) sitting on the stoop of the bait and tackle shop giggles and warns, \\"All white men die.\\" He then laughs maniacally. The Sheriff asks Joe is he knows anything about the death of Banks. Joe is annoyed that the white men think he's crazy. Joe reluctantly leaves town, but first warns the sheriff, \\"People who walk on Indian grave die.\\" The sheriff puts Devil's Crag off limits. He plans to ask everyone where they were the night before. One of the men suggests he start with Wayne Brooks as he had another run in with Banks and was run off the Banks' property with a shotgun. Wayne Brooks (Ed Kemmer) wanders into town after three days in the woods. Charlie and Ann tell him about the death of Harold Banks. Wayne walks over to talk to the sheriff. Sheriff Parker asks Wayne about the murder and his whereabouts. Wayne tells him he was up in the mountains collecting rock specimens. Wayne admits to crossing the Banks property a week before.

Desperate to avoid paying overdue rent, Mark continually eludes landlord Jack, meaning he is also unable to inform Jack of the flat's dilapidated state. Discovering that Mark wasted money meant for the overdue rent, Sally finally decides to end her strained relationship with Mark, informs Jack of the repairs needed, and arranges to move out. The damaged state of the flat reaching its peak, Mark witnesses two consecutive freak accidents; a bookshelf falls and kills his dog, and the living room chandelier collapses and crushes David. Reeling in horror from the events, Mark looks on as Jack appears to repair a high lightbulb atop a wobbly stool, only to fall and pierce his throat with his screwdriver. Pierce then arrives and discovers the corpses, causing him to panic. Hiding in the bathroom, Mark and Pierce plot to control the situation, only for Sally to return. Discovering David's body, Sally faints and impales herself on Mark's clarinet stand, killing her too.

Here, Sportsmail gives you a round-up of the other Euro 2016 qualifying matches from around Europe. Alexandru Epureanu's header earned Moldova a surprise 1-1 draw with Russia in Moscow, paving the way for Austria to take the top spot in their European Championship qualifying group. Russia struggled to break down a dogged Moldovan defence until the 73rd minute, when Artyom Dzyuba earned and converted a penalty following a foul by Victor Golovatenco. Moldova responded within seconds of the restart as Epureanu headed home from Alexander Dedov's corner. Russia suffered a disappointing 1-1 draw with Moldova, with Austria moving above them in the group. Rubin Okotie scored the only goal of the game as Austria beat Montenegro 1-0 in Vienna. Estonia 0-1 England. Austria 1- Montenegro. Russia 1-1 Moldova. Ukraine 1-0 Macedonia. Belarus 1-3 Slovakia. Lithuania 0-2 Slovenia. Luxembourg 0-4 Spain. Sweden 2-0 Lichtenstein. Midfielder Serhiy Sydorchuk scored on his full international debut to help Ukraine edge Macedonia 1-0 in their Euro 2016 Group C qualifier. Sydorchuk, on target as a substitute in the 2-0 win away to neighbours Belarus on Thursday, finished off a swift counter-attack in added time at the end of the first half. The speedy Evgeny Konoplyanka created the goal with a cross to the far post with Sydorchuk arriving to fire in from close range. In Vienna, the Pakistan-born, half-Nigerian Rubin Okotie's 24th-minute goal won the game for Austria against a flat Montenegro side. Montenegro went into the qualifying group with hopes of reaching Euro 2016, but had already been struggling after an opening win over Moldova was followed with a goalless draw against Liechtenstein last week. Ukraine's players head back to their own half after celebrating Serhiy Sydorchuk's goal. Diego Costa fluffed his lines in the first half, but the Chelsea forward did eventually get on the scoresheet. Diego Costa ended his long international scoring drought with the third goal in an uninspiring 4-0 win for Spain away to minnows Luxembourg in Euro 2016 qualifying Group C on Sunday. Brazil-born Costa had failed to find the net for his adopted country in six previous appearances but broke a duck lasting more than 500 minutes when he netted from close range in the 69th minute in a rain-lashed Luxembourg City. David Silva opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a fine long-range strike and set up Paco Alcacer to make it 2-0 three minutes before half time. Substitute Juan Bernat added the fourth two minute from the end. Without captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic for a second straight game, Sweden struggled to convert their chances but still beat Liechtenstein 2-0 in their Group G Euro 2016 qualifier at the Friends Arena on Sunday. Jimmy Durmaz pokes the ball past Lichtenstein goalkeeper Daniel Kaufmann to put Sweden 2-0 up. Slovenia's players celebrate after scoring; Lithuania,though, remain second in the group. Erkan Zengin broke the deadlock after 34 minutes with his second goal in three qualifying games, his thumping shot taking a deflection off a defender and looping over the goalkeeper into the net. Jimmy Durmaz doubled Sweden's advantage in the first minute of the second half, stabbing the ball home from close range after Bicer horribly sliced a left-footed clearance into his path. Slovakia followed up their impressive victory over Spain with a 3-1 win over Belarus. Napoli midfielder Marik Hamsik scored a brace for the visitors, while Stanislav Sestak added a third. Timofei Kalachev scored the hosts' only goal. Milivoje Novakovic scored the winning goal on Thursday for Slovenia, and the veteran forward continued his impressive form by grabbing a brace to help the visitors beat Lithuania 2-0. The win draws Slovenia level on points with Lithuania as they climb up to second in Group E. Napoli midfielder Marik Hamsik celebrates after scoring Slovakia's opening goal against Belarus. Highlights:","output":"- Wayne Rooney's 74th-minute free-kick led England to a 1-0 victory over Estonia, topping Group E in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. - Moldova managed a surprise 1-1 draw with Russia, thanks to Alexandru Epureanu's header.

Is the review positive or negative? A:","output":"The review provided appears to be primarily negative. The reviewer acknowledges a few positive aspects of Alicia Keys' work, such as her being pretty and having a pretty voice, as well as her talent in playing multiple instruments. However, the majority of the commentary highlights the shortcomings of the album. Firstly, the reviewer seems unimpressed by the label of \\"neo classic soul\\" and appears to find the songwriting lacking. The reviewer suggests that the album could have been improved with the input of more experienced songwriters and instrumentalists, implying that the current state of the music is subpar. Secondly, though the reviewer states not being a fan of \\"Falling,\\" they do mention enjoying \\"Butterflies.\\" However, this single positive note does not seem to outweigh the overall disappointment expressed in the other aspects of the review. Lastly, the reviewer criticizes the originality of the album, feeling that sampling a classical piece and adding beats does not make it original or creative. The comparison to India Irie or Jill Scott's little sister indicates that the reviewer sees Alicia Keys' work as an imitation or lesser version of other artists in the genre. In summary, the review leans more towards being negative due to the several criticisms about songwriting, originality, and the need for more experienced input. Although there are a few compliments mentioned, they are not strong enough to counterbalance the overall negativity of the review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Disturbed, Cassidy admits the trio's real reason for being in the school, which angers Pfeifer. As the group tries to look for a way out of the school, they find news coverage of Charlie's death that includes an interview with his girlfriend Alexis. They also discover that Charlie was not supposed to have performed that day, and was only on stage because he was the understudy for the main actor, Reese's father Rick. The group becomes separated when Reese runs off with the camera, with Ryan being left alone. As he searches for Reese, he sees various things, such as a half finished plate of food, a cup of coffee, a hidden room with a mattress and bed frame, and what looks like a body hanging from above. When the group is reunited, they hear footsteps above them that stop above Cassidy. She is then yanked into the air by seemingly nothing, leaving her with burns on her neck that look like rope burns. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person that finds a half-finished plate of food in the article is Ryan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Edward Nicholas Anderson (November 11, 1900 - April 24, 1974) was an American football player and coach of football and basketball. He served as the head football coach at Columbia College in Dubuque, Iowa, now known as Loras College (1922-1924), DePaul University (1925-1931), the College of the Holy Cross (1933-1938, 1950-1964), and the University of Iowa (1939-1942, 1946-1949), compiling a career college football record of 201-128-15. Anderson was also the head basketball coach at DePaul from 1925 to 1929, tallying a mark of 25-21. Anderson played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) for the Rochester Jeffersons in 1922 and the Chicago Cardinals from 1922 to 1925. Context: By the time Anderson had returned from the service, Iowa football was again in the cellar of the Big Ten. Before the 1946 season, Anderson was hospitalized for 19 days with a parasite infection. He returned to lead Iowa to four wins in their first five games, which was as many wins as Iowa had during his three-year absence. Still, Iowa slumped to a 5-4 final record, leading two former players to write a scathing editorial about Anderson. The editorial asked, \\"How long will Dr. Anderson ride on the laurels that Nile Kinnick won for him?\\"  In 1947, a 2-2-1 start was followed by three straight losses. One day before Iowa's final game at Minnesota, Anderson submitted his resignation at Iowa, citing \\"considerable loose talk\\" among Iowa fans as one reason. The Hawkeye football team responded with a powerful effort against Minnesota, defeating the Gophers, 13-7. Fans begged Anderson to reconsider, and the Iowa athletic board denied his resignation, promising him a larger coaching staff and other football improvement s. Anderson decided to stay, saying, \\"I'm glad we got things straightened out.\\" Anderson used his larger coaching staff to hire Leonard Raffensperger as the head of the freshman team.  After two more average seasons in 1948 and 1949, Anderson was approached again by Holy Cross, which now had a coaching vacancy. Ohio State made a rare concession and offered their football coach faculty tenure, so Anderson made the same request to Iowa athletic director Paul Brechler. Brechler could not promise Anderson anything, so Anderson resigned and took the head coaching position at Holy Cross. He had a 35-33-2 record in eight years at Iowa. Question: What team did he use it for? Answer:","output":"Edward Nicholas Anderson used his larger coaching staff for the Iowa football team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me share my dismay with the visit to (insert business name) so that you may find a better place to spend your hard-earned money and precious time. Let me start by addressing the ambiance or rather how it lacks anything remotely inviting. Upon entering, I was greeted by dull, lifeless walls, aged and unkempt furniture that produced an uneasy creak with every use, and glaring fluorescent lighting that only worsened the environment. The decor seemed to be competing in a battle of mediocrity, and this unsettling atmosphere did not change during my entire time there. As I held out hope that perhaps the service could compensate for the disappointing environment, I was met with unenthusiastic and unprofessional staff members who seemed not just uninterested but completely oblivious to customers' needs. I couldn't help but wonder if our invisible cloaks had somehow been activated as we were left unattended for an agonizingly long time in the waiting area. Once finally ushered to our table, hidden frustrations were beginning to mount – and yet, could it get worse? Regrettably. My friends and I placed our orders and thus began our seemingly endless wait for the food, our only solace being the sweet illusion that a delightful meal could somewhat save this disastrous experience. Our illusion was shattered by the mediocre cuisine that was presented almost an eternity later. Not only did the presentation resemble a battlefield of poorly assembled ingredients, but the taste also left a lot to be desired. The lack of freshness was evident, questioning the integrity of the kitchen. I have tasted bland dishes in my life, but their flavorless concoctions took the prize. Moreover, the inaccuracy in some of the orders added insult to injury, and even polite requests for corrections were met with more lackluster enthusiasm from the staff. No amount of optimism could salvage the experience after the culinary fiasco, and to add a cherry on top, the excessive and unjustifiable bill served as the ultimate gut-punch. There was barely an attempt to interact, address concerns, or even just smile from the staff throughout our ordeal.

One night in Portsmouth, England in 1787, a press gang breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service.  One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is HMS Bounty. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian, the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti, and his daughter, Tehani, and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti. Christian promises her he will be back someday.

Generally, you can use short journal articles or webpages for a shorter paper. For a longer paper, you'll likely need to look at books and longer scholarly articles. While the requirements differ based on your assignment and the topic you're researching, you may find these guidelines helpful:  1- to 2-page paper: 2 to 3 webpages or short journal articles 3- to 5-page paper: 4 to 8 journal or scholarly articles, webpages, or books 5- to 10-page paper: 6 to 15 journal or scholarly articles, webpages, or books 10- to 15-page paper: 12 to 20 journal or scholarly articles, webpages, or books The success of your research depends on searching the right keywords, especially in its initial stages.

Take advantage of academic databases available online through your school in addition to the internet. The letters stand for Currency, Reliability, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose/Point of view. This method provides you an easy way to quickly and uniformly evaluate the quality of potential sources you find by asking specific questions about the source:   Currency: How recent is the information? When was the source last updated?  Reliability: Are there references for facts and data? Is the content mostly opinion?  Authority: Who is the creator of the content? Who is the publisher? Are they biased in any way? Does the creator have academic credentials in the field?  Accuracy: Has the content been peer-reviewed or edited by a third party? Is information supported by evidence? Can you easily verify facts in another source?  Purpose/Point of view: Is the content intended to teach you something or to sell you something? Is the information presented biased? When you find a good source for your topic, chances are that source cites other valuable sources that you can look up. The biggest benefit of this is that you don't have to do as much work evaluating the quality of these sources – the author of the source that cited them has already done that for you.  If an author mentions a particular source more than once, you definitely want to read that material. The reference list typically contains enough information for you to find the source on your own. If you find that you can't access the source, for example, because it's behind a paywall, talk to your school or a public librarian about it. They may be able to get you access.

Cake (stylized CAKE) is an American alternative rock band from Sacramento, California, consisting of singer John McCrea, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Daniel McCallum and drummer Todd Roper. The band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and monotone vocals, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including country music, Mariachi, rock, funk, Iranian folk music and hip hop. Cake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown (guitar), Frank French (drums) and Shon Meckfessel (bass), who soon left and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's fifth album, Pressure Chief, was recorded in June 2004 in a converted house in Sacramento; the album was again released on Columbia Records. Before its official release date on October 5, the band played at the Austin City Limits Music Festival and KBCO's World Class Rockfest. The album was also preceded by its first single, \\"No Phone\\", which hit number 13 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart; the song covered the ubiquitous and privacy-invading use of cell phones, and was described by Jeremy Mahadevan of the New Straits Times as \\"a traditionally minimalist Cake anthem, with a killer melody and, unique to this album, fairly extensive use of synths\\". A second single, \\"Wheels\\", was also released but failed to chart. Pressure Chief itself hit number 17 on the Billboard top 200, spending 7 weeks in the charts, and received mixed reviews from critics. Although it was acknowledged as a continuation of their old work, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers, Sam Spies of the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that \\"the experiments in style that made Cake fun to listen to have all but disappeared from 'Pressure Chief' ... What's left is mostly uninspired, so-called alternative rock\\", and Graeme Hammond of the Sunday Herald Sun wrote that \\"the melodies are listless, the album bereft of anything with the verve of Short Skirt/Long Jacket or Comfort Eagle\\".  Other critics were more generous; Doug Elfman of the Las Vegas Review-Journal called it \\"another great and bizarre, twangy album of alternative-singer-songwriting stories about cars and horrible relationships\\", while a reviewer in the New Straits Times noted its \\"smart, subtly dissident, and always catchy pop\\". Following Pressure Chief's release, the band toured North America, playing in cities including Albany, New York, and Montreal. A second tour, in 2005, saw the band headline the 20-city Virgin College Mega Tour, playing alongside Gomez; while the Tour was in California, the band announced that it had been dropped from Columbia Records. This was followed by a tour of Europe, as well as concerts in Australia and Jakarta, along with a 2006 repeat of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, featuring Cake, Tegan and Sara and Gogol Bordello.  Cake later formed its own label, Upbeat Records, which allowed the band to release the compilation album B-Sides and Rarities on August 14, 2007. This was followed by a series of concerts, including at the IndigO2 in London, and a performance in Anchorage, Alaska. Reviews of B-Sides and Rarities were generally good; Devin Grant of The Post and Courier wrote that \\"For an album full of odds and ends, this Cake release is every bit as good, and every bit as fun, as the band's previous studio releases\\", while Catherine P. Lewis of The Washington Post noted that, although several live tracks reduced the album's strength, \\"there are still enough charming nuggets to make this album less disposable than the typical rarities compilation\\".

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the producer who provided the studio where the band that rehearsed in a deconsecrated church recorded their first single? from the following article ?  In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene.

While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima Blush giving a sadomasochistic beating to a patient in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Blush finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which scans his eye. Bond is seen by Blush and an attempt is subsequently made to kill him in the clinic gym, but Bond manages to defeat the assassin. Blush and her charge, a United States Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi, are operatives of SPECTRE, a criminal organisation run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the retinal pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent iris recognition security at an American military base in England. While doing so, he replaces the dummy warheads of two cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads; SPECTRE then steals the warheads, intending to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments. Blush murders Petachi to cover SPECTRE's tracks. Under orders from the Prime Minister, M reluctantly reactivates the double-0 section and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her wealthy lover, Maximillian Largo, a SPECTRE agent. Bond follows Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas, where he spars with Blush and Largo.

Let me first state that I enjoy watching \\"bad\\" movies. It's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones. This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. This vehicle for Sam Mraovich's delusional ego doesn't just border on talentless ineptitude, it has redefined the very meaning of the words. This should forever be the barometer for bad movies. Sort of the Mendoza line for film.

As a libertarian I believe gays should have a right to get married. Ben & Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes. The portrayal of all things Christian are so ugly and ham-fisted, trademark Mraovich, that you can't possibly take any of them seriously.

The judge in the murder trial of Etan Patz today refused to release the man accused of killing the six-year-old after the prosecution reminded him of the brutal crime he confessed to. Pedro Hernandez, from New Jersey, appeared in court today, where his lawyer asked that he be released from jail immediately due to the slow-moving case and lack of evidence against his client. But the prosecution asked that this request be denied, reminding the court: 'Let's remember he killed a six-year-old child.'

Washington (CNN) -- Human rights groups met a somewhat skeptical Supreme Court on Tuesday as they presented arguments on whether foreign victims of torture and other crimes against humanity can sue corporations and other organizations in U.S. federal courts. The cases argued could have enormous global impact from a moral, political, and financial perspective. At issue is the scope of two federal laws that are increasingly being used in an effort to hold businesses accountable for human rights atrocities committed overseas. Two separate civil cases before the high court involve Nigerian political activists claiming foreign oil companies were complicit in violent abuse at the hands of the country's military; and an American family alleging their father was tortured and killed while in the custody of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. \\"The principle that here would apply is Pirates Inc.

For cpr and first aid, place such documents into a freezer bag or waterproof container..","output":"First, let me outline the steps to dress a chest wound, and then I will discuss the available options you mentioned. 1. Assess the situation: Ensure your own safety and that of the patient. Make sure there are no hazards in the area that could cause further injury. 2. Call emergency services: As you mentioned, calling for professional help is crucial. If you can, provide them with details about the nature of the injury, the patient's condition, and your location. 3. Expose the wound: Remove any clothing around the chest wound to get a clear view of the injury. Be gentle as you do this and make sure not to cause any further damage. 4. Seal the wound: Use a sterile occlusive dressing or any available clean, non-porous material to cover the chest wound. This helps prevent air from entering the wound, which can worsen the injury. 5. Secure the dressing: Tape the dressing in place, leaving one corner slightly untaped to allow air to escape if necessary. This is known as a three-sided seal. 6. Monitor the patient: Keep the patient comfortable and still, if possible, elevate the head to ease breathing. Continuously check for any changes in the patient's condition, such as difficulty breathing or a weak, rapid pulse. 7. Provide additional care as needed: If the patient loses consciousness or stops breathing, begin CPR. Now, let's discuss the options you provided: a) Providing antibiotics and fluids can be helpful, but these are treatments that should be administered by medical professionals once they arrive on the scene. Your priority is to control immediate bleeding and dress the wound. b) Calling emergency services is indeed a crucial step. The sooner you do this, the better the chances of survival for the patient. c) Once again, calling 911 and getting professional help as quickly as possible is essential. Keeping the patient still, sealing, and stopping the bleeding are top priorities. d) While it's important to have relevant documents available for emergency personnel, your priority should be addressing the chest wound. Be prepared to provide any pertinent medical information when asked, but make sure you're attending to the wound first. Remember that dressing a chest wound is a first-aid measure that buys time until medical help arrives.

The store's expansive product line and higher volume of transactions, along with its more complex supply chain and extensive inventory, meant that the accounting and tracking of different tax liabilities became a more intricate and time-consuming process.  On the other hand, the diner, being a smaller business, operated with a lesser number of taxable transactions, making the task of calculating taxes for the diner relatively more manageable. As a food establishment, the diner's tax-related concerns primarily revolved around sales tax and payroll taxes for employees.  Moreover, the complexity of tax calculation for the store was compounded by the fact that it dealt with various types of goods. Each of these items may have been subjected to different tax rates and requirements depending on the specific nature of the product and the jurisdiction they fell under. This encompassed keeping track of tax-exempt items, handling rebates, and managing tax credit on certain purchases. In comparison, the diner's scope of taxable items was narrower and simple, generally limited to food and beverages served to customers. Though the diner would still need to account for different tax rates on items such as alcohol or other specific products, the overall process was less cumbersome when compared to the store's diverse inventory. Furthermore, the store's extensive supply chain and robust relationship with vendors presented additional layers of tax complexity. The store needed to correctly calculate tax implications during various stages of the supply chain: from purchase orders to warehouse storage, transportation, and finally, sales. Issues such as tax adjustments for damaged or returned goods would be more commonplace occurrences in such a setting, further complicating the tax calculation. In contrast, the diner predominantly worked with a smaller number of suppliers that provided ingredients and food-related supplies for the establishment. It had a limited number of direct tax liabilities related to its inventory and faced less complex challenges regarding tax adjustments or refunds on returned supplies, providing a more straightforward tax calculation process. In conclusion, it was easier to calculate taxes for the diner than for the store because the latter was a bigger business with a more complex operational structure and a wider scope of taxable goods. In a nutshell, the store had to navigate a more intricate tax landscape filled with unique challenges, requiring additional time and effort to ensure compliance and accuracy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Voting is underway in the southern U.S. state of Alabama in a tightly contested Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore, a campaign roiled by charges from women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct four decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Tuesday's special election was being watched nationally, both as an indicator of how midterm congressional elections might play out next November and also as a barometer of President Donald Trump's political clout. Trump endorsed Moore, who has denied the women's allegations, and called for the defeat of Jones, whom he said would be a political \\"puppet\\" of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington. The election winner will serve the last three years of the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions when he joined Trump's Cabinet as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement position. If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda. Pre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones. No Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \\"a distinguished Republican\\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14. Moore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.

Q: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words. You should create more such trigger words and use them in your twin sentences. | Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword |  | age | old | new |  | altitude | low | high | | area | small | vast |  | brightness | dark | light |  | clarity | obscure | clear |  | cleanness | dirty | clean |  | complexity | simple | complex |  | cost | cheap | expensive | | density | sparse | dense | | depth | shallow | deep | | distance | near | far |   | electric conductivity | low | high | | flexibility | rigid | flexible | | granularity | fine | coarse |  | hardness | soft | hard |  | length | short | long |  | magnitude | small | large |  | mass | small | large |  | odor | weak | strong |  | pressure | low | high |  | resistance | low | high |  | shape | round | sharp | | shape | flat | spiky | | size | small | large |  | sound | quiet | loud |  | sound pitch | low | high |  | speed | slow | fast |  | stability | unstable | stable |  | strength | weak | strong |  | temperature | low | high |  | texture | smooth | rough |  | thermal conductivity | low | high | | thickness | thin | thick |  | volume | small | large | | weight | light | heavy |  | width | narrow | wide |  | location | in | out | | location | up | down | | location | above | below | | location | on | off | | location | to | from | Context Word: Manx. A:","output":"Part #1: Create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_). Usage: \\"I filled my ________ with coffee.\\" and \\"I filled my ________ with water.\\" The first part requires the generation of two sentences, each containing a blank space. This is met as two sentences are created, each having a blank space for a word to complete it. Part #2: The sentence pair should look similar. Usage: \\"He put the hat on his head because it was sunny.\\" and \\"He put the scarf around his neck because it was chilly.\\" The sentences have a similar structure and phrasing, meeting the requirement of looking similar. Part #3: Sentences should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Usage: \\"The _________ in the museum was ancient.\\" and \\"The ________ in the airport was brand new.\\" These sentences are about two related objects (potentially artifacts or items), but the objects themselves (a museum artifact and an airport item) are different. Part #4: Contrast in sentences using trigger words. Usage: \\"The ________ in the room was very bright.\\" and \\"The _________ in the alley was really dark.\\" In these sentences, 'bright' and 'dark' act as contrasting trigger words, adding a contrasting element. Part #5: Answers should depend on the context present in twin sentences and not be associated with the trigger words. Usage: Based on context, the answer for \\"John put his pasta in the _______\\" could be 'bowl', and for \\"Joan put her keys in her _______\\" could be 'purse'. The context of the sentences, not the trigger words, indicate that the answers should be 'bowl' and 'purse', respectively. Part #6: Twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Usage: \\"Despite being quite weighty, the ________ was remarkably compact.\\" (9 words) \\"Although it was light, the ________ was disproportionately large.\\" (9 words) Both sentences have fewer than 30 but more than 15 words, so this criteria is met. Part #7: Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. Usage: \\"She took her ________ out from the drawer\\" and \\"He took his ________ out from the bag.\\" The sentences share much of the same phrasing and structure, overlapping in more than 70% of their words. Part #8: ObjectX and Y should have the same number.  Usage: \\"The _______ in the box was fragile\\" and \\"The _______ on the shelf was sturdy\\" The objects referred to in both sentences are singular, complying with the rule. Part #9: The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Usage: \\"The ________ in the cupboard was dusty.\\" and \\"The ________ under the table was clean.\\" Both sentences use their respective objects only once, following this requirement. Part #10: You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Usage: Assuming the context word is \\"soda\\", \\"She poured the __________ into the glass.\\" and \\"He poured the _________ into the cup.\\" In both sentences, the context word 'soda' can be inserted into the blanks, making correct and contextually appropriate sentences. This meets the criteria of using the context word in the twin sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  Now, I have a new situation: Marion county used coal and oil to produce electricity, while James county used nuclear energy for its electricity production. Both counties had a flourishing economy.  Answer this question please: Which county used more nuclear fission to produce energy? Answer:","output":"James county used more nuclear fission to produce energy. Step 1: Review both counties' energy production methods. The question tells us that Marion county used coal and oil for its energy production, while James county used nuclear energy.  Step 2: Determine the method of energy production used in each county. Here we can see that Marion County produced its energy by burning coal and oil, both of which are fossil fuels, not radioactive elements needed for nuclear fission. On the other hand, James County produced energy using nuclear power, which does involve nuclear fission. Step 3: Determine which county used more nuclear fission. Given that nuclear fission is required for nuclear energy production, and given that only James County used nuclear energy, it stands to reason that James County used more nuclear fission in their energy production than Marion County. Therefore, James county used more nuclear fission to produce energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Next question: where do you find neurons in the brain?","output":"To find neurons in the brain, we should understand what neurons are and in which regions of the brain they are located. We can follow these steps to achieve this: Step 1: Understand neurons Neurons, also known as nerve cells, are the fundamental units of the nervous system. They are specialized cells responsible for transmitting information through electrical and chemical signals. Step 2: Identify the major regions of the brain The brain consists of several major regions, including: - Cerebrum - Cerebellum - Brainstem Step 3: Examine the cerebrum The cerebrum constitutes the largest part of the brain. It has left and right hemispheres, and it is further divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. Each of these regions contains billions of neurons that are responsible for different functions such as sensory perception, motor functions, and cognitive tasks. Step 4: Investigate the cerebellum The cerebellum is situated below the cerebrum and is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements, maintaining posture, and balance. It also contains millions of neurons that are organized into distinct layers. Step 5: Explore the brainstem The brainstem is the lower part of the brain that connects to the spinal cord. It controls essential functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. It also houses numerous neurons, especially in the reticular formation, which is involved in arousal, attention, and sleep. By understanding these regions and the functions they perform in the brain, we can conclude that neurons are found throughout the brain. They exist in the cerebrum, cerebell-display:inline;um, and brainstem, and are responsible for various functions like sensory perception, motor control, and essential life functions."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who is attacked by angry landowners?

ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.

Last week, the Uber investors Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein wrote in an open letter to the company that they were frustrated with how Uber had handled its culture issues and that they had “hit a dead end in trying to influence the company quietly from the inside.”      The issue involving Mr. Singhal dates to 2015, when he was still at Google. The search giant deemed an employee’s claim of sexual harassment against Mr. Singhal “credible” in an internal investigation, according to two people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because they were not allowed to speak on the matter.

At the time, Mr. Singhal said he wanted to devote time to philanthropy; he joined Uber less than a year later.      “Harassment is unacceptable in any setting,” Mr. Singhal said in a statement Monday. “I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior. In my 20-year career, I’ve never been accused of anything like this before, and the decision to leave Google was my own.”      Uber and Google declined to comment on Mr. Singhal.      Mr. Singhal was hired to oversee Uber’s mapping division as well as a unit that runs the dispatching, marketing and pricing of Uber cars. He reported directly to Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, and advised Anthony Levandowski, who runs the company’s self-driving automobile efforts.      Mr. Singhal’s dismissal is another example of both the talent pipeline and the competition between Google and Uber. Last week, Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, filed a lawsuit against Uber accusing it of colluding with Mr. Levandowski, a former Google employee, to steal its autonomous vehicle technology. Uber called the suit “baseless.”      Uber, now privately valued at nearly 70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. In August, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive who was instrumental in GV’s 250 million investment in Uber in 2013, stepped down from Uber’s board of directors as it became increasingly clear the two companies were on a collision course.      Mr. Singhal, hired by Google in 2000, was that company’s 176th employee, and he rewrote many of the original search algorithms created by the company’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Singhal is credited as one of the engineers who built the smarter and faster search engine that gave Google what has proved to be an insurmountable advantage in web search.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Upon joining Uber, Mr. Singhal wrote on his blog that he felt like Uber was a “geek’s candy store” because it was trying to solve “one of the most challenging computer science problems I’ve encountered in my thirty-year career.” ||||| Amit Singhal has left his job at Uber as its SVP of engineering because he did not disclose to the car-hailing company that he left Google a year earlier after top executives there informed him of an allegation of sexual harassment from an employee that an internal investigation had found “credible.�?      Singhal was asked to resign by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick this morning.      Uber execs found out about the situation after Recode informed them of the chain of events between Singhal and the search giant this week.      Sources at Uber said that the company did extensive background checks of Singhal and that it did not uncover any hint of the circumstances of his departure from Google. Singhal disputed the allegation to Google execs at the time.      In a statement to me, Singhal denied the allegation again, although he did acknowledge the dispute with Google.      “Harassment is unacceptable in any setting. I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior,�? he wrote to me in an email. “In my 20-year career, I’ve never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own.�?      This revelation comes at a dicey time for Uber, as it has been under scrutiny of late, due to an explosive blog post by a former female engineer who alleged numerous incidents of sexism, sexual harassment and also painted a picture of a very dysfunctional HR department and management structure.      To be clear, Singhal’s dispute with Google has nothing to do with that situation or the recent lawsuit that Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has waged against Uber’s Otto division.      But having Singhal at the head of an organization under siege over sexual harassment issues when he was not candid with Uber over his departure from Google was considered untenable.      Indeed. According to multiple sources and internal notes read to me, after discussing the claims of an alleged encounter between Singhal and a female employee first with former Google HR head Laszlo Bock and also Google CEO Sundar Pichai in late 2015, he denied those claims at the time. He also apparently stated a number of times that there were two sides to every story.      But, after the Christmas holidays, he then decided to resign himself after a 15-year career there.      Sources said that Google was prepared to fire Singhal over the allegations after looking into the incident, but that it did not have to do so after he resigned.      Sources said the female employee who filed the formal complaint against Singhal did not work for him directly, but worked closely with the search team. She also did not want to go public with the charges, which is apparently why Google decided to allow Singhal to leave quietly.      He was also a well-regarded executive there, who was well liked by many I have spoken to at Google. He rose to a top job as SVP of search and has had a distinguished career as a technologist in Silicon Valley. (You can hear an interview I did with him onstage at the Code Mobile conference in late 2015 here.)      But his sudden departure from Google in early 2016 came soon after he had reorganized his huge and critical division, a move that definitely set off alarm bells with me and many others both inside and outside of Google.      You could not tell that there were any problems, though, from the outward behavior of both sides. When Singhal left, said sources, Google settled major outstanding grants he had, and his own goodbye letter read more like a retirement missive. More to the point, it gave no hint of acrimony between himself and his longtime employer.      “As I entered the fifteenth year of working at Google, I've been asking myself the question, ‘What would you want to do for the next fifteen?’ The answer has overwhelmingly been: Give back to others. It has always been a priority for me to give back to people who are less fortunate, and make time for my family amidst competing work constraints — but on both fronts, I simply want to give and do more,�? he wrote. “Now is a good time to make this important life change.�?      But within a year, rather than do good, Singhal had gotten a top job at Uber.      Google declined to comment on the circumstances of Singhal’s departure. Uber also declined to comment beyond its confirmation of Singhal’s departure and about the details of his hiring. ||||| FILE- In this May 15, 2013, file photo, Amit Singhal, senior vice president and software engineer at Google Inc., speaks at Google I/O 2013 in San Francisco.

Singhal, a top engineering executive at Uber,... (Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — A top engineering executive at Uber, Amit Singhal, is out five weeks after his hire was announced. According to a report in the tech blog Recode, Singhal failed to disclose that he'd left his previous job at Google because of a sexual harassment allegation.      Singhal denied the allegation and said he left Google a year ago for his own reasons.      The dustup is just the latest sign of turmoil at Uber, which last week found itself in an unrelated sexual harassment firestorm . That stemmed from a detailed essay published by a former female Uber engineer, who charged that her prospects at the company evaporated after she complained about sexual advances from her boss. In the post about her year at Uber , Susan Fowler said the company's human resources department ignored her complaints because her boss was a high performer.      Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has called for an independent investigation of those issues, and the company has hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to help.      In a statement emailed to The Associated Press, Singhal said: \\"Harassment is unacceptable in any setting. I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior. In my 20-year career, I've never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own.\\"      According to Recode, Singhal left Google after executives there informed him of a harassment allegation lodged by an employee, one an internal investigation had found \\"credible.\\" Citing unnamed sources at Uber, Recode said the company did \\"extensive background checks of Singhal\\" but did not uncover \\"any hint of the circumstances of his departure from Google.\\"      Representatives for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Uber declined to comment beyond confirming that Singhal is no longer with the company. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Uber's SVP of engineering, Amit Singhal, has resigned after failing to disclose to the company that he left Google a year ago in the wake of a \\"credible\\" sexual harassment allegation lodged against him.

If It is expected that one SCR system requires about 21 months of total effort for planning, engineering, installation, and startup., can we conclude that \\"It takes about 21 months of total effort for one SCR system.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the given information, we can conclude that \\"It takes about 21 months of total effort for one SCR system.\\" This statement concisely summarizes the expectation that the planning, engineering, installation, and startup of a single SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system requires a collective effort of approximately 21 months. However, it is important to note that this time estimate may vary depending on various factors that can influence the duration of each stage of the process. Some of these factors include: 1. Planning: The planning stage involves determining project requirements, goals, and objectives, as well as conducting site assessments, cost analyses, resource allocations, and feasibility studies. The time taken for this stage depends on the complexity of the SCR system being installed, the availability of accurate data, and the efficiency of communication among stakeholders. 2. Engineering: Engineering involves the design and development of the SCR system. This stage requires a thorough understanding of the technical requirements, equipment specifications, and operating conditions. Expertise in the specific technology, as well as the availability of skilled engineers, may significantly impact the duration of this stage. 3. Procurement and fabrication: After finalizing the design, the required equipment and components must be procured, and custom components may need fabrication. The procurement and fabrication timelines may depend on the availability of materials, the complexity of the components, and the efficiency of the supply chain. 4. Installation: The installation stage involves integrating the SCR system into the existing infrastructure. This may require deconstruction and modifications of existing infrastructure, transport and placement of the equipment, and appropriate wiring, piping, and ductwork. The time taken for the installation stage depends on factors such as site accessibility, equipment size, and the level of coordination between various teams working on the project. 5. Startup and commissioning: During this stage, the SCR system is tested and started up for the first time. This may involve calibrating equipment, conducting performance tests, training personnel, and fine-tuning the processes. The time required for startup and commissioning may vary based on the readiness of the infrastructure, the skill level of the operating staff, and the complexity of the SCR system. 6. External factors: Regulatory compliance, permitting, approval processes, and weather conditions can also impact the overall timeframe of the project. Considering all these factors, it is essential to recognize that the estimate of 21 months of total effort for one SCR system may not always remain constant and could vary based on specific circumstances for each project. However, the given statement does provide a general understanding of the time required to successfully plan, engineer, install, and start up an SCR system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The sun is shining brightly overhead, and the soft hum of insects fills the air. It is a warm day, and the men are starting to feel the effects of the heat. Around mid-morning, they decide to take a break and rest for a moment under the shade of a large apple tree. As they sit down, the most logical next event would be for the two men to start a conversation with each other. They might discuss the progress they have made so far in the orchard, commenting on the quality and quantity of the fruits they have picked. They might also discuss any challenges they've faced during the job, such as reaching for fruits high up in the trees or navigating through the rows of trees without getting stuck. After discussing work-related topics, the conversation could shift to more personal matters. They might share stories about their lives, families, and experiences that have shaped them into the people they are today. They would talk about their hopes, fears, and dreams for the future. They would also share their interests and hobbies outside of work, such as sports, movies, or music they enjoy listening to. As the break continues, the men might also decide to take out their packed lunches to eat while they rest. They would share with each other the various food items they brought with them, perhaps even discovering common likes and dislikes. They might be surprised to find out that they both enjoy the same type of sandwich or chips. As they eat, they might also discuss recipes for their favorite dishes and exchange cooking tips or secrets. At some point during their break, the weather might take a sudden turn, and a gentle breeze could pick up, providing some much-needed relief from the sweltering heat. The men would delight in the refreshing coolness as they continue to chat and laugh, deepening their bond as co-workers and friends. As their break comes to an end, the two men would decide to get back to work, motivated and energized by their shared conversation and the knowledge that they now have a better understanding of each other. With renewed spirits, they would tackle the remaining tasks in the orchard with enthusiasm and efficiency, working together in harmony and camaraderie. In conclusion, the most logical next event for these two men working together in an orchard would be a well-deserved break, during which they would have the opportunity to engage in conversation about their work and personal lives. This break would not only allow the men to rest and recharge physically but also help strengthen their relationship as colleagues and friends by allowing them to get to know one another on a more intimate level.

In order to do this, the detective must conduct a thorough investigation, during which they will search for and analyze relevant information in order to uncover the facts that will construct the bigger picture. Throughout the investigation, the detective will most likely come across a myriad of lies and half-truths, which are deliberately or unintentionally intended to mislead them in their pursuit of the truth.

Please answer the following question: -  Owls hunt around their hunting territory away from where they roost during the day - They sit still on a perch, like a stump of branch, and wait for prey - They use their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen - They use their very keen vision to see prey in the dark - They fly silently, without flapping their wings, in order to surprise the prey - The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process for an owl after successfully hunting and capturing its prey involves consuming and digesting the meal. This is a vital aspect of the owl's predatory behavior as it ensures the owl obtains the necessary nutrients and energy required for survival and maintaining daily activities. Once an owl has captured its prey in its sharp, powerful talons and secured it with its strong beak, it will usually return to a safe and secure location, such as a perch or its nest, to consume the meal. In some instances, especially when dealing with smaller prey, the owl will swallow the prey whole, headfirst. This method allows for easier passage through the owl's digestive system and prevents any limbs or appendages from getting caught while swallowing. As owls lack teeth, they rely on their specialized digestive system to break down their food. After swallowing the prey whole, it enters the owl's stomach, which is divided into two chambers: the proventriculus and the gizzard. The proventriculus secretes enzymes to break down the softer parts of the prey, including its organs, muscles, and other soft tissues. The gizzard, which contains small pieces of grit and stones, grinds up the harder parts of the prey, such as bones, feathers, and fur. These hard, indigestible parts are then compressed into a pellet within the gizzard. Once the digestion process is complete and the nutrients have been absorbed, the owl will regurgitate the pellet containing the indigestible remains of its meal. This process generally occurs several hours after consuming the prey, and the regurgitated pellet provides a clear indication of the owl's diet as well as the overall health of the species in its ecosystem. In summary, the last step of the process for an owl after hunting and capturing its prey is to consume and digest the meal in order to extract essential nutrients for energy and survival. This is achieved through the owl's specialized digestive system, which enables it to break down various types of prey even without the presence of teeth. The process is completed by the regurgitation of indigestible remains in the form of a pellet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Barack Hussein Obama II ( ( listen); born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. The first African American to assume the presidency, he was previously the junior United States Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. Before that, he served in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 until 2004. Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. Context: From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \\"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\\".  In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School-- a private college preparatory school-- with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \\"Barry\\". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.  Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \\"The opportunity that Hawaii offered - to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect - became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\\" Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \\"push questions of who I was out of my mind\\". Obama was also a member of the \\"choom gang\\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985. Question: Did he do anything political while in school? Answer:","output":"Yes, when Barack Obama was in school, he did some political things. When he was at Occidental College in Los Angeles, he made a speech in 1981 asking the college to not support South Africa because of their unfair treatment of black people, called apartheid. This was his first public speech and showed his interest in politics and helping people. Later, he studied political science at Columbia University in New York City, which helped him learn more about politics and how to make a difference in the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stan and Ollie are shown to a bedroom to sleep overnight, which is the room in which Ebeneezer was murdered. They hear a strange noise and in the darkness see a pair of eyes which turns out to be a cat. They then hear a scream and decide to investigate. Meanwhile, the butler is calling all of the relatives to a study telling them they have a phone call. After sitting in a chair and lifting the handset of the phone, the lights go out, there is a scream and a sound like a door slamming, and the relative is never seen again. Stan and Ollie return to their bedroom and get into the bed but a bat has flown into their room and is under their covers, which causes them to panic and run downstairs. All of the other relatives have now disappeared and the butler calls Stan and Ollie to take a telephone call in the study. Ollie sits in the chair to take the call. This time, however, the lights stay on and it is revealed that the chair is affixed to a trapdoor into which each of the other relatives vanished. Ollie falls through the trapdoor, but is saved due to his having become wedged in the chair. The murderer (a man dressed in drag) appears through a secret door with a knife. A fight ensues, but then Stan and Ollie both wake up from a dream, fighting over Stan's fishing line at the dockside and then falling into the water., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"Stan Laurel shares a room with the man who is saved by getting stuck in a chair.  In the provided article, Stan and Ollie, the main characters from the comedic duo Laurel and Hardy, decide to investigate a large estate left by the recently deceased Ebeneezer Laurel. Upon reaching the mansion, they are informed about Ebeneezer's murder and the subsequent police investigation. The complex devised a plan by placing an advertisement in the newspaper to gather all potential heirs in the mansion. Stan and Ollie, as potential heirs, are shown to a bedroom to spend the night - the very room in which Ebeneezer was murdered. The article continues to describe their frightful experiences throughout the night, which include encountering a cat and a bat in the dark, and investigating ominous sounds and screams. The butler of the mansion leads other relatives to take phone calls in a study room. These relatives mysteriously disappear once the lights go out after they sit in a particular chair to lift the telephone handset. Indicatively, they vanish through a trapdoor that opens upon sitting in that chair.  When it was their turn to receive the call, Ollie sits in the chair. However, unlike the other relatives, the lights stay on, and Ollie falls through the trapdoor. Ollie's luck changes when he becomes wedged in the chair, instead of disappearing like the other relatives.  Now, coming back to your question, since it's mentioned in the article that Stan and Ollie are shown to a bedroom where they spend the night (the room where Ebeneezer was murdered), it can be inferred that Stan Laurel shares a room with Ollie, the man who is saved by getting stuck in the chair. Therefore, Stan Laurel is the answer to your question.  However, it's important to remember that the adventures at the Laurel mansion are revealed to be part of a dream as Stan and Ollie wake up at the dockside, where the story had initially begun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When he keels over from a heart attack, now itâs up to a grad student, Allison (Kari WÃ¼hrer, reprising her role), to keep it from the forces of darkness. Cut to the streets of Bucharest. A young girl named Maria loses her ball into the busy street. Suddenly, Lucifer (reprised by John Light) appears to her and tells her she should go get it.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: School can be a place where meanness and hostility grow, and many students forget the rules of treating each other well. Make a specific effort to be someone who counteracts this. Always speak kindly to people in the class by not criticizing their wrong answers or making fun when they struggle. The person you want to impress will take notice that you are someone who everyone sees as kind and good to be around. There are lots of ways to be more friendly. Go out of your way to be nice to students that usually are overlooked or bullied. Ask people how they are doing and really mean it and listen to their answers. Show an interest in your classmates’ lives outside of school. Your classmates will take notice if you are really great at something. Within the limits of school, you have the basic options of academic success, sports, and the arts, but don’t be afraid to find something outside of school to excel at. You shouldn’t get good at something for the sole purpose of impressing people, but it can be a good addition to making you well-rounded as a person.  You may not have a lot of opportunities to show the talent you have, but if something like a talent show does come up, have the confidence to go for it. It’s also a good option to invite the classmate to participate in the activity with you so you can show them the skills you have. If you want to be noticed, go out of your way to try things that everyone else seems to be afraid of doing. A great way to do this is to volunteer in class when the other students are sitting back not wanting to be picked. Your classmate will see that you are confident and will be impressed by your initiative. School can often be a time of stress, tension, and drama in aspects of school work, fighting among students, and times of performance like giving a speech. When the others around you are giving in to all the pressure, you can maintain a balanced composure and stay cool. Be someone who can handle whatever situations come your way. Your classmate will be impressed and will look to you as someone to rely on when things get rough.  A great way to stay composed in any situation is to take deep breaths and focus your attention on your breathing. When you start to feel stressed, your body's natural response is to speed up your breathing, but this often makes it harder to stay calm. Take breaths more slowly than you normally would. It can also help you stay calm to pause for 5-10 seconds before responding or reacting. Losing your cool tends to happen in an instant, but if you practice waiting for a little while before doing anything, you will have time to think first. It’s fairly common among students, and even adults, to want to talk a lot about themselves and tell all about their lives. You can make an impression on someone by showing true interest in what they like and think about. Go out of your way to notice some of their interests and then learn about those for yourself. Your classmate will be impressed that you cared to let them share with you and that you took an interest in them.  If you take the time to get into the interest they told you about, you can go back to the person and tell them about your experience. If they mention a band, go listen to their albums and tell them what you liked about it. Or watch the person’s favorite movie and go repeat a line from it to him or her. With so many people bragging about themselves and wanting everyone to notice them, you can stand out by giving a compliment. If your classmate wears an outfit you like, tell them how great they look. If they do well on a project or big assignment, congratulate them. If you know they played well in a sport over the weekend, tell them nice job. You can do this consistently over time, but not so often that it becomes obvious you are doing it.

The president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, took a trip to Korea on November 29, 1952, in order to learn how the Korean War might be brought to an end. This visit was a significant event that aided in the understanding of the situation in Korea and explored ways to potentially end the ongoing conflict.  During this time, the United Nations accepted India's proposed armistice for the Korean War, which led to the cessation of hostilities between the warring parties, including the KPA (Korean People's Army), the PVA (People's Volunteer Army), and the UN Command. The battle line at the time of the ceasefire was roughly along the 38th parallel, a latitudinal circle that served as a dividing line between North and South Korea. In the aftermath of the ceasefire agreement, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a designated buffer zone between North and South Korea intended to prevent further military confrontations. The DMZ, which has been in place since 1953, has been patrolled by representatives from the KPA, ROKA (Republic of Korea Army), United States, and Joint UN Command to maintain peace and security in the region. In summary, the key event that first occurred in the article during the 52nd year of the 20th century was the election of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the United States.

Context: Nutritionism is the view that excessive reliance on food science and the study of nutrition can lead to poor nutrition and to ill health. It was originally credited to Gyorgy Scrinis, and was popularized by Michael Pollan. Since nutrients are invisible, policy makers rely on nutrition experts to advise on food choices. Because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body, Pollan argues, nutritionism can be blamed for many of the health problems relating to diet in the Western World today.","output":"To study nutritionism, one would need to research and analyze the concept as provided in the context. This would involve examining the works of Gyorgy Scrinis, who originally credited the term, as well as studying the writings of Michael Pollan, who popularized it. Additionally, one should investigate the relationship between food science, nutrition, and health, as well as consider how policy makers utilize the advice of nutrition experts to shape food choices.

It is a beautiful place that I would highly recommend. I told my family that I was going to go find a port-a-pot. So I head off by myself. I’m in the port-a-pot, i’m in there for roughly 10 minutes. (you can assume what I was doing) I wash my hands and get ready to leave the port-a-pot, and I tried to open the door and it was locked. I’m claustrophobic, so I start to FREAK OUT. I started banging on the door, running into the door with all of my weight. Nothing was helping. I then start crying, I thought for sure that I was going to die. I knew it was the end, at the age of 14, locked in a port-a-pot, in 95 degree weather in the middle of a beach in Georgia. Looking back, i’m curious as to why my family never came to look for me, I was gone for like 30 minutes. So I’m banging on the door continuously, bawling my eyes out. Then a man opened the door for me, from the outside. He was about 6’3 with dreads about 12 inches long and weighed about 280 pounds. I ran out of the port-a-pot and jumped on the guy and gave him a hug and told him that I loved him and that he saved my life. I don’t know how he managed to open the door for me, but I definitely know that my 14 year old self owes that man my life. I’m not sure where he is in life, or what he’s doing, but I hope God is blessing him abundantly. It is definitely a funny story to tell my friends.

When she finally found them, their foremost emotion would likely be relief and happiness to see their child safe and sound. It is worth mentioning that while other options, such as being angry or confused, might have been possible emotions experienced by the parents, the most likely response would be happiness, as their primary concern would be for their child's well-being.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Context: Hoping to avoid their first three-game losing streak since 2011, the Broncos played host to the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday Night Football. The Bengals dominated the first half time of possession by more than a 2-1 margin. The Bengals took the opening possession of the game and marched down the field, with quarterback AJ McCarron, playing in place of the injured Andy Dalton, throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver A. J. Green in the corner of the end zone. The Bengals later added to their lead in the second quarter, with wide receiver Mohamed Sanu rushing for a 6-yard touchdown, in a \\"wildcat\\" formation. The Bengals were threatening to add to their lead just before the two-minute warning, but placekicker Mike Nugent missed wide right on a 45-yard field goal attempt. The Broncos then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus just before halftime. The Broncos took the initial possession of the second half, and pulled to within 14-10, with quarterback Brock Osweiler connecting with wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders on an 8-yard touchdown pass, which was the only scoring play of the third quarter. After having trouble stopping the Bengals' offense in the first half, the Broncos' defense forced the Bengals to punt on their first four possessions of the second half. The Broncos grabbed a 17-14 lead early in the fourth quarter, with running back C. J. Anderson scampering down the sideline for a 39-yard touchdown. A 52-yard field goal by Nugent helped the Bengals tie the game at 17-17 with 6:51 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Broncos had reached the Bengals' 27-yard line on the next possession, and were attempting a game-winning drive, but Bengals' defensive end Michael Johnson forced a fumble off Anderson, which was recovered by safety Reggie Nelson. However, the Broncos' defense forced a Bengals' punt, and the Broncos' offense began their next drive at their own 20-yard line with 1:40 remaining. However, McManus badly missed wide left on a potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt as time expired, sending the game to overtime. The Broncos won the overtime coin toss, and took a 20-17 lead on their initial possession, with a 37-yard field goal by McManus. The drive was aided by a 15-yard personal foul penalty on Bengals' linebacker Vontaze Burfict for a late hit out-of-bounds. The Bengals started their first offensive possession of overtime at their own 33-yard line, and on their first play, McCarron attempted a pass that was incomplete, as his arm was hit by Broncos' linebacker Von Miller. Broncos' head coach Gary Kubiak called a timeout, thinking the play should have been ruled as a game-ending fumble, however, the initial ruling was upheld by instant replay. On the very next play, McCarron fumbled the snap, which was recovered by Broncos' linebacker DeMarcus Ware to end the game and send the Broncos to the postseason for the fifth consecutive season. This was the third game of the season that the Broncos won after trailing 14-0 &#8212; the other two were Week 2 at the Kansas City Chiefs and Week 12 vs. the New England Patriots.

Next question: in what case did the us supreme court hand down its first opinion on august the 3rd 1791?","output":"The case you are referring to is West v. Barnes, 2 U.S. 401 (1791). This was the first case in which the U.S. Supreme Court handed down an opinion, and it was indeed on August 3, 1791. West v. Barnes is a relatively minor case in the grand scheme of American constitutional law, but its significance lies in its status as the first Supreme Court decision. The case itself dealt with a relatively mundane issue in procedure, specifically concerning the method of issuing a writ of error, a legal device which allows a higher court to review the decision of a lower court.  The dispute initiated when West, a Rhode Island citizen, filed a lawsuit against Barnes and another defendant (also from Rhode Island) in a circuit court. The suit was about a financial dispute over a series of promissory notes. The circuit court ruled in favor of Barnes, and West sought to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, aiming to secure a reversal. However, West had obtained a writ of error from a clerk in Rhode Island, rather than from a clerk of the Supreme Court located in the nation’s then-capital, Philadelphia. Herein lies the crux of the issue that made it to the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Act of 1789, a landmark law which set up the Federal court system, specified that the writs of error had to \\"be made returnable to the Supreme Court at the seat of government,\\" i.e., in Philadelphia. Barnes's lawyers argued that by the Judiciary Act's terms, the writ of error was invalid because it had been issued in Rhode Island, not in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court agreed with Barnes and affirmed the circuit court decision in favor of Barnes. The court held that the legal error in the proceedings was fatal to West's attempt to have the Supreme Court review the circuit court's decisions. The court argued that the rules were the rules, and they should be strictly adhered to, no matter how minor they might seem.  Apart from confirming the procedural rule, the case also demonstrated the court's early insistence on adhering to the precise language of the statutes, a concept known as legal formalism, and its reluctance to bend the rules \\"in the interests of justice,\\" a concept known as legal realism.  West v. Barnes may not be a well-known Supreme Court case, but as the first case to be decided by the Supreme Court, it laid the groundwork for the thousands of opinions that would follow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: English is the native or official language of one-fifth of the land area of the world. It is spoken in North America, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. In South Africa and India it is one of the official languages. More people study English than any other language. In many countries, the textbooks in universities are in English. Many university classes are taught in English even though the native language is not English. English is the language of international communication. It is the language of international business, research, and science. More than three-fourths of the world's mail is written in English. More than half of the scientific research journals are in English. Most other languages have borrowed many English words. Why did English become the international language? In the middle of the nineteenth century, French was the international language. The Britain became very powerful in the world. England started colonies in North America and India in the seventeenth century. By 1900 England also had colonies in other parts of Asia, Africa and the South Pacific. The people in the colonies had to use English. Slowly it became more important than French internationally. After the Second World War, the United States became very powerful, and even more people began to learn English. Is English a good international language? It has more words than any other language. The grammar is simpler than in other major languages. However, English spelling is difficult. Foreigners all have trouble spelling English. So do native speakers! Since 1880, people have invented over fifty artificial (not natural) languages. No one speaks them as a native language. However, none of them has ever become popular. Some people don't want to study English, but it is the international language. There is no way to change that now. Question: England started a colony in India in the    _   .

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What part of the church did Nikolova consider unsuitable for the baptism? ?  The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are many possible goals you could set, but the type of goal refers to how you'll measure your progress and success. The two main types are process goals and outcome goals.  Process goals focus on the work that you'll do within a given time period. An example of a process goal would be to complete and submit all of your assignments on time this week. Outcome goals focus on the results of your work. An example of an outcome goal would be to earn a grade of at least 90% on your next test. Having a goal may not be enough to keep you motivated. If that's the case, it may be important to remind yourself of why that goal is meaningful to you, and why you hope to achieve it.

QUESTION 1: To find the radius of the incircle of a triangle, we can use the formula: radius = area / semiperimeter First, we need to find the area and the semiperimeter of the triangle. The semiperimeter of the triangle can be found using the formula: semiperimeter = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2 semiperimeter = (18 + 24 + 30) / 2 semiperimeter = 72 / 2 semiperimeter = 36 Next, we can use the Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle: area = sqrt(semiperimeter * (semiperimeter - side1) * (semiperimeter - side2) * (semiperimeter - side3)) area = sqrt(36 * (36 - 18) * (36 - 24) * (36 - 30)) area = sqrt(36 * 18 * 12 * 6) area = sqrt(52488) area ≈ 229.13 cm^2 Now I can find the radius using the formula: radius = area / semiperimeter radius = 229.13 / 36 radius ≈ 6.365 cm The radius of the incircle of the triangle is approximately 6.365 cm. QUESTION 2: To find the area of a triangle with side lengths 3, 2, and 1 cm, first, we need to check if this triangle can exist. In order for a triangle to exist, the sum of the lengths of its two smaller sides must be greater than the length of the largest side. For this triangle, 1 + 2 = 3, which is not greater than the length of the largest side. Therefore, this triangle cannot exist, and we cannot find its area.

The first question asks for the radius of the incircle of a triangle with given side lengths, while the second question asks for the area of a triangle with given side lengths.

Burton himself won 12 Emmy awards as host and producer of the show.  After Reading Rainbow went off the air in 2006, Burton and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, acquired the global rights to the brand and formed RRKIDZ, a new media company for children. Reading Rainbow was reimagined as an all new application for the iPad in 2012, and was an immediate success, becoming the number-one educational application within 36 hours. At RRKIDZ, Burton serves as co-founder and curator-in-chief, ensuring that the projects produced under the banner meet the high expectations and trust of the Reading Rainbow brand.  On May 28, 2014, Burton and numerous coworkers from other past works started a Kickstarter campaign project to bring back Reading Rainbow. To keep with the changing formats to which young children are exposed, his efforts are being directed at making this new program web-based, following the success of the tablet application he helped create in recent years. His desire is to have the new Reading Rainbow be integrated into the classrooms of elementary schools across the country, and for schools in need to have free access. The Kickstarter campaign has since raised over 5 million, reaching triple its goal in only three days. Question: What is the goal of the campaign? Answer:","output":"The goal of the campaign is to bring back the Reading Rainbow program in a new, web-based format. They want to make it a part of elementary school classrooms all over the country. Also, they hope to provide free access to schools that really need it. This is because they want to help all kids learn to love reading, just like the Reading Rainbow show did when it was on TV."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Then, make a seal around their mouth with your mouth, breathe in and blow the breath into their mouth. You should see their chest rise as you deliver the rescue breath and then fall as you remove your mouth from their mouth. Deliver one breath every five seconds. Prepare the nasal syringe immediately after giving several rescue breaths (if necessary). Pry or pull off the yellow caps. There are usually two – one at each end of the syringe.  A syringe is not a needle, it's a plastic device that holds the needle – or in this case, what the Narcan screws onto. You can find Narcan through the getnaloxonenow.org website.

Researchers say long working hours could be condemning thousands of employees to heart attacks and strokes. The warning follows analysis of 12 studies dating back as far as 1958, involving a total of 22,000 people from around the world. Time for a holiday: Research shows that employees who frequently put in overtime significantly increase their risk of heart attacks and strokes. The analysis, by scientists at the. Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, found that those whose working. days that were longer than the traditional eight hours had a 40 to 80. per cent greater chance of heart disease. The size of the increase varied depending on how each study was carried out. The effects were more pronounced when. participants were asked how long they worked for – but when researchers. closely monitored working hours, the increased risk of heart disease was. closer to 40 per cent. Lead researcher Dr Marianna Virtanen. said the effects could be due to 'prolonged exposure to stress'. Other. triggers could be poor eating habits and lack of exercise due to. restricted leisure time. In 2009, the same team discovered. that long working hours increased the risk of dementia later in life. The effect was similar in magnitude to that of smoking. Calm down: Prolonged exposure to psychological stress, which can occur at work, may be one reason for the link between longer hours and heart disease. Middle-aged workers putting in 55. hours or more a week had poorer brain function than those clocking up no. more than 40 hours, with lower scores on tests to measure intelligence,. short-term memory and word recall. Britons work some of the longest hours. in Europe, with full-time employees averaging 42.7 a week. Those in. Germany typically work for 42, while Danes do 39.1. It estimated that more than five million people a year in Britain work unpaid extra hours to hang on to their jobs. But the long-term toll on workers’ health could be devastating, the new research suggests. In a report on the findings Dr Virtanen said: ‘There are several potential mechanisms that may underlie the association between long working hours and heart disease. In addition to prolonged exposure to psychological stress she said other triggers could be raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol, poor eating habits and lack of physical activity due to restricted leisure time.

Over the years 29 residence halls have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well. Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey.

Does \\"However, in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability, and hunting for 'population control' has no effect on the annual population of species.[citation needed]\\" correctly answer the question of What happens if a population exceeds the carrying capacity of their habitat?","output":"The given statement, \\"However, in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination of habitat and food availability, and hunting for 'population control' has no effect on the annual population of species.[citation needed]\\" only partially answers the question of what happens if a population exceeds the carrying capacity of their habitat. While it does mention important factors – habitat and food availability – that determine the carrying capacity, it does not fully explain the consequences of exceeding carrying capacity, nor does it explain how population control measures such as hunting fit into the discussion. Carrying capacity is a concept used in population ecology to describe the maximum population size that an environment can sustainably support without resource depletion and long-term damage to the ecosystem. When a population exceeds its carrying capacity, various consequences arise, including: 1. Competition for resources: As a population grows beyond its carrying capacity, the demand for resources, such as food, water, and shelter, increases. This leads to competition among individuals, resulting in some being unable to obtain the resources they need to survive, ultimately leading to a decline in population size. 2. Uncontrolled population fluctuations: When a population exceeds its carrying capacity, it can cause sharp fluctuations in population numbers as the population grows rapidly and then suddenly crashes when resources are depleted. This can lead to destabilization of the ecosystem and make it difficult for the species to recover. 3. Decline in overall health: Overcrowding and increased competition for resources can contribute to malnutrition, disease, and stress among the population, leading to a decrease in overall health and potentially resulting in increased mortality. 4. Ecosystem degradation: A population that surpasses its carrying capacity can cause damage to the environment, such as overgrazing, nutrient depletion in soil, and habitat destruction. These changes can have long-term effects on the health and stability of the ecosystem, impacting not only the species in question but also other species that rely on the same resources and habitat. Regarding the role of hunting in population control, this statement suggests that hunting may not always affect the annual population of a species. However, this can vary significantly depending on the specific species and ecosystem in question. In some cases, carefully regulated hunting can contribute to a more balanced and healthier ecosystem by preventing overpopulation and reducing competition for resources. In other cases, hunting may not significantly impact the overall population size if reproduction rates or other factors balance out the population numbers over time. In conclusion, the given statement partially answers the question but could be expanded to better address the consequences of exceeding carrying capacity and discuss the potential role of measures such as hunting in managing population size. A more thorough understanding of the outcomes of exceeding carrying capacity is essential for making informed decisions regarding conservation, resource management, and population control strategies."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Max Renn (James Woods) is the president of CIVIC-TV (Channel 83, Cable 12), a Toronto UHF television station specializing in sensationalistic programming. Displeased with his station's current lineup (which mostly consists of softcore pornography and gratuitous violence), Max is looking for something that will break through to a new audience. One morning, he is summoned to the clandestine office of Harlan (Peter Dvorsky), who operates CIVIC-TV's unauthorized satellite dish which can intercept broadcasts from as far away as Asia. Harlan shows him Videodrome, a plotless television show apparently being broadcast out of Malaysia which depicts the brutal torture and eventual murder of anonymous victims in a reddish-orange chamber. Believing this to be the future of televisionâ(staged) snuff TVâMax orders Harlan to begin unlicensed use of the show. Appearing on a talk show, Max defends his station's programming choices to Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry), a sadomasochistic psychiatrist and radio host, and Professor Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley), a pop-culture analyst and philosopher who will only appear on television if his image is broadcast into the studio, onto a television, from a remote location.

Build a movie plot around this: who vanished on October 31,1978 after being shot six times and falling from a second story balcony? Michael Myers A:","output":"Title: The Eternal Nightmare Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller  Plot: The small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, has always been haunted by the eerie events that occurred on October 31, 1978. The infamous serial murderer, Michael Myers, was shot six times by psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis and fell from a second story balcony, after which he simply vanished without a trace. In present day, Haddonfield has largely forgotten about Michael Myers, choosing instead to focus on the revival of their community and try to leave the past where it's meant to be - in the past. However, in the weeks leading up to another fateful Halloween night, strange occurrences begin to plague the town and cause unrest among its residents. The story follows Emma, a local investigative journalist who grew up hearing the terrifying stories of Michael Myers, which ultimately inspired her to dig even deeper into the gruesome mysteries that seem to live deep within the roots of Haddonfield. As Emma starts revealing long-held secrets and unanswered questions, she stumbles upon the hidden truth - the real identity of the person who pulled the trigger on Michael Myers that fateful night and the implication this shocking discovery has on the town's supposed safety. The town's dark history comes to light as Emma uncovers information about a secret operation led by the now-retired Dr. Sam Loomis, who had discovered a way to suppress Michael's supernatural ability to resist death in order to protect the world from his terror. Unbeknownst to the town, this intervention left him in a dormant state, hidden away in a secret facility for decades. Emma's discoveries inadvertently awaken Michael Myers from his slumber, reigniting the cycle of terror he had once haunted Haddonfield with. With Michael now stronger and more unstoppable than ever, Emma must join forces with a new generation of brave and determined individuals, including the town's brave sheriff, a dedicated forensic analyst, and the only surviving member of Dr. Loomis' original team, Rick. The group embarks on a harrowing mission to prevent Michael from leaving a trail of death in his wake; however, as Halloween night casts a dark spell over Haddonfield, they quickly realize that the shadow of Michael Myers is almost inescapable. Realizing that they need to outsmart and trap Michael, Emma discovers an ancient ritual connected to the origins of Michael's dark presence and existence. With time running out and lives on the line, the group must band together to execute a risky plan - performing the ritual to strip Michael of his immortality. The climax of the film culminates in a labyrinth-like haunted house attraction set by the townspeople as a distraction and a trap. Michael, engaged in a non-stop chase, relentlessly pursues Emma and her team. As the clock strikes midnight, the ancient ritual succeeds in making Michael Myers mortal again, allowing the team to confront and finally put an end to the terror of Michael Myers as the haunted house collapses around them. The movie closes with the town of Haddonfield coming to terms with the true dark secrets it has been hiding. The residents, now free from the nightmarish curse of The Eternal Nightmare, work together to rebuild their community and heal the wounds from decades of fear and pain. The legend of Michael Myers may never be forgotten, but Haddonfield rises stronger and more united with the hope of never having to experience such terror again."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],j={key:0},D={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
