Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of mechanics.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Clinton \\"Clint\\" Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, filmmaker, musician, and political figure. After earning success in the Western TV series \\"Rawhide\\", he rose to international fame with his role as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's \\"Dollars\\" trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five \\"Dirty Harry\\" films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.  - Rhodesia, commonly known from 1970 onwards as the Republic of Rhodesia, was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territorial terms to modern Zimbabwe. With its capital in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia was considered a \\"de facto\\" successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia (which had achieved responsible government in 1923).  - Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western (primarily in Japan), is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success. The term was used by American critics and other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.  - The Man with No Name is the protagonist portrayed by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's \\"Dollars Trilogy\\" of Spaghetti Western films: \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" (1964), \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" (1965) and \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" (1966). He is easily recognizable due to his iconic brown hat, green poncho, tan cowboy boots, fondness for cigarillos and the fact that he rarely talks. Since he never received a name in any of the films, he is conventionally known as \\"the man with no name\\". When Clint Eastwood was honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996 Jim Carrey held the introductory speech and said: \\"'The Man With No Name' had no name, so we could fill in our own.\\" In 2008, \\"Empire\\" chose the Man With No Name as the 33rd greatest movie character of all time.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - An antihero, or antiheroine, is a protagonist who lacks conventional heroic qualities such as idealism, courage, or morality. These characters are usually considered \\"conspicuously contrary to an archetypal hero\\". Antihero is not a villain. A villain is just the enemy of the hero although a antihero is a hero who is unsual, who doesn't look like a traditionel hero.  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California.

The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.  - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.  - Carlos Ray \\"Chuck\\" Norris (born March 10, 1940) is an American martial artist, actor, film producer and screenwriter.

Clint Eastwood plays the title role, in his first outing as San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Inspector \\"Dirty\\" Harry Callahan. The film drew upon the actual case of the Zodiac Killer as the Callahan character seeks out a similar vicious psychopath.  - The Rhodesian Bush Waralso known as the Second Chimurenga or the Zimbabwe War of Liberationwas a civil war that took place from July 1964 to December 1979 in the unrecognised country of Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe-Rhodesia). The conflict pitted three forces against one another: the Rhodesian government, under Ian Smith (later the Zimbabwe Rhodesian government of Bishop Abel Muzorewa); the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, the military wing of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union; and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Sergio Leone (3 January 1929  30 April 1989) was an Italian film director, producer and screenwriter, credited as the inventor of the \\"Spaghetti Western\\" genre.  - The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who operated in northern California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The killer's identity remains unknown. The Zodiac murdered victims in Benicia, Vallejo, Lake Berryessa, and San Francisco between December 1968 and October 1969. Four men and three women between the ages of 16 and 29 were targeted. The killer originated the name \\"Zodiac\\" in a series of taunting letters sent to the local Bay Area press. These letters included four cryptograms (or ciphers). Of the four cryptograms sent, only one has been definitively solved.  - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Dorothy Day, Obl.S.B. (November 8, 1897 - November 29, 1980) was an American journalist, social activist, and Catholic convert. Day initially lived a bohemian lifestyle before gaining fame as a social activist after her conversion. She later became a key figure in the Catholic Worker Movement and earned a national reputation as a political radical, perhaps the most famous radical in American Catholic Church history. Dorothy Day was born on November 8, 1897, in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. She was born into a family described by one biographer as \\"solid, patriotic, and middle class\\". Her father, John Day, was a Tennessee native of Irish heritage, while her mother, Grace Satterlee, a native of upstate New York, was of English ancestry. Her parents were married in an Episcopal church in Greenwich Village. She had three brothers and a sister. In 1904, her father, who was a sports writer devoted to horse racing, took a position with a newspaper in San Francisco. The family lived in Oakland, California, until the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 destroyed the newspaper's facilities and her father lost his job. From the spontaneous response to the earthquake's devastation, the self-sacrifice of neighbors in a time of crisis, Day drew a lesson about individual action and Christian community. The family relocated to Chicago.  Day's parents were nominal Christians who rarely attended church. As a young child, she showed a marked religious streak, reading the Bible frequently. When she was ten she started to attend Church of Our Saviour, an Episcopal church in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, after its rector convinced her mother to let Day's brothers join the church choir. She was taken with the liturgy and its music. She studied the catechism and was baptized and confirmed in that church in 1911.  Day was an avid reader in her teens, particularly fond of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. She worked from one book to another, noting Jack London's mention of Herbert Spencer in Martin Eden, and then from Spencer to Darwin and Huxley. She learned about anarchy and extreme poverty from Peter Kropotkin, who promoted a belief in cooperation in contrast to Darwin's competition for survival. She also enjoyed Russian literature in university, especially Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Gorky. Day read a lot of socially conscious work, which gave her a background for her future; it helped bolster her support for and involvement in social activism.  In 1914, Day attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on a scholarship. She was a reluctant scholar. Her reading was chiefly in a Christian radical social direction. She avoided campus social life and supported herself rather than rely on money from her father, buying all her clothing and shoes from discount stores. She left the university after two years and moved to New York City. who were her parents?","output":"Dorothy Day's parents were John Day and Grace Satterlee.

Summarize: There are many different styles and cuts that poodle owners can choose from. Some common cuts are the Puppy Clip, the Continental Clip, and the Bikini Clip. While there are other grooming options, these are the most common.  Consult a professional groomer on which cuts would be best for your dog. Remember, if you’re doing most of your dog’s grooming at home, you’ll need to commit to a certain amount of time and effort. Some cuts are easier to style and maintain than others. All of the common styles involve trimming or shaving the poodle’s face, feet, and the base of the tail.  The style of the poodle’s body fur changes significantly based on the chosen clip. Though it may seem tempting to buy a cheaper pair of clippers or scissors, getting a higher-quality product will be better for your dog.  Better clippers are less likely to scrape your dog’s skin or pull his fur while cutting. A cordless clipper will make the grooming much easier for you!  High-quality clippers such as Laube, Andis, or Oster cost around 125-175.  They should last much longer than their less expensive counterparts. Note that many groomers seem to prefer Andis or Laube over Oster, as Oster clipper blades can heat during trimming.  If you do use Oster, you may want to have extra blades of the same size so that you can switch them out if they become heated.  Good scissors made for grooming may cost around 50.  These scissors should be sharp and comfortable for you to cut with.  You may want to try out different models before purchasing them. Clippers have interchangeable blades that are numbered to indicate the length that they will leave the fur after trimming, with higher numbers indicating shorter fur. You will likely need a variety of clipper blades: start with a 5, 7, 10, 15, and 30.  If you cannot afford to get many different blades or you’re just starting out, begin with at 10 or 15. Be aware that use of 30 and 40 blades can be quite difficult and should usually be left to experienced or professional groomers.  Improper use of these (very short) blades can scrape or burn your poodle’s skin. Trimming takes some time, and if your pup is well-rested, he may not sit still long enough for you to finish.  Taking him to the park or on a long walk for exercise before you begin may lead to a more cooperative subject. Before you begin clipping, turn the clippers on around your dog.  This is especially important for a puppy or a poodle who has not been regularly groomed.  Over time, your dog should become more and more comfortable being around the clippers. You may want to have a professional groomer clip your poodle the first few times so that you do not have to worry about both introducing your dog to the clippers and learning to clip the fur.","output":"Poodle owners have various grooming options and styles to choose from, including the Puppy Clip, Continental Clip, and Bikini Clip.

Before trimming, it is advised to exercise the dog for a more comfortable experience. Also, introduce the clippers to the dog, especially if they are a puppy or not used to grooming.

Meanwhile, the other cats watch attentively from a distance, with both curiosity and apprehension. The person takes note of this and makes a mental note to reward each feline with treats or affection after the nail trimming session has concluded. As the person finishes with the grey tabby, they proceed to a large, orange cat who appears more hesitant and less cooperative. Rather than forcing the cat into submission, they instead take a moment to offer a gentle scratch under the chin and slowly introduce the nail clippers. They gently press on the base of each claw to extend them one at a time and meticulously trim the tips, being cautious not to come close to the quick. Throughout the process, the individual speaks in a gentle, comforting voice while explaining to the felines the importance of maintaining healthy nails and avoiding potential harm both to themselves and the environment. With the clipping activity over, the person rewards each cat with a small treat and praises them for their patience. The atmosphere in the room becomes noticeably more relaxed as the cats realize the ordeal is over. They each come up to the person willingly, rubbing against their legs and purring affectionately, as if to say \\"thank you\\" for taking care of their well-being. The brown, white, black, grey, and orange cats form a circle around the person, who then retrieves a favorite toy and begins a lively play session with the whole group. In taking the time to calmly and carefully clip the claws of each of these different cats, the person showed not only skill and attention to detail, but also a true understanding of the importance of patience and compassion when working with animals.

Radio waves are used for various communication purposes, such as television and radio broadcasting, mobile phone signals, and satellite communication. 2. Microwaves: With wavelengths ranging from 1 millimeter to 1 meter and frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz, microwaves are used for different applications, including microwave ovens, radar systems, and wireless communication technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. 3. Infrared (IR) radiation: Infrared radiation has wavelengths that range from 750 nanometers to 1 millimeter and frequencies between 300 GHz and 400 THz. It's emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero and is used in multiple applications, such as thermal imaging, night vision, remote sensing, and telecommunications. 4. Visible light: This is the only portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible light has wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers and frequencies between 400 THz and 790 THz. It is responsible for our ability to see colors and plays a critical role in photosynthesis in plants. 5. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation: With wavelengths between 10 and 400 nanometers and frequencies between 790 THz and 30 PHz, ultraviolet radiation is invisible to the human eye. It has various applications, such as germicidal lamps, tanning beds, and blacklight. It's also responsible for causing sunburn and can damage DNA, leading to skin cancer. 6. X-rays: These high-energy waves have wavelengths ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers and frequencies between 30 PHz and 30 EHz. X-rays can penetrate various materials, making them essential in medical imaging, security scanning, and material analysis. 7. Gamma rays: These are the highest energy waves in the electromagnetic spectrum, with wavelengths smaller than 0.01 nanometers and frequencies greater than 30 EHz. Gamma rays are emitted by processes in the atomic nucleus and have applications in cancer treatment, astronomical observations, and nuclear energy research. In summary, the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses the full range of radiant energy emitted and transmitted as electromagnetic waves. From radio waves to gamma rays, each region of the spectrum presents unique properties and applications across various fields like communication, medicine, astronomy, and energy."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Charley Brewster is a teenager living in a suburb of Las Vegas, Nevada, who discovers that a new neighbor has moved in next door.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. . An anemometer is a tool for measuring wind speed. You can buy one online, or make a simple one yourself in about 30 minutes using the steps below. If you bought one, skip down to the step in which you count the rotations – or just read the wind speed directly, if yours has a digital display. Take four small paper cups, and punch a single hole in each one, about ½ inch (1.25 cm) below the rim. Take a fifth cup, and puncture four evenly spaced holes, about ¼ in. (6 mm) below the rim, then punch a fifth hole in the center of its base. You can use a pencil to punch these holes, if you don't have anything sharper. Stick a plastic straw into a single-hole cup, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) into it. Push the other end of the straw through two holes of the five-hole cup. Stick the free end of the straw into another single-hole cup. Turn the two single-hole cups so they are pointing in opposite directions, along the same plane as the straw. Staple the straw to the cup. Repeat with another straw, putting it through the remaining two holes of the central five-hole cup. Rotate these two new cups until each cup opening is nearer the base of the next one. In other words, the top cup points right, the right cup points down, the bottom cup points left, and the left cup points up. Staple the straws and cups together. Slide the two straws until all four cups are the same distance from the center. Stick a small pin through the intersection of the two straws. Stick the eraser end of a pencil through the hole in the base of the central cup, and push it gently onto the pin. You can now hold the anemometer by the pencil tip, and use it to measure wind speeds. Hold the anemometer upright in a windy area. Watch a single cup (draw on it with a marker if it makes it easier to follow) and count the number of times it rotates. Use a stopwatch or a friend watching the second hand of a clock to time 15 seconds, and stop you when the time is up. Multiply your count by four to get the number of revolutions per minute (rpm). For greater accuracy, count the number of rotations in 60 seconds (and don't multiply by anything). Measure the distance from one edge of the anemometer to the other to find the diameter of the rotating circle, d. The circumference of the circle, is equal to πd. This is the distance traveled in one revolution. If you don't have a calculator, you can use 3.14 as an estimate of π, or even just 3 for a rough estimate. Convert the circumference you calculated into a more useful unit for measuring wind speed (miles or kilometers). Multiply the result by the rpm you calculated to get the total distance traveled in one minute. Multiply the result by 60 to get the distance traveled in one hour (mph or km/h). Here are the full formulas in imperial and metric units:  Imperial: (__circumference__ inches/revolution) * (1/12 ft/inches) * (1/5280 miles/ft) * (__rpm__ revolutions/minute) * (60 minutes/hour) = __wind speed__ in miles per hour. Metric: (__circumference__ centimeters/revolution) * (1/100000 kilometers/centimeter) * (__rpm__ revolutions/minute) * (60 minutes/hour) = __wind speed__ in kilometers per hour.","output":"An anemometer is a tool that measures wind speed, and you can make a simple one with paper cups, straws, a pencil, and a pin to count the number of rotations to find out the wind speed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - Austrofascism was the authoritarian rule installed in Austria with the May Constitution of 1934, which ceased with the annexation of the newly founded Federal State of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938. It was based on a ruling party, the Fatherland Front (\\"Vaterländische Front\\") and the Heimwehr (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were Engelbert Dollfuss and, after Dollfuss's assassination, Kurt Schuschnigg, who were previously politicians of the Christian Social Party, which was quickly integrated into the new movement.  - Engelbert Dollfuss (; October 4, 1892  July 25, 1934) was an Austrian Christian Social and Patriotic Front statesman. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the Austrian Nazi party and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934, he cemented the rule of austrofascism through the authoritarian \\"First of May Constitution\\". Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents in 1934. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitlers annexation of Austria in 1938.  - The Kingdom of Italy was a state founded from 1861, when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy, to 1946, when a constitutional referendum led civil discontent to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic. The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state.  - The Heimwehr (\\"Home Guard\\") or sometimes Heimatschutz (\\"Homeland Protection\\") were a nationalist, initially paramilitary group operating within Austria during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's Freikorps. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the Heimatblock, which cooperated with Engelbert Dollfuss' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the Fatherland Front by decree of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the \\"Frontmiliz\\".  - Italian Fascism, also known simply as Fascism, is the original fascist ideology, as developed in Italy. The ideology is associated with the National Fascist Party, which under Benito Mussolini ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 until 1943, the Republican Fascist Party that ruled the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945, the post-war Italian Social Movement and subsequent Italian neo-fascist movements.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before it spread to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional leftright spectrum.  - The National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\", PNF) was an Italian political party, created by Benito Mussolini as the political expression of fascism (previously represented by groups known as \\"Fasci\\"). The party ruled Italy from 1922 when Fascists took power with the March on Rome, to 1943, when Mussolini was deposed by the Grand Council of Fascism.  - Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (29 July 1883  28 April 1945) was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\"; PNF), ruling the country as Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943. He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Known as \\"Il Duce\\" (The Leader), Mussolini was the founder of Italian Fascism.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg (14 December 1897  18 November 1977) was Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 \\"Anschluss\\" with Nazi Germany. He was opposed to Hitler's ambitions to absorb Austria into the Third Reich.  - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.  - The Italian Social Republic, informally known as the Republic of Salò, was a state with limited recognition that was created during the later part of World War II (in existence from 1943 until 1945). Mussolini had originally intended to call his new republic the Italian Socialist Republic. It was the second and last incarnation of the Fascist Italian state and was led by Duce Benito Mussolini and his reformed Republican Fascist Party. The state declared Rome as its capital, but was \\"de facto\\" centered on Salò (hence its colloquial name), a small town on Lake Garda, near Brescia, where Mussolini and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was headquartered. The RSI exercised nominal sovereignty in northern and central Italy, but was largely dependent on German troops to maintain control.  - The Republican Fascist Party (PFR) was a political party led by Benito Mussolini during the German occupation of Central and Northern Italy. It was founded as the successor of former National Fascist Party as an anti-monarchist party. It considered King Victor Emmanuel III to be a traitor after he had signed the surrender to the Allied powers.  - The Fatherland Front ( German : Vaterländische Front , VF ) was the ruling political organisation of \`\` Austrofascism '' . It claimed to be a nonpartisan movement , and aimed to unite all the people of Austria , overcoming political and social divisions . Established on 20 May 1933 by Christian Social Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss as a one - party along the lines of Italian Fascism , it advocated Austrian nationalism and independence from Nazi Germany on the basis of protecting Austria 's Catholic religious identity from what they considered a Protestant - dominated German state . The Fatherland Front which was strongly linked with Austria 's Catholic clergy , absorbed Dollfuss 's Christian Social Party , the agrarian Landbund and the right - wing paramilitary Heimwehren , all of which were opposed to socialism , free - market capitalism and liberal democracy . It established an authoritarian and corporatist regime , the Federal State of Austria , which is commonly known in German as the Ständestaat ( \`\` corporate state '' ) . According to the Fatherland Front , this form of government and society implemented the social teaching of Pope Pius XI 's 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo anno . The Front banned and persecuted all its political opponents , including Communists , Social Democrats -- who fought against it in a brief Civil War in February 1934 -- but also the Austrian Nazis who wanted Austria to join Hitler 's Greater German Empire . Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated by the Nazis in July 1934 . He was succeeded as leader of the VF and Chancellor of Austria by Kurt Schuschnigg , who ruled until the invigorated Nazis forced him to resign on 11 March 1938 . Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany the next day . The Fatherland Front maintained a cultural and recreational organisation , called \`\` New Life '' ( Neues Leben ) , similar to Germany 's Strength Through Joy .

The Public Health Wales dental survey showed those from the most-deprived backgrounds have had the biggest reduction over the last decade. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said he was \\"pleased\\" by the progress. But chief dental officer, Dr Colette Bridgeman, said there was still \\"scope for improvement\\". The report, based on a survey of about 8,000 five-year-old children at more than 500 schools in Wales in 2015-2016, is the latest carried out by the Welsh Oral Health Information Unit. It showed in 2007-08, about 14 out of a class of 30 (47.6%) children had decay, with an average of 4.2 teeth affected. But by last year, this had fallen to about 10 children out of a class of 30 (34.2%), with an average of 3.6 teeth affected. Only Cwm Taf University Health Board has not seen a \\"statistically and clinically significant reduction\\" in tooth decay among this age group, the report said. It said dental disease levels in children in Wales continued to improve across all social groups, with the most deprived fifth seeing the largest reduction in decay - 15%. This improvement is \\"likely to be due to the impact\\" of the Welsh Government's Designed to Smile programme, a scheme introduced in 2009, which encourages children to brush their teeth and provides dental care equipment. The report said that, while there had been \\"great improvements\\" over the last nine years, there is plenty of scope for further improvement for the third of children still experiencing decay. Dr Bridgeman said, typically, half of decay experienced by five-year-olds will have been evident from when they were three, so the government was \\"re-focussing\\" Designed to Smile on children aged zero to five.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who is amused by Drake's jokes? is inside the article: Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\".  Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression.

A microwave is an electromagnetic wave with a relatively long wavelength and low frequency. Microwaves are often classified as radio waves, but they have higher frequencies than other radio waves. With higher frequencies, they also have more energy. That’s why microwaves are useful for heating food in microwave ovens. Microwaves have other important uses as well, including cell phone transmissions and radar. These uses are described below. You can learn more about microwaves and their uses in the video at this URL: http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=YgQQb1BVnu8 .   Q: Why do microwaves have a higher energy than radio waves?   Choices:  - higher resonance  - lower frequency  - higher decibel  - higher frequency  A:","output":"Microwaves have a higher energy than radio waves because they have a higher frequency.  Frequency refers to the number of wave cycles that pass a given point per unit of time. In the electromagnetic spectrum, different types of waves represent different ranges of frequencies. Microwaves and radio waves both belong to this spectrum, but they occupy different frequency ranges.  Radio waves have a lower frequency range, which usually falls between 3 kHz and 300 GHz. On the other hand, microwaves possess a higher frequency range, typically between 300 MHz and 300 GHz. This higher frequency means that microwaves can oscillate or vibrate at a much faster rate than radio waves. According to Planck's equation, the energy of a photon (a particle-like component of an electromagnetic wave) is directly proportional to its frequency. The equation is given as E = h × f, where E represents energy, h denotes Planck's constant, and f signifies frequency. Consequently, if a wave has a higher frequency, it will also possess a greater energy. Therefore, microwaves have a higher energy than radio waves due to their higher frequency. This greater energy allows microwaves to be effective in various applications, such as heating food in microwave ovens, transmitting cell phone signals, and functioning in radar systems, as mentioned in the paragraph provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Find truth: Seeking the truth implies searching for accurate and reliable information, which would directly address ignorance. 3. Judge: This choice doesn't help address ignorance as it doesn't involve gaining knowledge or understanding. 4. Judgement: Similar to \\"judge,\\" judgement alone doesn't directly address ignorance. 5. Learn about subject: This choice is a valid option since learning about a specific subject would help combat ignorance in that subject area. However, it may lack the broader perspective that \\"find truth\\" provides.

Which British Blue Peter presenter is attempting, in January 2012, to get to the South Pole on a variety modes of transport - including a bike and kite ski?","output":"In January 2012, British Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton attempted to reach the South Pole using a variety of modes of transport, including bike and kite ski, as a part of the Polar Challenge for Sport Relief. Helen Skelton was born on July 19, 1983, in Carlisle, Cumbria, England. She began her presenting career at the esteemed BBC children's program Blue Peter in August 2008. Known for her daring and adventurous spirit, Skelton has taken on several endurance challenges throughout her tenure on the popular show. The Polar Challenge for Sport Relief was a unique expedition undertaken by Skelton to raise awareness and funds for the charity organization Sport Relief, which supports vulnerable and disadvantaged people in the UK and worldwide. The challenge saw her embark on a grueling 500-mile journey across the icy terrain of Antarctica—a feat made even more difficult by the fact that she had to rely on several unconventional modes of transportation. Skelton started her journey on a bicycle specifically designed for icy conditions, followed by periods of cross-country skiing while hauling a sled filled with all her supplies. When wind conditions were favorable, she made use of large kite skis to harness the power of the wind and propel herself forward. Each of these methods of transportation enabled her to cover ground more efficiently while conserving as much energy as possible in the unforgiving Antarctic environment. Skelton also faced harsh weather conditions including extreme cold, high winds, and whiteouts that tested her physical and mental resilience. The arduous journey Helen Skelton took to reach the South Pole reflects her dedication to supporting worthy causes, as well as her adventurous spirit. Throughout her approximately 18-day endeavor, she set two Guinness World Records: one for the longest bicycle journey on snow (100.22 miles) and another for the fastest 100 kilometers (62 miles) by kite ski (7 hours and 28 minutes). Skelton's incredible Antarctic adventure showcased her determination and commitment, inspiring many people and raising a significant amount of funds for Sport Relief.

Options: [-] find the stray's home; [-] did this to avoid problems; [-] did this to punish the dog; I heard that Jordan controlled his dog when a stray ran into the yard.  And I was wondering Why did Jordan do this? Answer:","output":"Jordan's decision to control his dog when a stray entered the yard was a calculated and responsible action, owing to several factors. The primary reasons for this choice were to find the stray's home, avoid problems, and prevent any harm or punishment to the dog from arising out of the situation. 1. Find the stray's home: One of the reasons Jordan controlled his dog was to provide an opportunity to find the stray's home. It might be possible that the stray dog was lost, frightened, or accidentally ended up in Jordan's yard. By ensuring his dog wouldn't interfere, Jordan created a safe environment to approach the stray and check for any identification, such as a collar or a tag, which would help in returning the lost dog to its rightful owner. This underscores Jordan's compassionate nature and indicates his desire to assist not just his dog but also other animals in need. 2. Avoid problems: Controlling his dog in this situation also prevented potential problems that could arise in case of a dog fight or an altercation. When dogs interact, especially if one is territorial or apprehensive of the other, conflicts may easily escalate and lead to injuries or damages. By restraining his dog and keeping them away from the stray, Jordan was able to minimize the risk of conflicts and maintain a safe and harmonious environment in his yard. Additionally, it is a possibility that the stray dog could be carrying diseases or infections, which can be contagious to other dogs. Protecting his dog by creating distance becomes a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of any illnesses. 3. Did this to punish the dog: It is important to clarify that Jordan's intent was not to punish his dog, but rather to ensure its safety and well-being. Jordan understood that the presence of an unfamiliar dog in the yard could cause tension and distress for his pet, potentially leading to an adverse response. By maintaining control over his dog, Jordan focused on de-escalating the situation and ensuring that both animals remained unharmed. In conclusion, Jordan's actions were rooted in care and concern, with the intention to protect both his dog and the stray animal. By keeping the situation under control, Jordan was able to peacefully resolve the situation, avoid potential problems, and even assist the stray dog in finding its way back home. Through his thoughtful and responsible approach, Jordan demonstrated empathy and awareness, qualities that are commendable in a pet owner."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write some highlights for the following article: Not many people would see quadriplegia as a gift. But then, not many people are Paul Callahan. As a 21-year-old Harvard University student, Paul's life was full of possibility. An undergraduate studying business at one of the best universities in the world, there was a lot to look forward to for the young man from Massachusetts. Then a freak accident changed everything. Paul slipped on a wet floor, breaking his neck and rendering him paralyzed from the chest down. He retained the use of his arms, but not his hands. Callahan spent the next five years traveling to rehabilitation centers across the United States in search of a way to walk again. When a doctor finally suggested it was time to concentrate on living instead of walking, Paul did exactly that. Almost 30 years later, the 55-year-old father of two is now set to represent the United States in sailing at the Paralympics. \\"It's an evolutionary process where you transition from one life to the other,\\" Paul told CNN. \\"I never gave up moving forward. You can define that as walking or being a contributing member of society. At 26 I chose the later.\\" Golden hopes. Next week Paul and his two team mates -- both amputees -- will take to a 24-foot boat for the three-person sailing event at the Paralympics. Skipper Paul drives the boat by wearing rollerblading gloves on his hands, attached to bicycle pedals. The pedals are in turn linked to a pulley system that steers the vessel. This will be Paul's second Paralympics, after his debut at Sydney in 2000. The U.S. team failed to win a medal, but as Paul admits he was still fresh to the sport. With a fifth place in the Disabled Sailing World Championships in Weymouth last year, this time gold is on the cards, he insists. Watch: Sailing for social change. It would be an incredible achievement in a life already marked by success. Paul returned to Harvard in 1983, becoming the first quadriplegic to graduate from the university. He then went on to work at Goldman Sachs as an asset manager for 15 years. \\"Everyone is quite capable of doing much more than they think they can,\\" Paul said. \\"Once they realize that fact, then the world becomes their oyster.\\" Sail to Prevail. It was a chance sailing trip in 1995 that sparked Paul's love for the sport -- and a new venture that would help thousands of disabled children. \\"I got on a sailboat and looked back at my empty wheelchair on the dock,\\" Paul said. \\"It was the first time in 15 years I was able to do something on my own. It was an incredible moment.\\" So inspiring was the experience, Callahan left his Wall Street job and took over Sail to Prevail -- a non-profit organization that teaches disabled children to sail. Watch: Sailing solo around the world. From starting with eight children a year, the charity, based in Newport, Rhode Island, now helps around 1,000 youngsters annually. Their disabilities vary from spinal cord injuries to autism, and Paul says when he races for gold next month, it'll be for them. \\"When we get on the starting line against 14 other countries, I want to win a gold medal just as much as they do -- but I've got an additional motivation,\\" he said. \\"The better my team does, the more powerful impact it will have for Sail to Prevail.\\" The gift. It is perhaps a testament to Paul's mental strength that he views his disability as a special opportunity in life. \\"I've been given an extraordinary gift where I can affect people's lives in ways other people can't. So I see it as a responsibility,\\" he said. There have been some dark moments Paul admits. But with his wife, Alisa, 9-year-old twin sons and the Paralympics on the horizon, what's the point in dwelling on that instant he slipped on a wet floor? \\"I've been very fortunate,\\" he said, adding: \\"You've only got a limited amount of time in life. So you may as well choose to put that towards positive effort, rather than squandering it on the negative.\\"","output":"1. Paul Callahan, a quadriplegic, is set to represent the United States in sailing at the Paralympics. 2. His journey began after a freak accident left him paralyzed from the chest down at 21 years old. 3.

Kevin was very good at recalling images.","output":"Randy loved flash card memory games while Kevin hated them because Randy was very good at recalling images. This ability allowed Randy to excel in such games, as they relied on participants being able to remember various patterns, pictures, or words and quickly recognize them when they reappeared. Randy's talent for rapidly remembering images made him an ideal player for this type of activity, especially because this skill enabled him to perform well in both individual and team competitions. On the other hand, Kevin's lack of proficiency in recalling images led him to struggle when playing flash card memory games. Although he could sometimes remember a few of the images, his ability to quickly identify and match them was not as robust as Randy's. As a result, Kevin found the games frustrating, as they highlighted a skill he perceived as a shortcoming. This disparity in abilities only served to emphasize the difference between the two friends, creating a competitive rift that neither found pleasant. Additionally, memory games involving images often require players to practice concentration and focus when taking in new information. Randy's ability to remember images, combined with a keen sense of concentration, ensured he could pinpoint crucial details and recall them later when necessary. Consequently, Randy was able to derive a great sense of satisfaction and accomplishment whenever he excelled in these games. Conversely, Kevin found concentrating on the images in these games challenging, which exacerbated his difficulties in recalling them. At times, his attention would waver, making it even harder for him to identify and match images quickly. Consequently, Kevin felt these games reinforced his difficulties with concentration and memory, causing him to dislike them. Furthermore, while Randy's prowess in flash card memory games helped him build and maintain self-confidence, Kevin's struggles with them had the opposite effect. Unsatisfying experiences with the games left Kevin feeling disheartened and inadequate, especially when he compared his abilities to Randy's. Inherently, people tend to enjoy activities that play to their strengths, and this difference in skills and enjoyment levels created a rift between Randy and Kevin in regard to flash card memory games. Ultimately, Randy loved flash card memory games because he was very good at recalling images, allowing him to excel at these challenges.

Unlucky: Mary Roberts, who survived the sinking. of the Titanic, then endured a second shipwreck just two years later in. the North Sea near Whitby. Its owner survived the sinking of the Titanic and then endured a second shipwreck just two years later. Now the trunk Mary Roberts lost in her latter brush with a watery grave has resurfaced for sale on eBay. Miss Roberts spent a life at sea before finding fame by living through the infamous Titanic disaster in 1912, then surviving the sinking of the Rohilla in 1914. But her trunk had been presumed lost. to the North Sea since tempestuous winds smashed the steamship against. rocks to the west of Saltwick Nab, near Whitby, North Yorkshire. Wednesday. saw the 99th anniversary of the sinking of the Rohilla, where lifeboat. crews battled for 50 hours to pull 144 survivors from the wreck. As. the Rohilla sank Mary Roberts was brought ashore by lifeboat, and was. later quoted as saying the Rohilla sinking was worse to endure than the. Titanic. Miss Roberts had been a stewardess for White Star Line for several years when she signed on for the Titanic’s maiden voyage. When it launched, the RMS Titanic was one of the most opulent liners to have ever been built and the largest steamship in the world. It struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City and sank on April 15, 1912, claiming the lives of 1,517 passengers and crew. The crew of the ship had failed to heed warnings of ice in the North Atlantic and were sailing at speed through an ice field when it struck the huge floe. Those who either drowned or froze to death in the disaster died mainly because there were not enough lifeboats on the ship and those that were used were half-empty. There was no chance of survival in the -2.2C water. Miss Roberts was one of the lucky ones. She left the doomed liner on lifeboat Number 11, helping to look after a small baby until being rescued by the Carpathia. She would later note that the White Star Line stopped her pay at 2.20am, the exact time Titanic sank. Missing for 99 years: Pete Thomson, curator of. Whitby Lifeboat Museum, with Miss Roberts's trunk, which she lost at sea. when the Rohilla was dashed against rocks in heavy gales and. tempestuous seas in 1914. But it was after only a short recovery that she felt the call of the sea again, signing on to the Rohilla as a nurse. A. ship of the British India Steam Navigation company, the steamer had. been commandeered by the government to operate as a hospital ship at the. outbreak of the First World War. It. was carrying more than 200 patients and crew when, amid fierce gales. and wartime black-out conditions at 4.00am on on October 30, it struck. Whitby Rock, a reef at Salwick, south of Whitby town. The. boat was only 660 yards from shore, but the storm force winds. complicated efforts to rescue survivors from the wreck and treacherous. seas. Whitby's life boat. could not make it out of the harbour, and had to be carried by hand. over an eight-foot sea wall and across rocks so it could be launched. from a nearby beach. A painting imagines the scene as the Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean. Miss Roberts left the doomed liner on lifeboat Number 11, helping to look after a small baby until being rescued by the Carpathia. Miss. Roberts, one of only five women aboard the Rohilla, was among the first. 17 survivors rescued by the Whitby lifeboatmen, which went back to. rescue a further 18 before it too was smashed by the storm. But. by then, a further six RNLI lifeboats had arrived and valiantly. continued the rescue operation for a weary, wet two days, eventually. saving most of the 229 people aboard. Eighty-five lives were lost in the disaster. A photograph originally published in Popular Mechanics magazine shows life guards trying to get. line to the Rohilla as it fell to pieces. Miss Roberts was among the first people saved from. the ship by the Whitby lifeboat. Her trunk, an. intriguing relic of maritime history, has now been recovered by the. Whitby Lifeboat Museum, after its curator, Pete Thomson, spotted it on. for sale on eBay. He said:. 'It’s spooky, the fact that I have got this here now, 99 years later. Mary Roberts carried it on to the Rohilla and then she never saw it. again. 'When. the sea calmed down the rocks would be crawling with people picking up. items and it’s been missing for the last 99 years until it surfaced on. eBay for sale a month ago.' Mr Thomson, a former lifeboat coxswain, was not even aware of the antique’s existence until he contacted a friend who had attended the 90th anniversary in 2004 who happened to mention the trunk. Scavenged from the wreck? The box was found in a house clearance in York earlier this year, but its history before that is a mystery. 'If I hadn’t made that phone call I wouldn’t have got it. It was an absolute freak of luck. It’s such a coincidence, it’s almost as if the Lord’s looking out for us,' he said. Mr Thomson contacted the seller, an antiques dealer in Louth, Lincolnshire, who agreed to sell it to the museum for just £50. Made of tin, with wooden struts, the box was found during a house clearance in York earlier this year, but prior to that its history is unknown. The Rohilla was built in 1906 by. Harland and Wolff in Belfast, the same shipyard that would later. construct the equally ill-fated Titanic. Whereas. the Titanic sank in calm water, the weather during the Rohilla disaster. was tempestuous, with gales and huge waves battering against the ship. as it broke apart. Since. purchasing the trunk, Mr Thomson has been in contact with the. descendants of Miss Roberts, who didn’t know of its existence. The. trunk is now set to feature in a national World War One exhibition. focusing on the brave lifeboatmen who rushed to the aid of the stricken. vessels and their beleaguered survivors. Called. Hope in the Great War, the touring exhibition will celebrate the. courage and bravery of the lifeboat crews who risked their lives for. strangers during the First World War. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article tells the story of Mary Roberts, a survivor of both the Titanic sinking in 1912 and the Rohilla shipwreck in 1914. Her trunk, which was lost during the Rohilla wreck, resurfaced for sale on eBay and was eventually acquired by the Whitby Lifeboat Museum. Mary Roberts was a stewardess for the White Star Line and later a nurse on the Rohilla. The Rohilla sank near Whitby, North Yorkshire, and lifeboat crews battled for 50 hours to save 144 survivors. The trunk has now become an intriguing relic of maritime history, set to feature in a national World War One exhibition, focusing on brave lifeboatmen who rescued survivors of stricken vessels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a classic tale of a brilliant scientist who makes a wonderful discovery, and then loses his mind.The book was long in the build up, and did meander a bit. I liked it when the Invisible Man decided that he wanted to create a reign of terror. I would, personally, have loved a little more exploration of the subject at this point. The evil genius, the evil joker, are all subjects that have fascinated me for years.HGW was such a great writer, he would have been brilliant had he delved deeper into the mind of the scientist.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Orphaned Leela (Meena Kumari) lives with her cruel aunt, Rangilibai (Leela Mishra); cousin, Kaushalya (Kammo); and uncle Vikram Singh (Badri Prasad). When Rangilibai arranges Kaushalya's marriage to Chhote Thakur (M. Rajan), the son of a wealthy landlord, Leela agrees to go with her as a maid as part of her dowry. But things change when the landlord rejects Kaushalya and decides to marry Leela. After marriage, Leela is accused of having a lover and is thrown out of home by her husband, who later understands his mistake as he was misled by his sister. Leela goes to Rangilibai's house, but she firmly refuses to accept her. Alone and desperate, Leela meets a distant relative named Gaman Singh (Kanhaiyalal). He takes her in to live with him and his wife, Swarupbai (Kuldip Kaur). When Leela refuses Swarupbai's demand to beg for alms, the latter blinds her with special eye-drops. Having lost her vision, a blinded Leela is led daily through the streets and is forced to sit near the steps of a temple singing and begging for alms. Soon Leela develops a loving mother-son relationship with another begger of Swarupbai, a boy named Panna (Daisy Irani). This relationship carries the narrative forward. Answer:","output":"Question: In the movie plot, how does Leela navigate through adversity and develop a meaningful relationship with young Panna, eventually transforming their lives?  The story revolves around the life of orphaned Leela, who endures various hardships and tragic events in her life. Despite the adversity she faces, her resilience and kindness ultimately lead her to form a strong bond with a young beggar boy, Panna. This relationship is crucial both for their individual growth and for the progression of the storyline.  Initially, Leela goes through a series of unfortunate events in her life, beginning with living under the tyranny of her cruel aunt Rangilibai and eventually being falsely accused of infidelity by her husband. After being thrown out by her husband and rejected by her aunt, Leela finds temporary solace with distant relative Gaman Singh and his wife Swarupbai. However, her hardships are far from over as Swarupbai maliciously blinds Leela for refusing to beg for alms. Now forced into a life of begging, Leela is guided through the streets each day by young Panna, who is also under Swarupbai's control. Panna and Leela's relationship starts out as one of necessity but soon blossoms into a genuine bond built on love, trust, and mutual support. Their connection adds a new dimension to the plot, providing a ray of hope amidst the darkness and despair. The loving mother-son relationship between Leela and Panna serves as a catalyst for positive change in their lives. Leela's maternal instincts towards Panna give her a renewed sense of purpose and strength, even in her most vulnerable state. In turn, Panna becomes fiercely protective of Leela, and their relationship transcends their individual suffering. As the story develops, Leela and Panna's relationship continues to drive the narrative forward, showcasing the incredible power of love and resilience in overcoming adversity. Through teamwork, they may eventually find a way to break free from their unfortunate circumstances and secure a better future together. In conclusion, the movie plot centers on Leela's journey through various challenges, as well as the loving relationship she forms with Panna. This bond not only impacts both of their lives but also propels the story forward in a meaningful way. Leela's enduring strength and compassionate nature, despite her hardships, truly exemplify the transformative power of love and resilience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Aimee Toms’ has a pixie haircut because she recently, for the third time, donated her hair to a charity that makes wigs for child cancer patients. Photo: / Woman mistaken for transgender harassed in Walmart bathroom 1 / 3 Back to Gallery      DANBURY - Aimee Toms was washing her hands in the women’s bathroom at Walmart in Danbury Friday when a stranger approached her and said, “You’re disgusting!” and “You don’t belong here!”      After momentary confusion, she realized that the woman next to her thought - because of her pixie-style haircut and baseball cap - that she was transgender.      Toms believes the incident happened because of the national controversy sparked by a law that was passed in North Carolina attempting to force transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they were identified as at birth. Since then, religious conservatives have launched a boycott of Walmart competitor Target, which has said transgender people are welcome to use its bathrooms freely. Nationally, Walmart has been silent on the issue.      Toms, a 22-year-old from Naugatuck who works at a retail store in the Bethel-Danbury retail area around Walmart, posted a video “rant” about her experience on Facebook Friday that had been viewed more than 12,000 times by Sunday evening.      “After experiencing the discrimination they face firsthand, I cannot fathom the discrimination transgender people must face in a lifetime,” she said. “Can you imagine going out every day and having people tell you you should not be who you are or that people will not accept you as who you are?”      Warning: Video contains graphic language that some viewers may find offensive.      Toms said on Sunday that she isn’t embarrassed talking about someone mistaking her for male, just upset that the North Carolina law has emboldened people like the woman she encountered.      “I think this is all just a response. No one was telling these people to be scared of transgender people before. No one was telling them that they should be throwing people out of bathrooms,” Toms said. “As if it wasn’t scary enough for transgender people to use the bathroom before.”      Besides being a pretty normal choice of style for women, Toms’ has a short haircut because she recently donated hair - for the third time - to a program that makes wigs for child cancer patients.      “I’ve had people call me all sorts of names for having short hair. I’ve had people call me a boy, I’ve had people call me a dyke, I’ve had people call me gay.” Toms said. “I’m grateful that that woman only called me disgusting and didn’t physically attack me … I was a victim of transphobia today as a cisgender female because my hair is short.”      Toms said she was supportive of transgender rights before Friday’s Walmart experience. She is close friends with several transgender people, including someone she went to high school with who went from prom queen to identifying as a male.      She thought her video would be seen only by friends and family, and was surprised to soon be getting messages of support from people “all across the country.”      Toms’ video has gone viral in part because of her blunt retelling of the incident and articulate plea for better treatment of transgender people.      “I saw it, and it happened, and i thought to myself, ‘this is unbelievable.’ She said, ‘you are not supposed to be here. You need to leave.’ She flipped me off. She said, ‘you’re disgusting,’ and she storms out,” Toms explains in the video. “She thought I was someone who was transgender. She thought I was a dude who was hiding in the women’s bathroom.”      Toms explains that she was wearing a baseball cap at the time, and she models it on the video. (“I look adorable in a baseball cap!”)      “I get it. The short hair. The baseball cap. I was wearing a plain blue T-shirt. She saw me from the back,” Toms said. But “... at the sake of sounding blunt, I’m not a flat-chested person. I have got something going on up here.”      Jill Marie Hackett, of Bethel, a friend of Toms’, said she did “a very good job with articulating with how she feels about discrimination toward (transgender) people and how this whole madness regarding public restrooms is already turning hostile toward the very women it ‘seeks to protect.’”      Hackett said she was troubled that it happened in her hometown.      Toms said it was just an example of “how amazingly ridiculous how this is becoming as an issue.”      She cited an incident in Texas recently in which a man followed a woman into the woman’s bathroom because he thought she looked like a man and he wanted to protect the women. Like Toms, he had seen a cisgender woman with short hair wearing casual, not particularly girly clothing.      She said what happened to her just reinforces how difficult it is to make judgments about a person, and how pointless considering the “complete” lack of documented incidents of transgender people lurking in bathrooms and assaulting people. In fact, Toms said, transgender people are far more likely to be victims of an assault in a bathroom.      “You’ve probably used the bathroom with someone who’s transgender before,” she said. “These people literally affect their life in no way, shape or form.”      Toms said that she didn’t speak to the Danbury Walmart’s management about the issue, because she lost track of where the woman went after the incident and figured all they’d be able to do is to ask her to be better-mannered. There were no other witnesses to the incident.      Since passage of the North Carolina bathroom law, the Obama administration has threatened to withhold some federal funds from the state, and has issued a separate decree requiring public schools across the country to respect transgender people’s right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. It’s been met with pushback in some parts of the country, but not Connecticut, which has had a law on the books for several years that protects transgender rights.      “People hate what they don’t understand and they hate what they don’t know,” Toms said. “And it creates a cycle of disgusting bigotry that reflects back on our nation and makes us look ridiculous.” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Given the question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\", is \\"quit on the spot\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"To determine if \\"quit on the spot\\" is a valid answer for what Alex would want to do next, we need to consider the context, Alex's motivation and his experiences.  Step 1: Analyze the context The sentence indicates that Quinn requires Alex's effort to complete the mission. So, the context seems to be a situation where Alex's expertise is essential for the mission's success.  Step 2: Consider Alex's motivation As the most experienced person for the job, Alex may be confident in their abilities or may feel a sense of responsibility to complete the mission. This could make Alex motivated to stay and help. Step 3: Analyze Alex's experiences It is mentioned that Alex is the most experienced person for the job. This implies that he has faced similar challenges and situations before. If Alex is well-versed in handling such circumstances, it's possible that Alex could feel motivated to perform his assigned responsibilities. Based on these steps, it seems unlikely that \\"quit on the spot\\" would be a valid answer for what Alex wants to do next.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In the fictional town of Gatlin, Nebraska, Job, a small child who is a resident of the town, tells the story of how the town became a haven for a group of young cultists. The economy of the town is mostly agricultural, and the town is surrounded by vast cornfields. One particular year the corn crop fails and the people of Gatlin turn to prayer in an attempt to ensure a successful harvest. A 12-year-old young boy, Isaac Chroner, takes all the children of Gatlin into a cornfield and preaches to them about the prophecies of a strange, bloodthirsty incarnation of the Abrahamic God called \\"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\\". Isaac, through his 17-year-old lieutenant Malachai, leads the children in a revolution, brutally killing all of the adults in the town. Over the ensuing years, the children take any adults passing through as sacrifices. Three years later, Vicky and her boyfriend Burt pass through Nebraska while driving cross-country to Burt's new job as a physician in Seattle, Washington. As they travel in their car they hit a small boy out on the highway, one of the Gatlin children who tried to escape the iron hand of the syncretistic death cult. After inspection of the boy's body Burt determines that the child had his throat slit before being hit by the car and had stumbled on to the road from inside the cornfield.

You want to make a tasty bistro bacon vinaigrette. Let's make it easy for you to understand, like a story for a 5-year-old.  Here's the best way to make bistro bacon vinaigrette: 1. Gather your ingredients: We need 4 slices of bacon, 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon of honey, 1/2 cup of olive oil, salt, and pepper. 2. Cook the bacon: Ask an adult for help. Place the bacon in a pan over medium heat, and cook until it's crispy. While the bacon cooks, it will make some bacon grease. So, keep that bacon grease safe in a container. After the bacon is cooked, let it cool down and then break it into little pieces. 3. Mix the other ingredients: In a bowl, we will mix the red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, salt, and pepper.  4. Add the olive oil: Slowly pour the olive oil into the bowl while mixing. This will make our dressing nice and smooth. 5. Add bacon and bacon grease: Finally, add the bacon pieces and 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease into the bowl.

Write some highlights for the following article: They say lightning doesn't strike twice but among some gullible Chelsea fans that phrase doesn't appear to apply. A year ago talkSPORT, managed to dupe some Blues supporters into believing that their club was linked with various players during the January transfer window - only for those names to be made up.And 12 months on, the radio station has been at it again outside Stamford Bridge - with the theme being of Star Wars characters this time around dubbed as 'Transfer Wars'. VIDEO Scroll down to see Chelsea fans fooled in Star Wars transfer target prank. Chelsea fans were duped into believing that players based on Star Wars characters were transfer targets. TalkSPORT dubbed the video 'Transfer Wars' in relation to the sci-fi franchise theme. Keen to prove their unrelenting passion for the club though, fans claim to have seen 'trio' JJ Binks (Jar Jar Binks), Artur Detur (R2-D2) and Stew Bacca (Chewbacca) - with all three reported welcome additions to Jose Mourinho's squad. Binks, a centre back or a left winger from the MLS, is described by one fan as the 'new John Terry,' while another says he will be a good signing on the flanks. Bacca is mentioned to play in the similar mould of his older 'brother' Carlos - the Sevilla and Colombia international striker. Unlike his 28-year-old 'sibling' though, Bacca's main 'attributes' are his ability to play as a target man. The 6ft 5in forward would be a welcome addition according to the Blues faithful and is seen as an ideal replacement for club legend Didier Drogba. 'Stew Bacca' was seen by fans as an ideal replacement for club legend Didier Drogba. 'Artur Detur' like JJ Binks is another young prospect who can play both as a centre back or as a left winger. Detur, like Binks, has the rare tactical flexibility to play in the heart of defence and or on the left flank - a trait that Chelsea supporters clearly feel would be a bonus commodity. The France star's potential arrival is one relished by the west London faithful, although one fan believes he needs another season before he can make a real impact at the club. Although the force is not with all Chelsea supporters, two were switched on to the prank. Upon hearing of Binks a male duo state that they have 'never heard of him,' before querying that the MLS prospect 'sounds like something out of Star Wars.' The duo's suspicions are confirmed upon hearing Detur's name but alas if only their fellow supporters were as clued up. The prank didn't fool these two Chelsea fans (centre and right) though who were wise to the made-up names. Luckily for them though there's no pulling the wool the eyes over Mourinho's side at present it seems, as the Blues continue to fight on all four fronts for silverware this season. Saturday's 2-0 win at home to Newcastle saw the Blues move two points clear of title rivals Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. Chelsea travel to Swansea next on Saturday evening looking for their 16th win in 22 league games. Oscar (centre) scored Chelsea's opener as they beat Newcastle 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday.","output":"1.

What a disappointment!  I will start with the positive - we were seated within 5 min, despite the busy time for them. Our server was very kind.  Now, the not-so-positive.... We were given a menu with a menu within. I wondered why 2, as it seemed the smaller menu had similar items, except for they were priced in half. Then I realized the smaller menu was their lunch menu and since it was 12:30 pm, I set the bigger (dinner) menu aside.  It seemed like it took a really long time for our food to arrive, but again, they were pretty busy so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. The problem is that it is hard not to fill up on salad and bread sticks. I found Iceberg lettuce to be a rather cheap choice.  My meal was ok but nothing impressive. Such was the opinion of the other 3 people at the table.   One of my daughters ordered chicken Alfredo (or so I thought) but got Alfredo noodles with no chicken. I thought perhaps she did not speak clearly enough when she ordered and since she had already filled up on breadsticks and salad, I decided to not say anything.  The really sad part began after we got the bill. I usually don't pay attention to the details on my restaurant bills and I don't know what prompted me to do it this time. First thing I noticed was a charge of 2.50 for chicken with the kid's Alfredo noodles. I told our server that the meal actually did not have chicken. After apologizing, he said he will have his manager remove the extra charge as well as remove the 2 sundae charges for us as a courtesy. I thought that was very nice of him.   A few minutes later, he came back embarrassed, to say that his manager removed the chicken charge but not the desserts. I did not find this to be a problem since my kids consumed the desserts anyway.   After he brought the credit card slip to sign, I took a closer look at the bill and realized both adult meals were at twice the listed price. Then I remembered the 2 menus.   On our way out, I asked the hostess what the difference between the two menus was and after she told me the smaller menu was for lunch, I asked what was needed to order lunch items next time. She replied: \\"We serve lunch until 4pm\\". Then I looked at the clock (close to 2 pm) and asked why we were charged dinner prices. Her reply was: \\"let me get my manager\\".  More than 5 min later, when no one came, I asked her if I should continue to wait. She said: \\"let me check\\" and ran back inside. After a few more minutes the manager came. I shook his hand and introduced myself. His reply was: \\"Hi, how can I help you\\"? I had to ask him for his name. After he introduced himself, I shared with him my confusion about their \\"lunch and dinner menus/prices\\" and that since we had come in at noon, we thought we were getting the lunch option but were charged for dinner\\". He replied that on weekends, they \\"expect people to eat more\\"(?!?!?!), therefore, hand out dinner menus (not true!). He also stated that lunch can be ordered at any time of the day, \\"even at 10 pm\\" (which contradicted the waitress), but you had to specifically tell yours server you wanted the lunch item. Then, before I even had the chance to respond, he said: \\"Hold on, I'll be back\\". He ran in the back and after some time came back and handed me a gift card, saying: \\"Sorry about the confusion, this should help with your next visit\\".  I thanked him and walked out where my boyfriend and kids who were getting pretty impatient, as they had been waiting for more than 10 min.  Once we got in the car and I looked at the gift card, I just about screamed - a 5 gift card.  I found that to be extremely insulting and pathetic and promised NEVER to go back there again!

Is To raise funds for its construction, Northwestern sold 100 \\"perpetual scholarships\\" entitling the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the statement you provided is a relatively good answer to the question. However, it can be expanded upon to give a more detailed and long answer. Here it is: To raise funds for the construction of its first building, Northwestern University employed an innovative approach by selling \\"perpetual scholarships\\" for 100 each. These perpetual scholarships were a unique method of generating income for the university since they would entitle the purchaser and their direct descendants to free tuition at the institution. The idea was essentially an early form of crowdfunding, where a significant number of individuals contributed funds to support the establishment of the university. The concept of perpetual scholarships not only helped Northwestern raise necessary funds for constructing its initial facilities but also forged a strong connection between the investors and the university. It created a sense of loyalty and investment in the institution's future, as the purchasers were essentially buying into the idea of long-term academic success for themselves and their families. As a result, their interests were aligned with the growth and development of the university.  Although offering perpetual scholarships may seem unusual from today's perspective, this strategy proved effective in raising funds for the construction of Northwestern's first building, which was named Old College. The sales of these scholarships enabled the university to move forward with its plans to establish a campus in Evanston, Illinois. Eventually, the construction of Old College was completed in 1855, with the building serving as the main academic facility for students.  Over the years, the number of perpetual scholarships at Northwestern decreased due to various reasons, such as changes in the university's financial structure, rising costs of tuition, and advancements in financial aid. However, the concept did fulfill its intended purpose of raising funds for the university's first building and played a crucial role in the foundation of Northwestern University as we know it today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: What produces microspores that develop into pollen grains containing male gametophytes?   A: A:","output":"Angiosperms, specifically the anthers within the flowers of angiosperms, produce microspores that develop into pollen grains containing male gametophytes. Angiosperms, also known as flowering plants, are the most diverse and widespread group of plants on Earth, with over 300,000 species identified. They are characterized by their reproductive structures, which generate flowers that facilitate the reproductive process. The male reproductive organs in angiosperms are the stamens, each consisting of a filament and an anther. The anther is the specialized structure responsible for generating microspores. During the reproductive process, anthers undergo a specific type of cell division called meiosis within the microsporangia, leading to the production of microspore mother cells. The microspore mother cells are diploid cells, meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes. These cells undergo meiosis to produce four haploid microspores, each carrying half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. As these microspores divide mitotically, they form the structures and cells that make up the male gametophytes. The mature male gametophyte, also known as a pollen grain, ultimately consists of a minimal number of cells. It consists of a vegetative cell with a large nucleus and a generative cell that forms two sperm cells. This structure is protected by a specialized outer layer known as the pollen wall, which allows it to be transported efficiently by various agents, such as wind, water, or animal vectors. This transfer process, called pollination, is a critical step in the reproductive process of angiosperms, ultimately facilitating fertilization and the development of a new plant. When a pollen grain lands on a receptive stigma, which is part of the female reproductive organ called the pistil, it germinates, and the pollen tube starts to grow. As the pollen tube grows down the style and reaches the ovary containing ovules, the sperm cells are released. One sperm cell fuses with the egg's nucleus to form a zygote, which eventually develops into an embryo, while the other sperm cell fuses with two polar nuclei to form the triploid endosperm, providing the developing seed with nutrients. In summary, it is the anthers within the flowers of angiosperms that produce microspores that develop into pollen grains containing male gametophytes. These male gametophytes play a vital role in the reproductive process of flowering plants, fertilizing the female gametes found within the ovules and eventually giving rise to seeds that develop into new plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.  Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - The American Society of Church History (ASCH) was founded in 1888 with the disciplines of Christian denominational and ecclesiastical history as its focus. Today the society's interests include the broad range of the critical scholarly perspectives, as applied to the history of Christianity and its relationship to surrounding cultures in all periods, locations and contexts. The society was founded by the classic church historian Philip Schaff.   - The University of California, Riverside (UCR or UC Riverside), is a public research university and one of the 10 general campuses of the University of California system.

Founded in 1907 as the UC Citrus Experiment Station, Riverside pioneered research in biological pest control and the use of growth regulators responsible for extending the citrus growing season in California from four to nine months. Some of the world's most important research collections on citrus diversity and entomology, as well as science fiction and photography, are located at Riverside.  - Brown University is a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, founded in 1764 as \\"The College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\\" Brown is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges established before the American Revolution.  - The history of Christianity concerns the Christian religion, Christendom, and the Church with its various denominations, from the 1st century to the present.  - Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York.  - Edwin Scott Gaustad ( November 14 , 1923 -- March 25 , 2011 ) was a Professor of History at the University of California , Riverside . He achieved fame with his study of the genealogy of religion in the United States , Historical atlas of religion in America . The 1972 edition of this work has been used in secular histories of Mainline Protestantism and the Emergent church movement ( denominationalism ) for decades . A graduate of Baylor University and Brown University , Gaustad dedicated his career to sharing his expansive research on religious history . Gaustad was President of the American Society of Church History . Gaustad died March 25 , 2011 in Santa Fe , New Mexico at the age of 87 .  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.

Czech:","output":"To translate the phrase \\"They are soft\\" to Czech, I will take the following steps: 1. Identify the subject pronoun: \\"They\\" in English refers to a third person plural pronoun. In Czech, the equivalent is \\"Oni\\" for masculine animate, \\"Ony\\" for feminine and masculine inanimate, and \\"Ona\\" for neuter subjects. 2. Identify the verb \\"to be\\": In English, \\"are\\" is the conjugated form of the verb \\"to be\\" for the pronoun \\"they.\\" In Czech, the verb \\"to be\\" is \\"být,\\" and the conjugated form for \\"oni,\\" \\"ony,\\" and \\"ona\\" is \\"jsou.\\" 3.

Arrange the words in the correct Czech sentence structure: In Czech, the typical sentence structure is subject-verb-object (SVO) like in English. However, the adjective usually comes after the noun.

Please answer the following question: Skylar was poor as they had just spent 1000 dollars getting their car fixed so Sasha suggested treating Skylar to a shopping spree to cheer them up.  Given the context: What will happen to Sasha?  Possible answers: be criticized, be grateful to Sasha, be thanked Answer:","output":"In this context, Sasha will most likely be thanked by Skylar after offering to treat them to a shopping spree to cheer them up. The reason for this is that Skylar, being in a financially difficult situation after spending a considerable amount of money on car repairs, would appreciate the kind and thoughtful gesture from their friend Sasha. Sasha's offer of a shopping spree demonstrates empathy and an understanding of Skylar's situation, which will foster feelings of gratitude in Skylar. This shopping spree would provide both a much-needed respite from the recent financial stress for Skylar and an opportunity for them to enjoy themselves. Aside from being thanked, Sasha's actions could also strengthen their friendship with Skylar. By showing care and support during challenging times, Sasha is extending a hand of friendship and reinforcing their commitment to one another. This kind of support can go a long way in deepening relationships and building trust between friends. However, it is important to note that being criticized is not a likely outcome in this scenario, as Sasha's intentions are good-natured and their gesture is meant to alleviate Skylar's stress. Also, since Sasha is voluntarily offering to treat Skylar to a shopping spree, it is unlikely for Skylar to criticize her actions. In summary, given the context, Sasha will likely be thanked by Skylar for their thoughtful and generous gesture of offering a shopping spree to help cheer them up after their financial setback due to car repairs.

Here is an article: Dawn Hudson was working in her home office in Bronxville, N.Y., last August when her cell phone rang and up popped the name of a man she hadn’t heard from in five years: Roger Goodell. Not one for small talk, the NFL Commissioner surprised Hudson with a big-league offer: to be the NFL’s new chief marketing officer. At first discounting herself as a candidate, she told Goodell she’d help him find someone else for the job. “That night I couldn’t stop thinking about it,” she recalls. “I did a 180.” You have to give Hudson, a former PepsiCo PEP executive who earned her stripes fighting the cola wars, credit for stepping right in it—the NFL’s controversies around domestic violence, brain injuries on the field, and the latest: Deflategate, involving charges that the league’s most marketable quarterback, Tom Brady, and his coach were involved in the intentional deflating of footballs. “My philosophy is that you can learn the most and contribute the most when there’s a crisis,” says Hudson, who started as CMO in mid-October and oversees not only the NFL’s marketing but also its events, including Super Bowl XLIX this Sunday. “It’s easier to drive change when things are in flux than when things are going well.” Hudson, 57, spent 11 years at PepsiCo and got to know Goodell before he became Commissioner, back in 2002 when Pepsi replaced Coke as the NFL’s official soft-drink sponsor. In 2006, when Indra Nooyi was appointed PepsiCo’s CEO, Hudson was president and CEO of Pepsi-Cola North America. The following year, Nooyi restructured senior management and squeezed Hudson out of her job. The ouster hurt at the time, but Hudson now takes it in stride. “She did me a favor,” she says about her former boss, explaining that Nooyi “allowed me to grow again. I should have left Pepsi two years earlier because the (soft drink) business had gone into decline.” With two daughters, who are now 24 and 17, Hudson went on to join Boston-based strategic advisory firm Parthenon Group, where she had a nice setup: She worked from home a couple of days a week, enjoyed flexible hours and had a vice chairman title. She had built and was in charge of Parthenon’s consumer practice when the firm’s owners decided to sell to EY (formerly Ernst & Young). Hudson was excited to move into a full-time senior role at EY, but then, she couldn’t resist the Commissioner’s call. “I love sports,” she says. A serious athlete since her college days at Dartmouth, she plays competitive tennis, paddle tennis and golf. A few years ago, she served as chairman of the LPGA, though she admits that when she watches golf or baseball on TV, “I nap.” What’s her favorite sport? “Honestly, it’s football,” she says, while declining to name her favorite team. She grew up a New England Patriots fan in Boston, rooted for the Bears when she headed ad agency DMB&B in Chicago. Her husband, Bruce, is a New York Giants fan. As a brand-builder, she’s excited about the NFL because “there’s a passion around sports that connects to people more fervently than consumer packaged-goods brands do,” she says. The Ray Rice imbroglio and other controversies have not deflated viewership. NFL games accounted for all of the top 20 and 45 of the 50 most-watched TV shows last fall, according to Nielsen. Meanwhile, a Harris poll of 2, 255 U.S. adults in December found that pro football is still America’s favorite sport for 32% of sports fans—though down from 35% a year earlier. (Baseball comes in second, at 16%, up from 14%.) Rebuilding the NFL’s image is Hudson’s priority. The league has devoted commercial time during Sunday’s Super Bowl to broadcast a spot from an anti-domestic violence group called No More. Meanwhile, she says, the right thing to do is, um, keep your eye on the ball: the game of football. “We have to keep ourselves fan-centric,” she says. So, the NFL’s own 60-second Super Bowl spot, which she worked on with Grey Advertising, is a crowd-pleasing celebration of the game, showing hundreds of fans from all corners (including unexpected fans like Internet sensation Keyboard Cat and the characters from The Lego Movie and Penguins of Madagascar) excited for the fourth quarter. Hudson also has been working with her old friends at Pepsi, which is sponsoring the halftime show starring Katy Perry. Her career philosophy is what brought her to this job. “I’ve always believed you should go with your gut,” she says. She advises that you recognize “the emotional reaction, and then go rational. Think about what does the new opportunity present in terms of career development, challenge and lifestyle? Also, since everyone is so busy and stretched these days, “you have to be your own mentor,” she says. “Be self-aware: know your strengths and weaknesses.” Most importantly, Hudson adds, “Learn at all ages, because you never want to get stale.” Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Dawn Hudson: From PepsiCo Executive to NFL's Chief Marketing Officer Amidst Controversies and Challenges\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What was the name of the chapel that was dismantled in 1571? is inside the article: A middle Saxon pendant dating from 601–700 AD was discovered in a field in Little Thetford in 1952. This 3-centimetre (1.18 in) diameter by 1-centimetre (0.39 in) thick pendant, made from rock-crystal, gold, garnet, and amethyst coloured-glass, has been worked in a lathe. The workmanship is not of a high standard. Æthelberht of Kent was said to have built a church at Cratendune around 600 AD, about a mile from what is now Ely Cathedral. In 673 AD, Æthelthryth considered restoring this church, thought to have been destroyed by Penda of Mercia, but instead made what is now Ely Cathedral the site of her monastery. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery, used at some point between 410–1065 AD, was uncovered around 1945 near Little Thetford (52.376N, 0.2375E), and was thought to be this lost village of Cratendune. A deserted Saxon settlement, 410–1065 AD, examined in 1999 in Ely, may also be a candidate for this lost site of worship. Little Thetford means little public or people's ford—Old English lȳtel Thiutforda (c. 972) and Liteltedford [sic] (1086)—compare with Thetford, Norfolk—Old English Thēodford (late 9th century) and Tedfort (1086). The online Domesday Book records the settlement under the name Liteltetford [sic]. The first written evidence that Ely Abbey had inherited the Little Thetford lands was in the 12th-century chronicle, Liber Eliensis. The will of Ælfwaru (d. 1007), an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, granted estates in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to the Abbey, which included \\"... that land at Thetford and fisheries around those marshes\\". In 1110, Hervey le Breton, Bishop of Ely, granted the manor to William Brito, his Archdeacon and also his nephew. Chapel Hill in the village, near the river, commemorates the site of Harrimere Chapel, used since 1381. Some of the stone from this chapel, dismantled in 1571, was used in the building of St George's Church. By 1539, the Little Thetford manor and its estates contained arable land, pasture, gardens, and orchards.  In the mid-16th century, the antiquary William Bowyer..., can you guess it ?","output":"Yes, I can find the answer in the given text.

Please answer the following question: Process: - An airline reservation is made - The passenger arrives early at the airport - The luggage is checked - The passenger waits in line - The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass - The passenger goes to their gate - The passenger gets in line when it's time to board - The person boards the plane - The plane arrives at the destination - The passenger gets off the plane at their destination.  Question: suppose more organic material lies on the floor happens, how will it affect LESS passengers being transported.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"C: No Effect The presence of more organic material on the floor of the airport will not directly impact the number of passengers being transported by an airline. The steps involved in the air travel process remain unchanged, and the increased amount of organic material does not influence the passenger flow, from reservation to arrival at their destination. The specific steps in the air travel process are as follows: 1. An airline reservation is made. 2. The passenger arrives early at the airport. 3. The luggage is checked. 4. The passenger waits in line. 5. The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass. 6. The passenger goes to their gate. 7. The passenger gets in line when it's time to board. 8. The person boards the plane. 9. The plane arrives at the destination. 10. The passenger gets off the plane at their destination. While additional organic material on the floor may be indicative of an unclean environment or might require maintenance, the number of passengers being transported relies primarily on demand for air travel, the airline's capacity to accommodate passengers, and any applicable operational restrictions or regulations. For instance, if the airport and airline’s capacity to handle passengers is unaffected, then the number of travelers being transported remains the same. Demand for air travel typically depends on factors such as pricing, convenience, connectivity, customer service, and promotional campaigns rather than the cleanliness of the airport facility. On the other hand, the presence of more organic material on the floor may cause passengers to question the airport's sanitation standards. However, this would not inherently have an immediate effect on passenger numbers, as individuals may still opt to use the same airline even if they have concerns about the cleanliness of a specific airport. In conclusion, while increased organic material on the floor might influence passengers' experiences and perceptions of the airport cleanliness, it does not directly affect the number of passengers being transported through the processes associated with air travel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This is one of the many reasons why the qinna of one school may differ from that of another.[2] All martial arts contain qinna techniques in some degree. The southern Chinese martial arts have more developed qinna techniques than northern Chinese martial systems. The southern martial arts have much more prevalent reliance on hand techniques which causes the practitioner to be in closer range to their opponent. There are over 700 qinna traditional techniques found in all martial arts. In the Non-Temple White Crane style there are 150-200 qinna techniques alone. Along with Fujian White Crane, styles such as Northern Eagle Claw (Ying Jow Pai) and Tiger Claw (Fu Jow Pai) have qinna as their martial focus and tend to rely on these advanced techniques.  and the situation: There is a long history of martial arts competition in Fujian Province of China.

If you believe that the insurance company undervalued your car in their report, gather and copy any records you have that show that your car was valuable and well-maintained. This includes receipts and other proof of:  Optional features Upgrades, add-ons, and customizations Repairs Regular maintenance Any documents you received from the car's previous owner Spend some time finding evidence that your insurer undervalued your vehicle or overvalued the cost of repair. Kelley Blue Book is a good place to start. KBB is the go-to authority on car values, and lets you calculate the value of your vehicle with reference to its condition and your geographic location. You can also find for-sale listings online or in a newspaper for the make and model in a similar condition in your area. Finally, you may be able to get a quote for repairs from a mechanic. Have him or her put the quote in writing. Vehicle owners are often surprised to find out that their car has depreciated substantially since they purchased it. Remember that the value of your car is based on its resale value, not on what you paid for it. Your insurance adjuster should have prepared the initial report by calculating the average values and cost of repairs for similar vehicles in your area. Submit a detailed collection of evidence showing that the adjuster's valuations were inaccurate. The adjuster will review your supporting documentation. Do your own calculations by averaging the values of several different comparable vehicles in your area. The adjuster will certainly check your math, but your evidence will be more persuasive if you present the conclusion of your research up front. Your insurance company may or may not have had the vehicle appraised in person. Re-read your insurance policy, or ask if your policy guarantees you the right to an independent appraisal. The insurance company will either hire an appraiser inspect your vehicle, or they may simply offer you more money to settle the claim and avoid the trouble of hiring an appraiser. The adjuster may also want to avoid the possibility that the new appraisal will be substantially higher than the initial valuation. Your insurance company has a lot of power in declaring a vehicle a total loss, because they have the money that you need to either repair your car or buy a new one. However, if you can afford to wait, you can exercise some power of your own by refusing to settle right away. Insurance adjusters are typically under a lot of pressure to settle cases quickly. Some sources report that adjusters usually have discretion to increase a settlement amount by up to 500 during negotiations. To get more, you will need to present compelling evidence that their initial calculations were off and demonstrate that you are not in a hurry to settle. Insurance companies are required by law to settle claims in good faith. If you believe that your insurer has acted in bad faith by making an unreasonably low offer, you can file a complaint with your state's Department of Insurance. You can find a directory of links to each Department of Insurance's consumer complaint website here. You can usually submit your complaint online through an electronic form by providing your contact information and the details of your complaint. The Department will investigate your claim for potential regulatory issues and violations of law, and may mediate the issue for you.","output":"To challenge an insurance company's undervalued car assessment, gather supporting documents of the car's value, research comparable vehicles, and consider filing a complaint with the Department of Insurance if the insurer is unreasonably low in their offer."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Finn complies, and the convict unexpectedly tries to make Finn take him by boat to Mexico. The police seize the small boat heading out to sea. The convict hides on a buoy, and Finn's boat is towed back to shore. The next day, Finn sees on the news that the convict, mobster Arthur Lustig, had escaped from death row, but was recaptured and would face execution soon. Finn's uncle Joe Gargery is called to Paradiso Perduto (\\"lost paradise\\"), home of the richest woman in Florida, Mrs. Nora Dinsmoor. She is a local mystery, having shunned virtually all human contact since she was left at the altar several years before. She ostensibly asks him there to do a gardening job, but instead she slips him a large sum of money under the door, calling it \\"gas money\\". Meanwhile, Finn, who he brought along, meets Mrs. Dinsmoor's young niece Estella in the overgrown garden. Mrs. Dinsmoor sees them interacting and calls Maggie (Kim Dickens), Finn's sister, to ask her to let Finn be a playmate for Estella, even though Estella apparently dislikes him. On Finn's first visit, she is disappointed when the boy cannot dance for her, but is intrigued when he says he can draw. She forces Estella to sit for a portrait, which Finn draws with make up on an old piece of wallpaper. While he draws, Mrs. Dinsmoor warns Finn that he will fall in love with Estella and have his heart broken. After the portrait session, Mrs. Dinsmoor calls it a day and asks Estella to help Finn find the door. On the way out, she pauses to take a drink from a water fountain and politely offers him a drink from it as well. While Finn is drinking, Estella kisses him. Several years pass.

He is just one of those passengers that you can't please no matter what. Is he fussy?

Their mineral water was poured from a bottle wrapped in a white napkin; our mineral water - the same brand (how did he know if theirs was wrapped?) -- was poured without the napkin.\\" Holy cow!

He berates the passengers and ships for causing pollution, yet he himself has taken (and presumably will try to take) multiple cruises.

Today, we're going to learn about becoming an all-around entertainer who can dance, sing, rap, and write music. Can you imagine yourself becoming this amazing singer-dancer like your favorite pop stars? It's fun, right? So let's learn how we can do that! First, let's talk about dancing. Dancing is a fun way to move and groove with the music. If you want to become a better dancer, you should try going to dance classes. In dance classes, you'll learn fun dance moves and routines, and meet new friends who also love dancing. As you practice more and more, you'll become a better and more versatile dancer. A versatile dancer is someone who can do lots of different dance styles, like ballet or hip-hop or even tap dancing! Now, let's learn about singing. Singing is using your voice to make beautiful melodies and harmonies. To become a good singer, you might want to invest in a vocal coach. A vocal coach is a friendly teacher who helps you learn how to sing better by teaching you techniques to improve your voice and reach higher or lower notes. With their guidance, your voice will become stronger and more pleasant to listen to. Next, we're going to talk about rapping. Rapping is like talking to the beat of the music really fast and with a sense of rhythm. Are you ready to rap? Well, you can! To become better at rapping, it's important to practice. You can listen to rap songs and try to sing along or practice on your own by making up fun rhymes and beats. The more you practice, the better at rapping you will become. Last but not least, let's learn about writing music. Writing music means creating your own songs by coming up with lyrics, which are the words we sing, and a melody, which is the tune of the song. To become good at writing music, practice writing your own songs and also try to learn and perfect well-known songs. This way, you'll understand what makes a song catchy and fun, and you can use that knowledge to create your own amazing music. In conclusion, little friends, if you want to become an all-around entertainer, remember to practice dancing, singing, rapping, and writing music. It might seem like a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun! And as you keep practicing and working hard, you'll become the star you've always dreamed of being.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  and the situation: All marine creatures are not fish. There are some mammals, for example, whales, also live in the water. Rob wants to know more about differences between fish and other non fish creatures in the water. He divided them into two groups, group A and group B. Group A consists of fish, and group B consists of non fish creatures in the water. He started to see the differences between these two groups.  Answer the following question: In group B, would the eggs most likely develop outside or inside the mother's body? Answer:","output":"In Group B, which consists of non-fish marine creatures like whales, the eggs would most likely develop inside the mother's body. This group of animals are primarily marine mammals. Mammals, including those that live in water such as whales, dolphins, and seals, are characterized by giving live birth. This means that the fertilization and development of the embryo happen internally inside the mother's body. The young are then born live instead of hatched from eggs externally. They have a placenta which nourishes the developing embryo, unlike fish that lay eggs. Hence, the nature of reproduction differs significantly in mammals when compared to fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I expected  to see my father in the driver's seat. But to my surprise, I saw a young woman driving instead, \\"She has stolen my father's car,\\" I thought. So I quickly stopped a taxi and got in. I said to the driver, \\"Follow that new car in front,\\" I told him why. The taxi driver had a car phone, so I asked him to call the police. Soon we heard the sound of a police car. The police told the woman to stop the car using a loudspeaker. The taxi came to a stop, too. I got out right then and said to the woman, \\"This is not your car. It's my father's car.\\" The woman smiled and said, \\"Oh. You're Mr. Johnson's son, right? I've seen your photo in your father's office.\\" Before I could say one word, the woman explained that she was my father's new assistant . My father had asked her to take his computer to the shop to have it repaired. He lent her his car. After hearing this, I called my father and he told us what the woman said was right.

Measure the rice: Take a cup and measure the rice you want to cook. 2. Wash the rice: Put the rice in a bowl, add water, gently stir with your hand, then drain the water. Do this a few times until the water looks clear. 3. Soak the rice: Add clean water to the bowl with rice, and let it soak for15-30 minutes. This helps the rice get soft and fluffy. 4. Drain the rice: Pour out the water from the bowl, so only the rice remains. 5. Add rice and water to a pot: Put the rice into a pot, then add new water. For every 1 cup of rice, add 1.5 to 2 cups of water. This water helps the rice cook properly. 6. Bring to a boil: Put the pot on the stove, turn the heat to high, and let the water start to bubble. This is called boiling. 7. Lower the heat: When the water is boiling, turn the heat down to low and cover the pot with a lid. This will make the rice cook slowly, getting soft and fluffy. 8. Let it cook: Keep the pot with the lid on, for about 15-20 minutes. Don't open the lid or stir the rice! That will keep it fluffy. 9. Turn off the heat: After 15-20 minutes, turn off the stove, but leave the pot with the lid on for another 5-10 minutes. The rice will keep cooking with the steam inside. 10. Fluff the rice: Now remove the lid, and use a fork to gently fluff the rice. This will make it light and separate. And that's it! You have cooked fluffy rice to enjoy with your meal."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here we report the 261-Mb de novo assembled genome sequence of Oryza brachyantha. Low activity of long-terminal repeat retrotransposons and massive internal deletions of ancient long-terminal repeat elements lead to the compact genome of Oryza brachyantha. We model 32,038 protein-coding genes in the Oryza brachyantha genome, of which only 70% are located in collinear positions in comparison with the rice genome. Analysing breakpoints of non-collinear genes suggests that double-strand break repair through non-homologous end joining has an important role in gene movement and erosion of collinearity in the Oryza genomes. Transition of euchromatin to heterochromatin in the rice genome is accompanied by segmental and tandem duplications, further expanded by transposable element insertions. The high-quality reference genome sequence of Oryza brachyantha provides an important resource for functional and evolutionary studies in the genus Oryza..

This connection appears to be significant as Nikki stands as their only friend from that period of their life. As a result, the bond they share holds a special place in the narrator's heart. The mention of their friendship indicates that the narrator cherishes it deeply. Furthermore, the denial of having any ulterior motives related to Nikki for wanting to visit Niihau suggests that perhaps there is something more to their relationship that the narrator is unwilling to admit. This denial highlights the depth of their connection, even if the narrator is unwilling to fully acknowledge it throughout the passage. Additionally, Nikki serves as a source of comfort and escape for the narrator, as they express the desire to visit Niihau to escape reality and indulge in paradise. While the narrator tries to downplay any connection between Nikki and their reason for visiting Niihau, the passage implies that she might have some role in their desire to travel and seek refuge. The narrator's insistence that their intention has \\"nothing, nothing at all\\" to do with Nikki could be interpreted as a form of defensiveness or emphasis on the value they place in their friendship.

The father watches television until around 10 p.m. Given this information, the most plausible work shift for the father would be a day shift, which is typically 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. I deduced this based on these steps: Step 1: The father is already home and starts watching television immediately when the user gets home. This suggests that he finishes his work before the user arrives home. Step 2: The father continues watching television until around 10 p.m. This suggests that he doesn't need to get up very early for work, as he is staying up late.

Write an article based on this \\"A recovered drug addict and charity worker is to bury himself for several days and broadcast on social media.\\"","output":"Title: From the Depths of Addiction to Being Buried Alive: Charity Worker's Journey to Raise Awareness Introduction In a bizarre yet inspiring fundraising campaign, a charity worker and former drug addict has decided to take to social media in an unprecedented event. Choosing to literally bury himself alive for several days, his heroic venture will take the world by storm. As he live-streams his experiences from the confinement of a coffin, this brave individual aims to raise awareness about drug addiction and mental health, whilst supporting those still struggling to overcome the challenges they face. A Second Chance Once a drug addict himself, the charity worker, who we'll call as John, knows firsthand the difficulties encountered by those battling addiction. John's life took a turn for the worse, culminating in several run-ins with the law. However, through sheer determination, support, and extensive rehabilitation, he was able to rebuild his life and unearth a newfound purpose: helping others in need. John has stood as a testament to the transformative power of recovery and shown that no obstacle is insurmountable with dedication and support. Being Buried Alive – A Symbolic Act Many who suffer from drug addiction often describe the sensation of being shackled, imprisoned, or even buried in the darkness of their illness. John's decision to undergo such an extreme physical ordeal serves to mirror these feelings experienced by countless individuals every day. By breaking free from the confines of his temporary grave, John aims to show those still struggling with addiction that they, too, can find the light at the end of the tunnel. With this extraordinary act, he hammers home a crucial message: overcoming addiction is a possibility, support is available, and a new life awaits those who seek it. John hopes that his gesture will inspire and encourage others in their journey towards recovery, just as he himself has successfully emerged from the depths of addiction. Broadcasting and Social Media Exposure Throughout the days spent buried alive, John will actively share his experience with audiences worldwide, using social media as a platform to promote awareness and raise funds for people in need. Viewers will be able to directly interact with John during his live broadcasts, fostering a sense of connection and offering emotional support. In a world that often overlooks the human aspect of addiction, this intimate exchange serves as a reminder that those in the throes of drug dependency are more than just statistics – they are mothers, fathers, siblings, and friends. Supporting Mental Health Initiatives While John's efforts seek to address drug addiction, he also advocates for broader mental health initiatives. Mental health and addiction often co-exist, creating a vicious cycle of self-medication and emotional pain. John's journey not only emphasizes the importance of overcoming addiction but also highlights the need for society to prioritize mental health resources and acknowledge the complexities surrounding these struggles. Inspiring Future Change As John courageously faces the darkness of a coffin to raise awareness and funds for addiction and mental health, he transcends the label of a \\"former addict\\" or \\"charity worker\\" – he becomes a beacon of hope, a glimmer of light in a seemingly impossible situation. His profound act will leave a lasting impact on viewers around the world, inspiring and encouraging change on both personal and societal levels. Conclusion With a spade in one hand and a fearless heart, John is ready to literally bury himself alive to deliver a powerful statement about his personal experience and to raise awareness about drug addiction and mental health. Through his extraordinary and inspiring act, John hopes to ignite hope in the lives of countless people, allowing them to triumph over the darkness and reach out for the help and support they so desperately need. As social media users from all corners of the globe bear witness to John's out-of-the-box campaign, one thing is certain: from the depths of addiction to being buried alive, change is possible for those who dare to believe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The feed was launched just over a month ago as part of a promotional push for their upcoming movie, \\"Muppets Most Wanted.\\" But in between quippy posters and ads for the film, which is a sequel to 2011's blockbuster \\"The Muppets\\" with Jason Segel, there are ingenious \\"selfies\\" from the Muppets crew. In fact, the first post was a coy snapshot from Kermit, Miss Piggy and Gonzo, with a filter in full effect: And the selfies grew more adorable -- and more hilarious -- from there: We now have evidence of the time Animal burst in on Beaker in the bathroom. And we know what Gonzo does after a hard day of stunts. \\"Gonzo treated himself to a massage today to try to work out all of his stuntman kinks.

Hypothesis: Manufacturing knowledge is acquired by the DOD but the knowledge doesn't always reach program decision-makers. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise clearly states that the Department of Defense (DOD) does acquire technology, design, and manufacturing knowledge continuously, even after a program has passed through three points where this knowledge should have been available. Considering the premise, the hypothesis is a logical interpretation, as the information gained isn't always delivered to the decision-makers on time. However, the premise does not specify the cause of the delay or the reasons why it's not always efficiently getting to the decision-makers - they could be numerous and varied, ranging from inefficient communication channels, too much data to sort through in a timely fashion, bottlenecks in the system for analyzing and disseminating information, or even possibly due to issues related to security protocols.  Despite that, in essence, when we consider the hypothesis's claim, it directly implies that while the DOD gathers knowledge, that knowledge does not always reach those who make program decisions thus rendering the knowledge potentially ineffective. The premise lays the groundwork for this by saying that the DOD continues to obtain knowledge even after the points at which this knowledge should have been leveraged, suggesting a disconnect in the proper utilization of this data.

Here's the step-by-step process: Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. 1531*z = (-912*z) + (-2352*z) + 271961 - 665151 The like terms on the right side of the equation are -912*z and -2352*z. Adding these together yields: 1531*z = (-912 - 2352)*z + 271961 - 665151 1531*z = -3264*z + 271961 - 665151 Step 2: Combine the constants on the right side of the equation. 1531*z = -3264*z - 393190 (Adding 271961 and -665151 together we get -393190 as the constant) Step 3: Move the -3264*z term to the left side of the equation by adding 3264*z to both sides. 1531*z + 3264*z = -3264*z - 393190 + 3264*z This simplifies to: 4795*z = -393190 (Adding 1531 and 3264 together we get 4795 as the new coefficient of z) Step 4: Solve for z by dividing both sides of the equation by 4795. z = -393190 / 4795 Step 5: Divide the constant by the coefficient. z ≈ -82 So, the solution to the math problem 1531*z = -912*z - 2352*z + 271961 - 665151 is z ≈ -82."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Pick from: [-] no. [-] yes.","output":"Yes, these questions are the same, as both of them are seeking guidance on how to regrow lost hair. To provide a detailed answer on this concern, please find the following information: It is indeed possible to regain lost hair to some extent, depending on the cause of hair loss, severity, and individual factors. There are various approaches to tackle hair regrowth, including medical treatments, natural remedies, surgical options, and lifestyle changes. However, it is important to note that results may differ from person to person and that some approaches may not be suitable or effective for everyone. 1. Medical treatments: There are two FDA-approved medications for treating hair loss: Minoxidil (Rogaine) and Finasteride (Propecia). Minoxidil is a topical treatment available in liquid or foam form that is applied to the scalp, while Finasteride is an oral medication for men only. Both medications have been shown to help slow down hair loss and promote regrowth. However, they cannot restore all lost hair, and discontinuing these treatments may lead to further hair loss. 2. Natural remedies: There are several natural remedies that some people claim have helped in regaining lost hair, but their efficacy might not be scientifically proven. Among these remedies are essential oils (such as lavender or rosemary), onion juice, and aloe vera. Additionally, you may try consuming more foods rich in nutrients like biotin, zinc, iron, and vitamins A, C, and E, which are known to support hair health. 3. Hair transplantation: Hair transplant surgery is the most effective way to restore lost hair permanently. This surgical method involves removing hair follicles from the back or the sides of the head and transplanting them to the thinning or bald areas. There are two main techniques: Follicular Unit Transplant (FUT) and Follicular Unit Excision (FUE). While hair transplantation can produce natural-looking results, it can be costly, invasive, and may cause post-operative complications. 4. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT): LLLT, also known as red light therapy, uses diodes that emit red light to stimulate hair growth. This treatment can be performed at a clinic or using hand-held devices at home. Some studies suggest that LLLT can improve hair thickness and density, but more research may still be needed to test its long-term results. 5. Microneedling: Microneedling, also known as collagen induction therapy, involves using tiny needles to create micro-punctures in the scalp, which promotes blood circulation and stimulates the production of collagen, keratinocytes, and growth factors. As a result, it is believed that microneedling can potentially encourage hair regrowth. 6. Lifestyle changes: Improving your overall health and well-being can have a positive impact on hair growth. Adopt habits such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress reduction, and proper hair care. Avoid tight hairstyles, excessive heat styling, and harsh chemical treatments, as they can weakened hair and lead to hair loss. It is crucial to identify the cause of your hair loss before attempting any treatment or remedy. Consulting a dermatologist or a trichologist is highly recommended for a customized approach based on your individual needs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sedimentary rocks are made when a lot of tiny pieces of stuff like sand, shells, and bits of other rocks get squished together over a very long time. Usually, this happens at the bottom of lakes, oceans, or even big piles of sand dunes.

Swedish Automaker Saab Files For Bankruptcy STOCKHOLM – Saab Automobile filed for bankruptcy on Monday, giving up a desperate struggle to stay in business after previous owner General Motors Co. blocked takeover attempts by Chinese investors. Saab CEO Victor Muller personally handed in the bankruptcy application to a court in southwestern Sweden, ending his two-year effort to revive the carmaker that over more than six decades has become known for its rounded sedans and quirky design features. The Vanersborg District Court was expected to approve the application later Monday. \\"This is the most unwelcome Christmas gift I could have imagined,\\" said Fredrik Almqvist, 36, who has worked at Saab's assembly line for nearly 17 years. While experts say the company is likely to be chopped up and sold in parts, local officials in the town of Trollhattan, where Saab employs more than 3,000 people, were holding out hope that a new buyer would emerge to salvage the brand. \\"Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its entirety,\\" Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement. Muller, a Dutchman, used his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran out of money just a year later. Even as production stopped and salary payments were delayed, Muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company's real estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China. He bought time by placing the company in a reorganization process under bankruptcy protection. But the deals fell through, blocked by regulators or by GM, which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of Chinese competitors. The final Chinese suitor, Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co., said it pulled out after the last proposal for a solution was rejected by GM over the weekend. \\"We were supporting them to the last moment, even up to 1 a.m. this morning we were discussing possible solutions by telephone, but due to GM's position, in the end Sweden's Saab filed for bankruptcy this morning,\\" said Rachel Pang, an executive director of a subsidiary company of Youngman and daughter of Youngman's founder, Pang Qingnian. Swedish lawyer and reconstruction expert Peter Smedman said the prospects of selling Saab during bankruptcy proceedings would depend on GM. \\"The licenses that GM has are crucial for the value of the company,\\" Smedman said. \\"If GM doesn't want to let anyone in because they are scared of competition in China, then there is probably not much (value) left.\\" Originally an aircraft maker, Saab entered into the auto market after World War II with the first production of the two-stroke-engine Saab 92. It soon became a household name in Sweden and in the 1970's it released its first turbocharged model -- the landmark Saab 99. To auto enthusiasts, Saab was known for its quirks such as placing the ignition lock between the front seats and becoming the first car to have heated seating in 1971. GM bought a 50 percent stake and management control of Saab in 1989, and gained full ownership in 2000. The aircraft and defense company with the same name remained an independent entity, building fighter jets and weapons systems. Saab Automobile's sales peaked at 133,000 cars in 2006. After that, sales dwindled to 93,000 cars in 2008 and just 27,000 in 2009, as GM -- itself in bankruptcy protection following the financial crisis -- prepared to wind down the Swedish brand. Muller stepped in after a takeover attempt by a consortium led by Swedish sports car maker Koenigsegg failed. Analysts expressed doubt over Saab's chances of survival under Spyker, which later changed its name to Swedish Automobile. Spyker manufactured only a few dozen high-priced cars a year. Without support from other investors, Muller's plans didn't seem credible, critics said. Concerns mounted as Saab failed to pay suppliers early this year. Production was stopped in March, restarted, then halted again as the liquidity crisis deepened. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Swedish automaker Saab Automobile filed for bankruptcy after General Motors Co. blocked takeover attempts by Chinese investors.

Despite selling the company's real estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China, Saab faced difficulties as production stopped and salary payments were delayed.

It contains outstanding acting (particularly from the underrated Callan), fine cinematography and a compelling storyline. In other words, it's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s. Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models, at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother (who happens to be missing an arm and a leg). When the models Callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead, the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity... but there is more to the picture than he is seeing. This film never received the praise it deserves. Most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time, but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  Now, I have a new situation: Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk.  Answer this question please: The farm of which brand of milk has a higher crop yield per hectare? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, the farm of Jean's milk, which is not organic, is likely to have a higher crop yield per hectare.

Passage:In August 1991, hard-line Communists launched a coup against Gorbachev; while the coup quickly fell apart, it broke the remaining power of Gorbachev and the central Soviet government. Later that month, Gorbachev resigned as general secretary of the Communist party, and Russian president Boris Yeltsin ordered the seizure of Soviet property. Gorbachev clung to power as the President of the Soviet Union until December 1991, when the Soviet Union dissolved. Fifteen states emerged from the Soviet Union, and of those states, Russia was the largest and most populous. Bush and Yeltsin met in February 1992, declaring a new era of \\"friendship and partnership\\". In January 1993, Bush and Yeltsin agreed to START II, which provided for further nuclear arms reductions on top of the original START treaty. The collapse of the Soviet Union prompted reflections on the future of the world following the end of the Cold War; one political scientist, Francis Fukuyama, speculated that humanity had reached the \\"end of history\\" in that liberal, capitalist democracy had permanently triumphed over Communism and fascism. Meanwhile, the collapse of the Soviet Union and other Communist governments led to post-Soviet conflicts in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Africa that would continue long after Bush left office.  Links: a. Boris Yeltsin b. Dissolution of the Soviet Union c. Russia d. START II Output:","output":"Part #1: Determine the year Bush and Yeltsin met Usage: Sample response: In the passage, \\"Bush and Yeltsin met in February 1992,\\" the year of their meeting is 1992.  Part #2: Narrow down terms important for the chosen year Usage: Sample response: The terms that might help us answer the question about Russia's GDP in 1992 are: a. Boris Yeltsin b.

Russia, I found that Russia's GDP in 1992 was 459 billion. This term allows me to determine Russia's GDP in the given year. Part #4: Indicate the choice that answers the question Usage: Sample response: c. Russia (I chose this term because it helps me determine the GDP of Russia in 1992, which is the year Bush and Yeltsin met)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness.

His crib floats to an abandoned zoo and is found by a flock of penguins who raise him as one of their own. 33 years later, during the lighting of Gotham City's Christmas tree, a villainous gang of carnival performers stage a riot. While Batman subdues the criminals, corrupt businessman Max Shreck falls through a trapdoor and is brought to the underground lair of Osward himself; who is now the grotesquely nefarious kingpin known as The Penguin. A former sideshow freak, The Penguin explains his desire to become a respected citizen of Gotham and blackmails Shreck into helping him. Meanwhile, Shreck's secretary, Selina Kyle, inadvertently discovers her boss's plan to illegally monopolize Gotham's supply of electricity.

Here's the step-by-step process we followed to treat the warts: Step 1: Gather Supplies Before starting, we gathered all the necessary supplies: table salt, a small container for mixing, a measuring spoon, cotton swabs, a clean towel, and adhesive bandages. Step 2: Clean the Affected Area Using warm water and a gentle cleanser, we carefully cleaned the area surrounding the wart to remove any dirt or debris. Afterward, we patted the skin dry with a clean towel. Step 3: Create the Salt Mixture In a small container, we mixed a teaspoon of table salt with enough water to form a thick paste. For greater effectiveness, we made sure the paste contained more salt than water. Step 4: Apply the Salt Paste Using a cotton swab, we carefully applied the salt paste directly to the wart, ensuring it was completely covered. This is an important step, as the drying effect of the salt helps to break down the wart tissue. Step 5: Secure the Paste with a Bandage To prevent the salt paste from rubbing off, we placed an adhesive bandage over the wart and surrounding area. This also created a barrier, which helped to prevent further contamination. Step 6: Leave the Salt Paste Overnight We let the salt paste work its magic overnight. This allowed for ample time for the salt to penetrate and dry out the wart. Step 7: Remove the Bandage and Clean the Area In the morning, we removed the adhesive bandage, and gently cleaned the area once more with warm water and a gentle cleanser. We noticed that, after several applications, the wart gradually shrank and eventually disappeared completely. Step 8: Repeat the Process Until the Wart Is Gone We continued to repeat the process every night until the wart disappeared. It's important to be persistent and patient, as the duration of the treatment can vary depending on the size and severity of the wart. In conclusion, we found that using a combination of salt and water proved to be an effective remedy for treating warts. By following these steps and being persistent, the warts eventually shrank and disappeared, much to our delight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Frost/Nixon Context: After the Watergate scandal of 1972 and his subsequent resignation in 1974, 400 million worldwide watch Nixon leave the White House. Among them is British journalist David Frost, currently recording a talk show in Australia, who decides to interview Nixon. Nixonâs literary agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Nixon ultimately demands 600,000, and Frost accepts. After persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship. Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators â Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. â to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon. Under the watchful eye of Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and under pressure from his own team to ask the tough questions, Frost struggles to get a word in as Nixon dominates with lengthy and self-serving monologues, fencing ably on Vietnam and boasting about his achievements in foreign policy. Behind the scenes, Frost's editorial team is nervous about his interviewing technique, and angry that Nixon appears to be exonerating himself. Four days before the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost receives a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon. In a drunken rant, Nixon declares that they both know the final interview will make or break their careers, and compares himself to Frost, insisting that they both came from humble backgrounds and had to battle the elite to make it to the top of...","output":"In the movie \\"Frost/Nixon,\\" which is based on the real-life interviews between a British journalist and former United States President Richard Nixon, the person interviewing Nixon is David Frost. The interviews were conducted after Nixon's resignation from office in 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. David Frost, who was hosting a talk show in Australia at the time, saw the opportunity to interview Nixon as a chance for the former president to redeem his public image and also to generate significant media attention and revenue. Frost agreed to pay Nixon 600,000 for the interview and enlisted the help of his friend and producer, John Birt, to make it happen. They traveled to California to meet with Nixon and plan the interview. During their preparations, Frost developed a relationship with a woman named Caroline Cushing and struggled to secure the interest of U.S. networks in airing the interviews. Ultimately, he decided to finance the project privately and syndicate the broadcast. To help ensure that the interviews were well-prepared and thorough, Frost hired investigators Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr., along with Birt, to aid in the process. While Frost was initially unsure about the specific goals of the interview, Reston pushed him to pursue a confession from Nixon regarding his involvement in the Watergate scandal. Over the first three recording sessions, Nixon proved to be a formidable interviewee, as he dominated the conversation with self-serving monologues and skillful maneuvering around questions about his foreign policy decisions. This frustrated Frost's team and raised concerns about whether Nixon was effectively exonerating himself during the interviews. In the days leading up to the final session, which focused on Watergate, Frost received a phone call from a drunken Nixon. In his inebriated state, Nixon acknowledged the high stakes of the final interview for both of their careers and drew parallels between their respective backgrounds and struggles. This phone call ignited a newfound determination in Frost to hold Nixon accountable for his actions during their final session. In conclusion, the person interviewing Richard Nixon in the movie \\"Frost/Nixon\\" is British journalist David Frost. The interviews were a significant historical and media event, revealing the complex interplay of politics, journalism, and the quest for truth in the aftermath of a major political scandal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answering Question 1: Experiencing a heart attack can be a painful event for some individuals, whereas others may only feel discomfort or no symptoms at all. When a heart attack occurs, the blood supply to the heart muscle is restricted or blocked, usually due to a blood clot. When the heart muscle is deprived of oxygen-rich blood, it could cause discomfort and varying degrees of pain. People who experience a heart attack may feel intense chest pain, pain in the arms, neck, back, and stomach, shortness of breath, nausea, and lightheadedness. Depending on the severity and duration of the heart attack, the pain and discomfort could range from mild to excruciating. As such, it would be quite difficult to make a blanket statement that a heart attack is a painful death. However, in many cases, it could be painful to varying degrees. Answering Question 2: There are a few possible ways to die with little to no pain, although it is crucial to remember that every individual's experience may vary given the unique circumstances and personal perception of pain. Deaths from natural causes, such as terminal illnesses, can sometimes include a reduction of pain near the end of life, particularly if appropriate pain management interventions are employed. Additionally, dying in one's sleep is common among older adults and is often considered a relatively less painful death, as the person is unconscious and unaware of the process. Another example is passing away under general anesthesia, where the person is in a deep state of unconsciousness due to the administration of medications, resulting in a painless death. While the concept of a painless death is subjective and open to debate, all of these situations allow for a less painful or completely painless passing in comparison to more sudden or traumatic causes of death. As for the answer to the question of whether the answers to these two questions would be the same (A) no or (B) yes, the response is (A) no. The two questions have separate answers, as a heart attack may be painful, while various other modes of passing may involve little to no pain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A funeral is a ceremony or service that is held in honor of someone who has passed away. It is an occasion where friends and family members come together to mourn the loss and pay their respects to the deceased person.  In most cultures, a dead body is prepared in accordance with their traditions and beliefs to be displayed at a funeral or religious service. This preparation may include embalming, dressing, and placing the body in a casket or on a funeral bier. Therefore, it is common for a dead body to be present at a funeral in an open casket for viewing, or sometimes it might be closed as it depends on the customs and the preferences of the deceased or their family members.  On the other hand, the other options provided may not be socially acceptable or common places to find a dead body: - Trunk: Finding a dead body in a trunk would likely be an alarming and unexpected situation, often suggesting criminal activity or an accident. - Basement: Although one might occasionally find a dead body in a basement (for instance, during a murder investigation or in the case of a natural death that went undiscovered for some time), this would also be an uncommon and potentially suspicious scenario. - Cemetery: While cemeteries are indeed the final resting place for dead bodies, the bodies themselves are usually buried underground and not directly visible or accessible. - Closet: Similar to a trunk or a basement, discovering a dead body in a closet would be disturbing and unusual, suggesting improper handling, hiding, or disposal of the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Prescott, Arizona (CNN)The days pass one after the other in Prescott, Arizona, without bringing any real answer about Kayla Mueller. For a year and half, Mueller's family in this idyllic town has lived with the knowledge that the Islamic militant group ISIS is holding the 26-year-old American aid worker. Publicly, they kept silent about her plight, with her captors threatening to execute her if the family spoke out. But on Friday, ISIS claimed that Mueller had been killed in a building that was hit during a Jordanian airstrike on Raqqa, the militants' de facto capital in Syria. \\"Friday was a dark day,\\" said Todd Geiler, a longtime friend of the family. \\"Punched a hole through you. A big hole.\\"","output":"A tragic story unfolded in the serene town of Prescott, Arizona, where the days went by with no real information about Kayla Mueller, a 26-year-old American humanitarian aid worker. Kayla's family had been living with the knowledge that ISIS, an Islamic militant group, had captured and held their beloved daughter and sister captive for a year and a half. They were unable to share her story publicly, as her captors threatened to execute her if the family spoke out about the situation. The locals of Prescott, Arizona, lived in a somber reality where they carried the burden, mourned their captured neighbor, and hoped for her safe return. The town that was once known for its idyllic setting slowly transformed into a place overshadowed by the cruelty of the world. On Friday, ISIS claimed that Kayla Mueller had been killed during a Jordanian airstrike on Raqqa, which is considered the militants' de facto capital located in Syria. A building that housed Kayla was hit, leading to her untimely death according to the terrorist group. This news brought immense grief to a close-knit community, leaving them mourning the loss of someone who was dedicated to helping others in need. Todd Geiler, a longtime friend of Kayla's family, described the mood in Prescott after receiving the devastating news: \\"Friday was a dark day. Punched a hole through you. A big hole.\\" The sudden and tragic loss of their fellow citizen left the entire town heartbroken, struggling to come to terms with the news and the reality of losing someone who had touched so many lives through her humanitarian efforts. As the days continued to pass in Prescott, Arizona, the residents began to lean on one another for support, love, and understanding. Stories of Kayla's dedication to aiding the less fortunate surfaced, painting a portrait of a selfless and loving young woman who wanted to make a difference in people's lives across the globe. Her tragic death served as a painful reminder of the harsh atrocities taking place in the world and the ruthless nature of the terrorist group that held her captive and ultimately claimed her life.  The people of Prescott, Arizona, like the Mueller family, will forever remember Kayla as a light in their community – a beacon of hope, selflessness, and kindness who, despite being faced with her own terrifying circumstances, never wavered in her commitment to making the world a better place."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Read this: The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called Miami oolite or Miami limestone. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than 50 feet (15 m) thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glaciations or ice ages. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet (8 m) above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida plateau, stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas. The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans. Starting about 100,000 years ago the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to 300 to 350 feet (90 to 110 m) below the contemporary level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago, leaving the mainland of South Florida just above sea level.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: angry  B: carefree and irresponsible  C: happy A:","output":"Based on the context provided, where Sydney lost Kai and did not look for her, the most suitable answer reflecting how Kai would feel as a result would be: A: Angry The reasons behind this choice are as follows: 1. Abandonment: Kai might feel abandoned by Sydney since they lost her and made no effort to search for her. This could evoke a sense of anger and frustration because she would feel unimportant to Sydney. 2. Betrayal: Kai may feel betrayed by Sydney's actions, or lack thereof. When someone you trust and rely on doesn't act accordingly in a time of need, it could lead to feelings of anger and resentment. 3. Vulnerability: Being left alone and not knowing where she stands with Sydney might make Kai feel vulnerable and exposed, leading to anger in response to her uncertain situation. 4. Emotional distress: The experience of being lost and not being searched for by a friend could be emotionally distressing for Kai. It is natural for those emotions to manifest in the form of anger. 5. Conflict in the relationship: This incident might create a rift or conflict between Kai and Sydney, as Kai could be upset and feel that Sydney does not consider her well-being or safety important enough to look for her.

Group Jones hiked north and camped there  overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.  But I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  What is an answer for this question: Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move slower?","output":"The group whose cans had the air molecules inside move slower is Group George. Since they vented their cans, the pressure inside the cans was allowed to escape, preventing the increase in kinetic energy and molecular movement that caused Group Jones' cans to explode."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you are on a budget, get them all ready.; (II) If you can't locate certain supplies, you can purchase them at a local supermarket or drug store. You'll need a fine or mesh net to scoop the tadpoles out of the water.; (III) Here are some quick tips and some basic instructions for catching tadpoles : Gather fish. Tadpoles are often more expensive than bait, so you might want to get at least a bigger amount.; (IV) Collect as many tadpoles as you think you'll need for the trip. Make sure you buy a catching tackle kit.; The answer is:","output":"(II) If you can't locate certain supplies, you can purchase them at a local supermarket or drug store. You'll need a fine or mesh net to scoop the tadpoles out of the water. To catch tadpoles, it is essential to have the right equipment and supplies. A fine or mesh net is particularly important, as it allows you to scoop the tadpoles out of the water without harming them. Other supplies you may need include a container with a lid to hold the captured tadpoles, a pair of waterproof boots to keep your feet dry while wading in the water, and gloves to protect your hands. It's also a good idea to bring a bucket or large container to hold water from the same environment where the tadpoles were captured. This will help maintain the right conditions for the tadpoles once they are transferred to your container. If you are unable to find the necessary supplies at home, many of them can easily be purchased at your local supermarket or drug store. When catching tadpoles, it's important to approach the process with care and consideration for the wellbeing of these small creatures. In addition to gathering supplies, it is helpful to research the particular species of tadpole you are interested in catching, as well as the appropriate habitat and conditions for that species. This will allow you to identify the best locations and methods for capturing the tadpoles. For example, some tadpoles can be found in shallow, slow-moving water, while others prefer deeper, faster currents. Once you have gathered all necessary supplies and familiarized yourself with the suitable habitat for your tadpoles, you can begin the process of catching them. To do this, wear your waterproof boots and enter the water with your net in hand. Keep your movements slow and gentle to avoid disturbing the tadpoles. When you spot a tadpole, lower the net into the water near the creature, then quickly and carefully swoop it up. Transfer the captured tadpole into your container, taking care not to injure the animal in the process. Try to catch the tadpoles in the same water they are living in, and once you have captured the desired amount, promptly secure the lid on your container to prevent escape. To transport the tadpoles back to their new home, ensure that there is plenty of the original water in the container, as well as some aquatic vegetation, if possible, to provide cover and a source of food. Upon reaching their new home, such as a pond or aquarium, gently acclimate the tadpoles to their new environment before releasing them. In conclusion, catching tadpoles requires a delicate approach and preparedness with the necessary supplies, as well as respect for the animals and their wellbeing. With a bit of patience and care, you can successfully catch and relocate tadpoles in a way that is safe and enjoyable for both you and these fascinating creatures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.  - A supporting character is a character in a narrative that is not focused on by the primary storyline, but appears or is mentioned in the story enough to be more than just a minor character or a cameo appearance. Sometimes, supporting characters may develop a complex back-story of their own, but this is usually in relation to the main character, rather than entirely independently. In television, supporting characters may appear in more than half of the episodes per season  - The Red Book of Westmarch (sometimes Red Book of the Periannath, and The Downfall of the Lord of the Rings, also known as the Thain's Book after its principal version) is a fictional manuscript written by hobbits, a conceit of author J. R. R. Tolkien to explain the source of his fantasy writings.  - In literature, a conceit is an extended metaphor with a complex logic that governs a poetic passage or entire poem. By juxtaposing, usurping and manipulating images and ideas in surprising ways, a conceit invites the reader into a more sophisticated understanding of an object of comparison. Extended conceits in English are part of the poetic idiom of Mannerism, during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century.  - Hobbits are a fictional, diminutive, humanoid race who inhabit the lands of Middle-earth in J. R. R. Tolkiens fiction. They are also referred to as Halflings.  - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892  2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\".  - Children's literature or juvenile literature includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children. Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader.  - Gandalf is a fictional character and one of the protagonists in J. R. R. Tolkien's novels \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". He is a wizard, member of the \\"Istari\\" order, as well as leader of the Fellowship of the Ring and the army of the West. In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", he is initially known as Gandalf the Grey, but returns from death as Gandalf the White.  - A humanoid (from English \\"human\\" and \\"-oid\\" \\"resembling\\") is something that has an appearance resembling a human being. The earliest recorded use of the term, in 1870, referred to indigenous peoples in areas colonized by Europeans. By the 20th century, the term came to describe fossils which were morphologically similar, but not identical, to those of the human skeleton. Although this usage was common in the sciences for much of the 20th century, it is now considered rare. More generally, the term can refer to anything with uniquely human characteristics and/or adaptations, such as possessing opposable anterior forelimb-appendages (thumbs), visible spectrum-binocular vision (having two eyes), or biomechanic digitigrade-bipedalism (the ability to walk on heels in an upright position).  - Bilbo Baggins is the title character and protagonist of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 novel \\"The Hobbit\\", as well as a supporting character in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". In Tolkien's narrative conceit, in which all the writings of Middle-earth are translations from the fictitious volume of \\"The Red Book of Westmarch\\", Bilbo is the author of \\"The Hobbit\\" and translator of various \\"works from the elvish\\" (as mentioned in the end of \\"The Return of the King\\").  - Middle-earth is the setting of much of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term \\"Midgard\\" of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, i.e. the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past. Tolkien's most widely read works, \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", take place entirely in Middle-earth, and \\"Middle-earth\\" has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium or its \\"fictional universe\\".

Which entity is this text about? James Buchanan Jr. was born in a log cabin in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania (now Buchanan's Birthplace State Park), in Franklin County, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan, Sr. (1761-1821), a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman (1767-1833). His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. The only president to remain a bachelor, Buchanan's personal life has attracted great historical interest. His biographer Jean Baker argues that Buchanan was asexual or celibate. Several writers have put forth arguments that he was homosexual, including sociologist James W. Loewen, and authors Robert P. Watson and Shelley Ross.  In 1818, Buchanan met Anne Caroline Coleman at a grand ball at Lancaster's White Swan Inn, and the two began courting. Anne was the daughter of the wealthy iron manufacturer (and protective father) Robert Coleman and sister-in-law of Philadelphia judge Joseph Hemphill, one of Buchanan's colleagues from the House of Representatives. By 1819, the two were engaged, but could spend little time together; Buchanan was extremely busy with his law firm and political projects during the Panic of 1819, which took him away from Coleman for weeks at a time. Conflicting rumors abounded. Some suggested that he was marrying for her money, because his own family was less affluent, or that he was involved with other women. Buchanan never publicly spoke of his motives or feelings, but letters from Anne revealed she knew of several rumors. Coleman broke off the engagement, and soon afterward, on December 9, 1819, died suddenly. Buchanan wrote her father for permission to attend the funeral, claiming \\"I feel happiness has fled from me forever\\"; However, Robert Coleman refused permission.  After Coleman's death, Buchanan never courted another woman, nor seemed to show any emotional or physical interest. An unfounded rumor circulated of an affair with President Polk's widow, Sarah Childress Polk. Some believe that Anne's death served to deflect awkward questions about Buchanan's sexuality and bachelorhood. During Buchanan's presidency, his orphaned niece, Harriet Lane, whom he had adopted, served as official White House hostess.  Buchanan had a close and intimate relationship with William Rufus King, an Alabamian politician who briefly served as vice president under Franklin Pierce. Buchanan and King lived together in a Washington boardinghouse for many years, from 1834 until King's departure for France in 1844. King referred to the relationship as a \\"communion\\", and the two attended social functions together. Contemporaries also noted the closeness. Andrew Jackson called King \\"Miss Nancy\\" and prominent Democrat Aaron V. Brown referred to King as Buchanan's \\"better half\\", \\"wife\\" and \\"Aunt Fancy\\" (the former being a 19th-century euphemism for an effeminate man), Sociologist Loewen noted that \\"wags\\" described Buchanan and King as \\"Siamese twins\\", that Buchanan late in life wrote a letter acknowledging that he might marry a woman who could accept his \\"lack of ardent or romantic affection\\", and also that Buchanan was expelled from his Lancaster church, reportedly for pro-slavery views acquired during the King relationship. Catherine Thompson, the wife of cabinet member Jacob Thompson, later noted that \\"there was something unhealthy in the president's attitude\\". King became ill in 1853 and died of tuberculosis shortly after Pierce's inauguration, four years before Buchanan became president. Buchanan described him as \\"among the best, the purest and most consistent public men I have known.\\" Jean Baker's biography of Buchanan notes that his and King's nieces may have destroyed some correspondence between Buchanan and King. She opines that the length and intimacy of their surviving letters (one written by King upon his ambassadorial departure being specifically cited by Loewen) illustrate only \\"the affection of a special friendship.\\"","output":"This text is about James Buchanan Jr., the 15th President of the United States who served from 1857 to 1861. Born in Pennsylvania, he was of Ulster Scottish descent, and his parents were James Buchanan Sr., a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman. Buchanan has drawn historical interest due to his status as the only U.S. President to remain a bachelor and his personal relationships, particularly his close friendship with William Rufus King, which has led some to speculate about his sexual orientation.

If you want to make friends with famous people just to use them, keep in mind that they will probably see right through you. Famous people deal with strangers who just want to use them for their money or connections all the time, and they will be able to tell if that’s the case with you. Make sure you are trying to establish a friendship for the right reasons. For example, if you do make friends with someone famous, pay your own way. If they offer to pay for things, that’s fine, but never expect or ask them to. Treat them like you would any other normal person. Famous people deal with obsessive fans all the time. They probably keep most people at a bit of a distance for a while until they’re sure that person genuinely wants to be their friend and isn’t just a crazy fan. Many famous people don’t communicate directly with fans online, or answer private messages. It might be very difficult to become friends with famous people at all. Give it time if you have started communicating with someone famous. Don’t expect a relationship to happen overnight. They will probably need some time to trust you and decide they want to meet you or hang out with you. Once you have made friends with someone famous, be a good person and a good friend to them. If you use them or act like someone you’re not just to keep their attention, they will more than likely notice and be turned off by it. Treat them like any other friend, and they will probably appreciate it. Famous people don’t usually want to be treated like they’re more important than anyone else, especially by people they consider friends. They would probably appreciate you treating them like a normal person, and like someone they can be themselves around. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of treating famous people with respect and maintaining boundaries, instead of stalking or harassing them, if one wishes to establish a genuine friendship.

Laura's A:","output":"Title: The Long Goodbye Genre: Drama, Mystery Plot: Edward Thompson, a 40-year-old recently unemployed engineer, living in a small town named Woodsville, receives a mysterious letter from his estranged childhood friend, Tommy, urging him to leave town immediately and meet him at an undisclosed location. Curious and desperate for a change in his life, Edward packs his bags and gets ready to embark on a journey filled with intrigue and unexpected turns. On the way out of town, Edward decides to stop by Laura's, a quaint family-owned diner where he and Tommy spent countless hours as children sharing stories, dreams, and aspirations. The diner is run by Laura, a strong-willed woman in her late 50s, who is well-known for her kind heart, generosity, and the best chocolate pie in the region. As he enters Laura's, the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the unique blend of spices from the kitchen evoke a sense of nostalgia, giving Edward some much-needed reassurance amidst his anxiety over the journey ahead. Sitting at the counter, Edward orders their favorite meal - a classic burger, fries, and the famous chocolate pie for dessert. While waiting for his order, he suddenly notices a dusty old photograph of a group of friends tucked away behind the counter - Edward, Tommy, Laura, and a young woman named Grace, who both men had a crush on back in the day. Grace had mysteriously disappeared right after high school graduation and left a void in the lives of all who knew her. Edward engages in conversation with Laura, reminiscing about the past, recounting stories from their adolescence, and inquiring about the fate of Grace. He soon realizes that Laura has been looking for Grace ever since her disappearance, driven by a sense of guilt that stems from a secret she had kept hidden for years. Laura eventually reveals that on the night of Grace's disappearance, she overheard a heated argument between Grace and Tommy discussing the consequences of their impulsive decisions and how it may affect their futures. Laura kept the incident to herself, fearing the inevitable heartbreak it would bring to those involved. Unbeknownst to her, that -- combined with family pressures for Grace to cease further contact with Edward and Tommy -- had driven Grace away. Inspired by Laura's confession and persistence in searching for Grace, a newfound purpose and determination washes over Edward. He embarks on a mission to reunite the group of friends and bring closure to the unresolved parts of their past. On his journey with Laura, Edward uncovers clues leading to Grace's potential whereabouts, reconnects with Tommy, and delves deeper into the truth behind Grace's disappearance. Meanwhile, he must also confront his own demons and face the consequences of long-lost feelings that have resurfaced. As the story unfolds, Edward and Laura must navigate through the twists and turns of their investigation, unearthing secrets that have been buried deep, hidden in the passage of time. They must also reconcile with the past, forgive themselves for their choices, and find a way to move forward in the pursuit of lost connections and truth. The movie reaches a climax when the trio reunites at a remote seaside cabin where Grace has been living in self-imposed isolation for years. In an emotional confrontation, the friends reveal their feelings, the reasons behind their actions, and work together to mend broken ties. \\"The Long Goodbye\\" is a story of friendship, lost love, and redemption that takes the audience on a heartfelt and gripping journey through the past. It reminds us that sometimes, the answers we seek, and the love we once lost, can be found by revisiting the places that shaped us, the people who inspired us, and the memories that molded us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this fact: \\"a complete revolution of the Earth around the sun takes one solar year\\" Now answer this question: \\"The earth has completed half of its yearly orbit of the sun and will complete the other half in\\"","output":"The Earth has completed half of its yearly orbit of the sun, which means that it has traveled approximately half of the total distance it covers in one solar year. A solar year, as mentioned, is the time it takes for the Earth to complete a full revolution around the sun. This period is approximately 365.24 days, which is the basis for our calendar year. As the Earth has completed half of its journey, it has taken about half of the total time period of a solar year to do so. Half of a solar year is approximately 365.24 days / 2 = 182.62 days. Therefore, the Earth will complete the other half of its yearly orbit around the sun in approximately 182.62 days. Throughout this 182.62-day period, the Earth will continue to move along its elliptical orbit around the sun, experiencing gradual changes in daylight hours and climate along the way. This half orbit will take the Earth from one solstice or equinox to the next, marking a transition from one season to another in various regions across the globe. In the Northern Hemisphere, for example, the Earth's completion of half of its orbit could mark the transition from the summer solstice, marking the start of the warmest season, to the winter solstice, signifying the beginning of the coldest months. Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, these seasons would be reversed. Over this 182.62-day period, not only will the Earth move through different segments of its orbit, but it will also experience axial tilts. This is due to the Earth's axis of rotation being inclined approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane. This tilt is responsible for the variation in the duration and quantity of sunlight received at different latitudes, which in turn influences the distinct seasonal patterns experienced on the planet. As the Earth completes the other half of its yearly orbit, its axial tilt will cause a continuous change in the position of the sun's apparent path across the sky, resulting in varying day lengths, solar angles, and solar energy received by different regions. In conclusion, the Earth will complete the other half of its yearly orbit around the sun in approximately 182.62 days, during which time it will undergo numerous astronomical and climatic changes due to its orbital position and axial tilt. These changes contribute to the dynamic and varied nature of Earth's environment and the climate experienced in different parts of the world."},{"instruction":"Available options: A). No B).

We need to find the ratio of their ages after 8 years. Step 2: Find the ages of Kamla and Nisha Let the ages of Kamla and Nisha be 6x and 5x respectively. According to the problem, 6x + 5x = 44 Combining the terms, 11x = 44 Dividing both sides by 11, x = 4 So, the current ages of Kamla and Nisha are: Kamla: 6x = 6(4) = 24 Nisha: 5x = 5(4) = 20 Step 3: Find their ages after 8 years After 8 years, their ages will be: Kamla: 24 + 8 = 32 Nisha: 20 + 8 = 28 Step 4: Calculate the new ratio Now, we need to find the new ratio of their ages: Kamla's age after 8 years: 32 Nisha's age after 8 years: 28 Ratio = 32 : 28 Step 5: Simplify the ratio To simplify the ratio, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. GCD(32, 28) = 4 Now, divide both numbers by the GCD: 32 ÷ 4 = 8 28 ÷ 4 = 7 So, the simplified ratio is 8 : 7 Step 6: Match the answer with the given options The correct answer, 8 : 7, corresponds to option c.

Article: Having determined what type of finish is on your floor by following the instructions for Preparing the Floor, buy a stripping solution that will remove that type. Also make sure the stripping solution is safe to use on hardwood, or whichever material your floor is made from. If you can't find a product that specifically matches the type of finish previously used on your floor, try out a \\"universal\\" floor stripping solution on a small corner of your floor to test it. Remove all dust and debris from the area using a dust mop if you have one, or a broom if not. Put on clean footwear afterward to prevent further dust from getting on the floor. Chemicals in the solution can be dangerous to the skin or create toxic fumes. Work in a well ventilated area and protect yourself with gloves, long sleeves and pants. Use goggles and a respirator mask for large stripping jobs or poorly ventilated areas. The respirator mask should be labeled as an organic vapor blocker. A heavy duty trash bag allows for easy cleanup and lets you use the bucket for other purposes later. Follow the instructions on the floor stripping solution to determine how much you need, and whether to dilute the solution with water. Have a mop ready.  The trash bag is especially essential for mop buckets, since you don't want to later clean your floor with residual floor stripping solution. A \\"strip mop\\" is a specialized mop that will do a more effective job, but any mop will do. You don't have much time to apply and remove the stripping solution, so it's important to have a second mop handy for cleaning up. The first mop will be too saturated with stripping solution to use for cleaning purposes. Stripping solution makes the floor slippery, so plan your route in advance to avoid having to walk over it. Scrub the floor evenly and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, but do not allow it to dry.  Try to agitate the finish with your mop as you apply the stripping solution. The stripping solution should change color as it removes and mingles with the finish over the next few minutes.  If you are stripping a large floor, do so in small sections so the stripping solution doesn't dry. For large jobs, an auto scrubber or rotary machine is recommended, as it will do a thorough job pulling up all the finish.  If using an auto scrubber, scrub the area leaving the squeegee tool up (not in use). If using a floor machine or burnishing machine, use the stripping pad attachment. Large jobs may require multiple stripping pads. You can use a doodle pad for this or a long handled razor blade tool such as a poll scraper. If you don't want to buy a specialized tool, any sharp flat blade such as a putty knife will do the job. Without stepping on the slippery floor stripping solution, use the blade to work the wax away from edges, where the stripping solution and mop have difficulty pulling off the finish. You may need to scrub the baseboard as well, if it has picked up wax residue. You can purchase a special baseboard stripping pad if you are using a floor machine. Do this after the finish has been worked off but before the solution has dried. If you worked in the stripping solution with an auto scrubber, simply lower the squeegee attachment and pick it up again. Otherwise, you'll need a wet vacuum to remove the solution. If a section begins to dry out, pour a little water from your clean water bucket to keep it wet. Rinse several times to ensure all stripping solution is removed. You can add a stripping neutralizer to your water to ensure the next wax will adhere properly. If you don't want to buy one, simply wash it thoroughly several times. You can use an auto scrubber or floor machine for this step as well, as long as you change the pad beforehand. Don't use the same pad you used to apply or wipe up the stripping solution. Thoroughly clean any tools used, including the interior of machinery hoses and tanks. If left uncleaned, the stripping solution will dry into a hardened mess and ruin your tools. Don't move on to waxing your floor until it is completely dry, or the wax may not attach properly. You can put a fan in the room to hasten the drying process. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides a detailed guide on how to strip a floor finish, with safety and efficiency in mind.

Article: Who taught you to speak English? Your parents, while you were a child? Your teacher at school? Perhaps even the BBC as a grown-up. Whoever it was, somehow you have developed an understanding of what is rapidly becoming a truly global language. There are now about 376 million people who speak English as their first language, and about the same number who have learnt it in addition to their mother tongue. There are said to be one billion people learning English now and about 80% of the information on the Internet is in English. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Should we celebrate the fact that more and more of us can communicate, using a common language, across countries and cultures? Or should we worry about the dangers of \\" mono-culturalism\\", a world in which we all speak the same language, eat the same food and listen to the same music? Does it matter if an increasing number of people speak the same language? I would have thought the other way around  although I have never accepted the argument that if only we all understood each other better, there would be fewer wars. _ ... If we all speak English, will we then all start eating McDonalds burgers? Surely not. If English becomes more dominant , it will kill other languages? I doubt it. When I travel in Africa or Asia, I am always surprised by how many people can speak not only their own language but often one or more other related languages, as well as English and perhaps some French or German as well.

First, simplify the constants on the right side of the equation: 1055 - 2137 = -1082. So the equation becomes: -1057 = 5*a - 1082. Step 2: Isolate the variable (a). To isolate a, move the constant on the right side to the left side by adding 1082 to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out -1082 on the right side: -1057 + 1082 = 5*a - 1082 + 1082 This simplifies to: 25 = 5*a Step 3: Solve for a. Now, divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for a: 25 / 5 = 5*a / 5 This simplifies to: 5 = a So, the solution to the equation -1057 = 5*a + 1055 -2137 is a = 5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom (Billy Mauch) is the son of vicious criminal John Canty (Barton MacLane), while Edward VI (Bobby Mauch) is a prince and the heir of King Henry VIII of England (Montagu Love). One grows up in poverty, hungering for something better for himself and his family, the other in isolated luxury, with a strong curiosity about the outside world. When they are youngsters, they meet and are astounded by their striking resemblance to each other. As a prank, they exchange clothes, but the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale, Sr.) mistakes the prince for the pauper and throws him out of the palace grounds. Tom is unable to convince anybody except for the Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains) of his identity. Everyone else is convinced that he is mentally ill. When Henry VIII dies, Hertford threatens to expose Tom unless he does as he is told. Hertford also blackmails the Captain into searching for the real prince to eliminate the dangerous loose end. Meanwhile, Edward finds an amused, if disbelieving protector in Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn). An attempt to assassinate the boy on the instigation of the Earl of Hertford, who fears for his power if the real king lives, changes Hendon's opinion of Edward's story. With Hendon's help, Edward manages to re-enter the palace just in time to interrupt the coronation ceremony and prove his identity. Tom is made a ward of the new king, Hertford is banished for life, and Hendon is rewarded for his services.","output":"In the movie \\"The Prince and the Pauper,\\" the character that the guard mistakes for a Prince is Tom Canty, the pauper.

Choices:  - protractor  - resistor attachment  - Geiger counter  - ammeter  A: A:","output":"The device that measures the current flowing through a wire is an ammeter. An ammeter is a specialized instrument specifically designed to measure electric current, which is the flow of electrons across a conductor, such as a wire. Ammeters can measure different types of currents, such as direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). They are available in various formats - analog or digital, and different sizes - from small handheld devices to large, permanent installations in electrical control panels. While the other choices you mentioned serve different purposes, they are not used for measuring electric current flow: 1. Protractor: A protractor is a geometrical tool used primarily to measure angles. It is typically a semi-circular or circular device marked with degrees that allows users to measure the angle between two intersecting lines. 2. Resistor Attachment: This is not a standalone device for measuring current. A resistor is an electronic component that provides resistance in a circuit and can be used to control the flow of current. In some cases, a resistor can be used in conjunction with other devices to indirectly measure current by measuring the voltage across the resistor and using Ohm's Law (V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance). However, it is not a direct method of measuring current. 3. Geiger Counter: A Geiger counter is a device used to measure radiation levels, specifically ionizing radiation, such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. It operates by detecting the ionization caused by these particles or rays in the gas within a Geiger-Müller tube, generating an audible signal or a visual reading, depending on the design. In summary, the correct choice for measuring the current flowing through a wire is an ammeter. It is the most precise and straightforward method to obtain accurate current measurements in electrical circuits."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

It’s understood to be one of the most difficult games for computers to handle due to the sheer number of possible moves a player can make at any given point. Until now, that is.      Researchers at Google DeepMind, the Alphabet-owned artificial intelligence research company, announced today that it had created an artificial intelligence system that has beat a professional Go player at the game. The company’s research was published in the scientific journal Nature.      While winning at chess or checkers may seem like an intricate task, computers are able to essentially map out the consequences of every possible move, and choose the one most likely to lead them to winning the game. This style of processing, sometimes called “brute-force” computing—where the computer essentially wins by just computing as fast as it possibly can, wouldn’t work for Go. “There’s more configurations of the board than there are atoms in the universe,” Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, said in a video released by Nature. That means that even the fastest supercomputer wouldn’t be able to work through every possible outcome for every possible move on the board in any sort of reasonable fashion. Instead, a computer system would need to work more like a human.      Players often choose moves, Hassabis said, because they “felt right”—which is not a way a computer program acts. DeepMind’s solution was to build two neural networks—two computer systems that are modeled after the human brain, and can be trained on large data sets to perform certain tasks based on the knowledge it’s accrued. One of the networks, called a “value network” evaluates the computer’s positions on the board, and the other, a “policy network” decides where to move. Instead of evaluating every possible move, it selects a few moves that it senses to likely be potentially good moves.      Last October, DeepMind invited the reigning European Go champion, Fan Hui, into its UK office to play its computer at Go. Nature’s senior editor, Tanguy Chouard was present when AlphaGo took on Fan Hui and served as a moderator for the game. AlphaGo beat Hui in five straight games. DeepMind’s researchers said in their paper that AlphaGo “evaluated thousands of times fewer positions than Deep Blue did in its chess match against Kasparov.”      “It was one of the most exciting moments in my career,” Chouard said at a press briefing Jan. 25. But Chouard said the event prompted mixed feelings in him. While the technical achievement was worth celebrating, “one couldn’t help but root for the poor human being getting beaten,” he said.      AlphaGo had a 99.8% win rate against other Go programs, as well as beating Hui. And it will likely only get stronger with more training. “Humans have weaknesses. They get tired when they play a very long match. They can play mistakes,” Hassabis said. “Humans have a limitation in terms of the actual number of Go games that they’re able to process in a lifetime. AlphaGo can play through millions of games every single day.”      Google is by no means the only company or research institution that has been working on solving the Go problem. Prior to today, scientists had only been able to create systems that could beat a human with a few moves’ head start. And in December, a prominent AI researcher, Rémi Coulom—who’s spent years trying to crack the game, and is even cited in DeepMind’s research paper—told Wired that he believed someone would crack the game in the next ten years. A little over a month later, Google has done just that. And, not to be upstaged by Google, Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg posted this morning that his company’s AI researchers are also pretty close to beating the game.      Given enough training and processing, David Silver, a researcher at DeepMind, said in the video that he thinks it’s conceivable that AlphaGo could play the game at a level that no human could ever attain. Hassabis said that games like Go represent perfect stepping stones for researchers to hit on the pathway to potentially creating something that could be considered a true artificial intelligence system. AlphaGo is slated to face off against the reigning world champion of Go, Lee Sedol, in Korea in March.      As Google has cracked what has long been held as one of the “grand challenges” in AI research, giving credence to the idea that true, general-purpose, artificial intelligence may be possible.      “AlphaGo has finally reached a professional level in Go,” DeepMind said in its research paper, “providing hope that human-level performance can now be achieved in other seemingly intractable artificial intelligence domains.” ||||| The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away. ||||| In a major breakthrough for artificial intelligence, a computing system developed by Google researchers in Great Britain has beaten a top human player at the game of Go, the ancient Eastern contest of strategy and intuition that has bedeviled AI experts for decades.      Machines have topped the best humans at most games held up as measures of human intellect, including chess, Scrabble, Othello, even Jeopardy!. But with Go—a 2,500-year-old game that's exponentially more complex than chess—human grandmasters have maintained an edge over even the most agile computing systems. Earlier this month, top AI experts outside of Google questioned whether a breakthrough could occur anytime soon, and as recently as last year, many believed another decade would pass before a machine could beat the top humans.      But Google has done just that. \\"It happened faster than I thought,\\" says Rémi Coulom, the French researcher behind what was previously the world's top artificially intelligent Go player.      In theory, such training only produces a system that's as good as the best humans—not better. So researchers matched their AI system against itself.      Researchers at DeepMind—a self-professed \\"Apollo program for AI\\" that Google acquired in 2014—staged this machine-versus-man contest in October, at the company's offices in London. The DeepMind system, dubbed AlphaGo, matched its artificial wits against Fan Hui, Europe's reigning Go champion, and the AI system went undefeated in five games witnessed by an editor from the journal Nature and an arbiter representing the British Go Federation. \\"It was one of the most exciting moments in my career, both as a researcher and as an editor,\\" the Nature editor, Dr. Tanguy Chouard, said during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.      This morning, Nature published a paper describing DeepMind's system, which makes clever use of, among other techniques, an increasingly important AI technology called deep learning. Using a vast collection of Go moves from expert players—about 30 million moves in total—DeepMind researchers trained their system to play Go on its own. But this was merely a first step. In theory, such training only produces a system as good as the best humans. To beat the best, the researchers then matched their system against itself. This allowed them to generate a new collection of moves they could then use to train a new AI player that could top a grandmaster.      \\"The most significant aspect of all this...is that AlphaGo isn't just an expert system, built with handcrafted rules,\\" says Demis Hassabis, who oversees DeepMind. \\"Instead, it uses general machine-learning techniques how to win at Go.\\"      'Go is implicit. It's all pattern matching. But that's what deep learning does very well.' Demis Hassabis, DeepMind      The win is more than a novelty. Online services like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, already use deep learning to identify images, recognize spoken words, and understand natural language. DeepMind's techniques, which combine deep learning with a technology called reinforcement learning and other methods, point the way to a future where real-world robots can learn to perform physical tasks and respond to their environment. \\"It's a natural fit for robotics,\\" Hassabis says.      He also believes these methods can accelerate scientific research. He envisions scientists working alongside artificially intelligent systems that can home in on areas of research likely to be fruitful. \\"The system could process much larger volumes of data and surface the structural insight to the human expert in a way that is much more efficient—or maybe not possible for the human expert,\\" Hassabis explains. \\"The system could even suggest a way forward that might point the human expert to a breakthrough.\\"      But at the moment, Go remains his primary concern. After beating a grandmaster behind closed doors, Hassabis and his team aim to beat one of the world's top players in a public forum. In mid-March, in South Korea, AlphaGo will challenge Lee Sedol, who holds more international titles than all but one player and has won the most over the past decade. Hassabis sees him as \\"the Roger Federer of the Go world.\\"      Judging by Appearances      In early 2014, Coulom's Go-playing program, Crazystone, challenged grandmaster Norimoto Yoda at a tournament in Japan. And it won. But the win came with caveat: the machine had a four-move head start, a significant advantage. At the time, Coulom predicted that it would be another 10 years before machines beat the best players without a head start.      The challenge lies in the nature of the game. Even the most powerful supercomputers lack the processing power to analyze the results of every possible move in any reasonable amount of time. When Deep Blue topped world chess champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, it did so with what's called brute force. In essence, IBM's supercomputer analyzed the outcome of every possible move, looking further ahead than any human possibly could. That's simply not possible with Go. In chess, at any given turn, there are an average 35 possible moves. With Go—in which two players compete with polished stones on 19-by-19 grid—there are 250. And each of those 250 has another 250, and so on. As Hassabis points out, there are more possible positions on a Go board than atoms in the universe.      Players will tell you to make moves based on the general appearance of the board, not by closely analyzing how each move will play out.      Using a technique called a Monte Carlo tree search, systems like Crazystone can look pretty far ahead. And in conjunction with other techniques, they can pare down the field of possibilities they must analyze. In the end, they can beat some talented players—but not the best. Among grandmasters, moves are rather intuitive. Players will tell you to make moves based on the general appearance of the board, not by closely analyzing how each move might play out. \\"Good positions look good,\\" says Hassabis, himself a Go player. \\"It seems to follow some kind of aesthetic. That's why it has been such a fascinating game for thousands of years.\\"      But as 2014 gave way to 2015, several AI experts, including researchers at the University of Edinburgh and Facebook as well as the team at DeepMind, started applying deep learning to the Go problem. The idea was the technology could mimic the human intuition that Go requires. \\"Go is implicit. It's all pattern matching,\\" says Hassabis. \\"But that's what deep learning does very well.\\"      Self-Reinforcing      Deep learning relies on what are called neural networks—networks of hardware and software that approximate the web of neurons in the human brain. These networks don't operate by brute force or handcrafted rules. They analyze large amounts of data in an effort to \\"learn\\" a particular task. Feed enough photos of a wombat into a neural net, and it can learn to identify a wombat. Feed it enough spoken words, and it can learn to recognize what you say. Feed it enough Go moves, and it can learn to play Go.      At DeepMind and Edinburgh and Facebook, researchers hoped neural networks could master Go by \\"looking\\" at board positions, much like a human plays. As Facebook showed in a recent research paper, the technique works quite well. By pairing deep learning and the Monte Carlo Tree method, Facebook beat some human players—though not Crazystone and other top creations.      But DeepMind pushes this idea much further. After training on 30 million human moves, a DeepMind neural net could predict the next human move about 57 percent of the time—an impressive number (the previous record was 44 percent). Then Hassabis and team matched this neural net against slightly different versions of itself through what's called reinforcement learning. Essentially, as the neural nets play each other, the system tracks which move brings the most reward—the most territory on the board. Over time, it gets better and better at recognizing which moves will work and which won't.      \\"AlphaGo learned to discover new strategies for itself, by playing millions of games between its neural networks, against themselves, and gradually improving,\\" says DeepMind researcher David Silver.      According to Silver, this allowed AlphaGo to top other Go-playing AI systems, including Crazystone. Then the researchers fed the results into a second neural network. Grabbing moves suggested by the self-play, this neural network looks ahead to the results of each move. This is similar to what older systems like Deep Blue would do with chess, except that the system is learning as it goes along, as it analyzes more data—not exploring every possible outcome through brute force. In this way, AlphaGo learned to beat not only existing AI programs but a top human as well.      Dedicated Silicon      Like most state-of-the-art neural networks, DeepMind's system runs atop machines equipped with graphics processing units, or GPUs. These chips were originally designed to render images for games and other graphics-intensive applications. But as it turns out, they're also well suited to deep learning. Hassabis says DeepMind's system works pretty well on a single computer equipped with a decent number of GPU chips, but for the match against Fan Hui, the researchers used a larger network of computers that spanned about 170 GPU cards and 1,200 standard processors, or CPUs. This larger computer network both trained the system and played the actual game, drawing on the results of the training.      When AlphaGo plays the world champion in South Korea, Hassabiss team will use the same setup, though they're constantly working to improve it. That means they'll need an Internet connection to play Lee Sedol. \\"We're laying down our own fiber,\\" Hassabis says.      According to Coulom and others, topping the world champion will be more challenging than topping Fan Hui. But Coulom is betting on DeepMind. He has spent the past decade trying to build a system capable of beating the world's best players, and now, he believes that system is here. \\"I'm busy buying some GPUs,\\" he says.      Go Forth      The importance of AlphaGo is enormous. The same techniques could be applied not only to robotics and scientific research, but so many other tasks, from Siri-like mobile digital assistants to financial investments. \\"You can apply it to any adversarial problem—anything that you can conceive of as a game, where strategy matters,\\" says Chris Nicholson, founder of the deep learning startup Skymind. \\"That includes war or business or [financial] trading.\\"      For some, that's a worrying thing—especially when they consider that DeepMind's system is, in more ways than one, teaching itself to play Go. The system isn't just learning from data provided by humans. It's learning by playing itself, by generating its own data. In recent months, Tesla founder Elon Musk and others have voiced concerns that such AI system eventually could exceed human intelligence and potentially break free from our control.      But DeepMind's system is very much under the control of Hassabis and his researchers. And though they used it to crack a remarkably complex game, it is still just a game. Indeed, AlphaGo is a long way from real human intelligence—much less superintelligence. \\"This is a highly structured situation,\\" says Ryan Calo, an AI-focused law professor and the founder of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington. \\"It's not really human-level understanding.\\" But it points in the direction. If DeepMind's AI can understand Go, then maybe it can understand a whole lot more. \\"What if the universe,\\" Calo says, \\"is just a giant game of Go?\\" ||||| Published on Jan 27, 2016      Go is an ancient Chinese board game, often viewed as the game computers could never play.

Test sentence: \\"Everyone should be able to defend herself.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"Yes, the test sentence \\"Everyone should be able to defend herself.\\" is a grammatically correct English sentence. Let's break down the components to understand its structure and correctness. 1. Subject: \\"Everyone\\" - In this sentence, \\"everyone\\" is the subject and refers to all people without distinction. This is an indefinite pronoun and functions similarly to a singular noun. In English, when discussing a group of people, it's common to use the pronoun \\"everyone\\" to represent all individuals within that group. 2. Modal verb: \\"should\\" - The modal verb \\"should\\" is used to express obligation, recommendation, or advice. In this context, it suggests that it's recommended or desirable for everyone to possess the ability to defend themselves. 3. Verb: \\"be able to\\" - This phrase is used to describe someone's ability or capacity to do something. In this sentence, it refers to the ability to defend oneself. Affirming that people should have this capability is the main message of the sentence. 4. Reflexive pronoun: \\"herself\\" - The reflexive pronoun \\"herself\\" refers back to the subject, \\"everyone,\\" and signifies that each person should be able to defend their own person. Reflexive pronouns like \\"herself,\\" \\"himself,\\" or \\"themselves\\" are used to indicate that the action of the verb is performed by the subject upon itself. In recent years, there has been growing awareness of the importance of using gender-neutral language. Thus, while the sentence is grammatically correct, it may be perceived as excluding people who do not identify as female. To make the sentence more inclusive, you could replace the word \\"herself\\" with \\"themselves,\\" which is now considered an acceptable gender-neutral form to refer to singular indefinite pronouns like \\"everyone.\\" The revised sentence would then be: \\"Everyone should be able to defend themselves.\\" This version maintains the same meaning while ensuring inclusivity for all gender identities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Bin Laden\\" correctly answer the question \\"Which Morrocans lived in Germany during the 1990s?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Bin Laden\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Which Moroccans lived in Germany during the 1990s?\\" Based on the paragraph, the correct answer should include Zakariya Essabar, Mounir el Motassadeq, and Abdelghani Mzoudi.

Jordan Sands is an awkward and nerdy 17-year-old girl with a bad case of allergies, who just became the woman of the house after the recent death of her mother. Her father David is struggling to make ends meet, while her 14-year-old brother Hunter drives the family crazy with gory pranks. They inherit their deceased mother's Great-Uncle Dragomir's castle in Wolfsberg, Romania after getting a package in the mail. After arriving in Wolfsberg, they meet the strange and steely castle housekeeper, Madame Varcolac. Varcolac discourages David from selling the property, but he ends up going on dates with and falling for the real estate agent Paulina von Eckberg. One day while snooping around Dragomir's lab, Jordan steps on a vial of strange liquid. Hunter manages to pull the pieces out from her foot, but Jordan's behavior changes, such as her allergies disappearing, seeing without glasses, and smelling things very far away. Hunter's friends explain that Jordan's behaviors are akin to those of a werewolf's, and that she is one either because of a bloodline curse, a bite from an infected person, or from getting blood of a werewolf.

Continue the following story. Derrick always lost the key to his car when at home unlike Hunter, due to","output":"his forgetful nature and disorganized lifestyle. Hunter, on the other hand, had always been the more responsible and orderly one among the two friends. He had a dedicated place in his home for each of his belongings, making it almost impossible for him to lose anything. However, on one fateful evening, everything changed. Derrick had just returned home from an exhausting day at work, eager for the relaxing weekend that lay ahead. As he lumbered into his home, he tossed his car keys onto a pile of clothes that lay carelessly at the foot of the stairs. Moments later, he noticed a mysterious envelope tucked under his door. It was old and worn, as if it had been passed down through several hands before reaching his. As Derrick opened it, he found an old map that seemed to be drawn by hand. It was accompanied by a cryptic message: \\"The key to finding your dream lies in accepting the chaos within.\\" Perplexed, Derrick decided to share the map with Hunter, hoping that his methodical mind might be able to decipher its cryptic meaning. Hunter was fascinated by the odd envelope and spent hours poring over the map. Soon, he realized that the map was centered on significant landmarks in their little town. He became increasingly obsessed with the riddle, feeling there was something significant waiting for them. Over the next few weeks, Derrick and Hunter took turns visiting each of the landmarks mentioned in the map, often after work or on weekends. They discovered that at each spot, there was a hidden object or clue that helped them understand the map better. It seemed as if someone had tailored the adventure specifically for them. Hunter's attitude began to change. Once obsessed with order and control, he now accepted the enigmatic nature of their adventure and began enjoying the chaos it entailed. Derrick, on the other hand, found that as he leaned into the uncertainty, he started instinctively remembering where his keys were, in addition to other things he usually misplaced. The final clue on the map led them to a hidden cave nestled deep in the forest at the outskirts of their town. As they ventured inside, they noticed the walls adorned with intricate paintings of the town's history — events that they had only heard stories of from their grandparents. At the very end of the cave, they found a small wooden chest, bound by rusty chains. As they opened it, they discovered a century-old journal belonging to the town's founder, who himself was plagued by forgetfulness. The journal detailed his journey through life, revealing how he embraced the chaos around him and eventually founded the town that Derrick and Hunter came to know and love. The adventure had changed them both profoundly. Derrick no longer lost the key to his car, having subconsciously adopted better habits during their quest. Hunter, once obsessed with order, learned that life could not always be controlled and that the beauty of the journey often lay in embracing the chaos. Throughout the rest of their lives, Derrick and Hunter would recount the story of the map and the hidden cave, cherishing the memory of the mysterious adventure that brought them closer as friends and taught them the importance of balance in their lives. And so, the two friends continued to traverse the winding paths of life, celebrating both the beautiful chaos and the hidden order within, forever grateful for the lesson found in that mysterious, hand-drawn map."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: If I tell you that A spectrum is formed by refraction of light by separating light into all different colors, and ask you the question \\"a spectrum is formed by refraction of light by separating light into all different what?\\", is the correct answer \\"categories\\"? The answer is:","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"a spectrum is formed by refraction of light by separating light into all different what?\\" is not \\"categories.\\" The correct answer is \\"colors.\\" A spectrum, in the context of light, refers to the range of electromagnetic radiation that we perceive as light, displayed in a continuous series of colors that make up the visible light spectrum. These colors, also known as wavelengths, include red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The separation and display of these colors occur due to a phenomenon called refraction. Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium (like air) to another (like a glass prism). When white light (such as sunlight) enters a prism, it encounters a change in the speed of light, leading to the bending of light rays. Crucially, different colors of light have different wavelengths and refractive indices, which results in each one bending by a different degree. The sequence of colors in a spectrum comes from the fact that the shorter wavelengths (blue, indigo, and violet) have greater refractive indices, meaning they bend more when passing through the prism. Conversely, the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) bend less, due to their smaller refractive indices. As each color bends at a unique angle, they end up being separated and arranged in a particular order, creating the spectrum. Spectrums are not limited to visible light; there are also spectrums for non-visible electromagnetic radiation, such as infrared and ultraviolet. Nevertheless, when discussing a spectrum formed by refraction of light, it is generally understood that this pertains to the visible light spectrum, which entails the separation of light into its various colors. To recap, the correct answer to the question is \\"colors,\\" as a spectrum is formed by refraction of light by separating light into all different colors. The term \\"categories\\" does not accurately convey the concept of different wavelengths and the range of colors present in a spectrum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was founded in 1871, and was the sport's international governing body prior to the formation of what is now known as World Rugby (WR) in 1886. It promotes and runs the sport, organises international matches for the England national team, and educates and trains players and officials.  - Rugby league football, usually called rugby league, is a full contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field. One of the two codes of rugby football, it originated in England in 1895 as a split from the Rugby Football Union over the issue of payments to players. Its rules gradually changed with the aim of producing a faster, more entertaining game for spectators.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest.

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Contact sports are sports that emphasize or require physical contact between players. Some sports, such as mixed martial arts, are scored on impacting an opponent, while others, including rugby football, require tackling of players. These sports are often known as full-contact, as the sport cannot be undertaken without contact. Other sports have contact, but such events are illegal under the rules of the game or are accidental and do not form part of the sport.  - Nathan Hines ( born 29 November 1976 ) is an Australian - born former Scottish international rugby player .

After the Empire lost the Balkan Wars (1912–13), it lost all its Balkan territories except East Thrace (European Turkey). This resulted in around 400,000 Muslims fleeing with the retreating Ottoman armies (with many dying from cholera brought by the soldiers), and with some 400,000 non-Muslims fleeing territory still under Ottoman rule. Justin McCarthy estimates that during the period 1821 to 1922 several million Muslims died in the Balkans, with the expulsion of a similar number. Millions of Muslims left the empire and migrated to what places?","output":"During the gradual decline of the Ottoman Empire, millions of Turkish-Muslims from its former territories in the Caucasus, Crimea, Balkans, and the Mediterranean islands migrated mainly to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace. This large-scale migration took place as the Empire lost territories from the 19th century to the early 20th century, leading to the displacement of millions of people. The Caucasus, as a former Ottoman territory, drove many Turkish-Muslims to seek new homes in Anatolia. The same situation occurred in Crimea, as those from the region migrated to secure areas in Anatolia and Eastern Thrace. The Balkan territories were another significant source of migration, particularly after the Balkan Wars (1912-1913) when the Ottoman Empire lost almost all its territories in the region, except for East Thrace. As a consequence, around 400,000 Muslims fled with the retreating Ottoman armies, while a similar number of non-Muslims left territories still under Ottoman control. In addition to these regions, Turkish-Muslims from the Mediterranean islands also migrated to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace during this period. The decline and eventual fall of the Ottoman Empire caused immense turmoil and reshaped the demographics of these areas. In summary, as the Ottoman Empire lost power and territories, millions of Turkish-Muslims were displaced, mainly migrating to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace in search of safety and security. These migrations shaped the demographics of the contemporary Turkey, as people from the Caucasus, Crimea, Balkans, and Mediterranean islands all sought refuge in what remained of the Ottoman territories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Assuming 20,000 person-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two- to six-person crews, each person-day would cost 7.5 million, less than half the inflation-adjusted 19.6 million (5.5 million before inflation) per person-day of Skylab.

Admittedly, you have to have a taste for films with screaming, hysterical dialogue, over-the-top acting, and melodramatic plot twists. But if you do, you're in for one hell of a treat. Sally Field plays Celeste Talbert, daytime TV's \\"Queen of Misery.\\" Celeste's cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of Lori Craven (Elisabeth Shue), her long-lost niece, and, simultaneously, Jeffrey Anderson (Kevin Kline - splendid as always), Celeste's long-ago lover. But Celeste has been hiding a deep, dark secret, and the arrival of Lori and Jeffrey might just bring it to the surface. Add in the diabolical Montana Moorehead (a wonderful Cathy Moriarty, in full \\"gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode\\"), who is trying mighty hard to destroy Celeste's career; David (Robert Downey, Jr.), the weenie-boy producer of the soap who's secretly plotting with Montana to ruin Celeste; and, Rose Schwarz (Whoopi Goldberg), scriptwriter and Celeste's one true confidant, and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos. Chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute (does anyone remember 'Mixed Nuts'?), but when done well, can be pretty damn funny! A major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look. Field, Kline, Goldberg, and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm. Shue is clearly the weakest link here, but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by Field, Kline, et al. Moriarty is a stand-out in the showy villainess role, making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see!! There are also lots of familiar faces that you'll recognize in small (but, nevertheless, all very funny) roles, including Carrie Fisher, Garry Marshall, Kathy Najimy, and Teri Hatcher. Director Michael Hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish. Mention must also be made of Robert Harling's screenplay, carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera. The dialogue is boiling over with great lines, delivered brilliantly by the actors (I'd be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvised). Look, if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it, get your hands on this one. If not for anything else, it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh! How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"This review is very positive and enthusiastic about the movie.

Gentlemen  I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal. We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all. Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse. They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being. They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability. To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers. Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes. Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco. The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity. Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products. Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees. Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed. All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks. Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC. The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal. The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning. I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when. I realize there are significant issues to be addressed. Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals. We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles. Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals. If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors. The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical. Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly. Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives. So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal. Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit. Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.

Sentence 2: \`\` Oliver Twist '' , published in 1838 , was one of Dickens ' best-known stories and became the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"Yes, both sentences convey the same basic information, but with some variations in phrasing and emphasis. The information communicated includes:  1. \\"Oliver Twist\\" is the title of a story (specifically, a novel) written by Charles Dickens. 2. The novel was published in the year 1838. 3. It is one of Dickens's well-known or popular stories. 4. \\"Oliver Twist\\" is noteworthy as the first Victorian novel featuring a child protagonist. However, there are subtle differences in the way the information is presented in each sentence: Sentence 1: - Emphasizes the publication date, placing it right after the title. - Uses the phrase \\"better known stories,\\" which is a slightly more moderate claim about the novel's popularity as compared to \\"best-known stories\\" in Sentence 2. - Separates the point about the child protagonist in the novel from the point about the novel's publication date by using separate clauses. Sentence 2: - Presents the title and publication date differently, using a single clause to emphasize that the novel was published in 1838 and was a well-known Dickens story (more directly linking the two points). - Uses the stronger claim \\"best-known stories\\" when describing the novel's popularity, which implies that it might be one of Dickens's most widely recognized works. - Combines the point about the novel featuring a child protagonist with its status as being published in 1838 by using the word \\"became.\\" In summary, while both sentences communicate the same key points about \\"Oliver Twist,\\" they do so with slight variations in phrasing and structure. Both sentences highlight the fact that the novel was published in 1838, is one of Dickens's well-known stories, and is the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist. The differences between the sentences lie in how they emphasize this information and the way they structure their clauses to convey these key points."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Published Thursday, Jan. 22, 2015)      More than 40 dogs have vanished from a North Texas county over the past two months, leaving behind no clues in a mystery that's devastated their owners.      \\"I'm horrified,\\" said Robin Lewis, whose family lost their black Lab, Jack, from their Decatur home in December.      \\"It's been really difficult trying to explain Jack's gone, and are we ever going to see him again?\\" said Lewis. \\"They're heartbroken. I'm heartbroken. My husband's heartbroken.\\"      Jack is just one of dozens of dogs who have vanished in Wise County.      On the very same day Jack disappeared, Decatur Mayor Martin Woodruff lost his daughter's pit bull and Great Dane, who disappeared from Woodruff's fenced-in back yard.      \\"Police dispatch said after several hours that this is very unusual,\\" said Woodruff.      Lewis agrees.      \\"I think it's very suspicious that three very large, friendly dogs disappear in the same neighborhood at the exact same time,\\" she said.      Since November, 40 dogs have been reported missing, according to the Wise County sheriff. There's no physical evidence that proves the dogs were taken. Still, neighbors have a growing suspicion that all the missing dogs are not just a coincidence.      \\"It's really disheartening to think that there are people out here that would do this,\\" said Woodruff.      \\"It begs the question of where are these dogs going? And who's taking them? And what are they doing with them?\\" said Lewis.      The Wise County sheriff said investigators don't have any descriptions of possible suspects or their cars. But he said people should be on the lookout for anything that looks unusual that might help bring forward answers. ||||| \\"It does have some eyebrows raised,\\" Sheriff David Walker said.      Jack went missing from Robin Lewis' back yard on Dec. 27 (Photo: Lewis family)      WISE COUNTY — Jack, a two-year-old black lab, has been missing from the Lewis family's backyard since Dec. 27.      His bright blue collar still hangs above his kennel.      \\"It makes me think of him,\\" said Robin Lewis.      But it wasn't until Robin turned to Facebook that she realized there may be much more to his disappearance.      \\"If you back track it to the beginning of November, it's frightening.\\"      Two dogs from her neighbor Jana's yard went missing on the same day.      Around the same time, Cassidy McKibben's four-year-old Jack Russell terrier, Lily, disappeared.      \\"I noticed that my fence was messed up, and I have posted something everyday since she's been gone,\\" McKibben said.      They would eventually learn more than 40 dogs have gone missing in and around Wise County in just the last two months.      \\"This is not normal, and it feels like something is wrong,\\" said Lewis. \\"It leads you to believe someone has taken our dogs.\\"      They've now enlisted the help of Sheriff David Walker.      \\"It does have some eyebrows raised,\\" Walker said.      Walker noticed that the numbers are much higher than they've ever seen, and there is speculation that this could be suspicious.      \\"Could they be using them in dog fights? It's possible,\\" he said.      The only lead they have is a suspicious car, spotted in Robin's neighborhood the day Jack went missing.      Optimism has turned rational. These families are hoping that, at the very least, a new family is taking care of their beloved dogs.      \\"We're at the point we're hoping someone bought our dogs,\\" Jana Woodruff said.

Not to slight DS9. That was a wonderful show in it's own right, however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted. Enterprise is that show. While having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it's own ways. It makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again. And that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved. Another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members. Viewers really cared deeply for the crew. Enterprise has much promise in this area as well. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems very promising. While sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, I feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical. I think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even, we get some very interesting ideas and television. Also, we should note the performances, Blalock is very convincing as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance. The rest of the cast delivered good performances also. My only gripes are as follows. The theme. It's good it's different, but a little to light hearted for my liking. We need something a little more grand. Doesn't have to be orchestral. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice. And my one other complaint. They sell too many adds. They could fix this by selling less ads, or making all shows two parters. Otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of Voyager.

However, they have some concerns regarding the light-hearted theme song and the high volume of advertisements during the show.

October 22] - September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer, woodsman, and frontiersman, whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States. Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now Kentucky, which was then part of Virginia but on the other side of the mountains from the settled areas. As a young adult, Boone supplemented his farm income by hunting and trapping game, and selling their pelts in the fur market. Through this occupational interest, Boone first learned the easy routes to the area. After the Revolution, Boone resettled in Limestone (renamed Maysville, Kentucky in 1786), then a booming Ohio River port. In 1787, he was elected to the Virginia state assembly as a representative from Bourbon County. In Maysville, he kept a tavern and worked as a surveyor, horse trader, and land speculator. He was initially prosperous, owning seven slaves by 1787, a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time. Boone became a celebrity while living in Maysville. In 1784, on his 50th birthday, historian John Filson published The Discovery, Settlement And present State of Kentucke, a book which included a chronicle of Boone's adventures.  The Revolutionary War had ended, but the border war with American Indians north of the Ohio River resumed with the Northwest Indian War. In September 1786, Boone took part in a military expedition into the Ohio Country led by Benjamin Logan. Back in Limestone, Boone housed and fed Shawnees who were captured during the raid, and helped to negotiate a truce and prisoner exchange. Although the war escalated and would not end until the American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, the 1786 expedition was the last time Boone saw military action.  Boone began to have financial troubles while living in Maysville. According to the later folk image, Boone the trailblazer was too unsophisticated for the civilization which followed him and which eventually defrauded him of his land. Boone was not the simple frontiersman of legend, however: he engaged in land speculation on a large scale, buying and selling claims to tens of thousands of acres. The land market in frontier Kentucky was chaotic, and Boone's ventures ultimately failed because his investment strategy was faulty and because his sense of honor made him reluctant to profit at someone else's expense. According to Faragher, \\"Boone lacked the ruthless instincts that speculation demanded.\\"  Frustrated with the legal hassles that went with land speculation, in 1788, Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). There he operated a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor's assistant. When Virginia created Kanawha County in 1789, Boone was appointed lieutenant colonel of the county militia. In 1791, he was elected to the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping.  In 1795, Rebecca and he moved back to Kentucky, living in present Nicholas County on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first governor of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued to make their way through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was he a married man?","output":"Yes, Daniel Boone was a married man.

Knowing the strength of the hydrogen peroxide solution will help you decide the best course of treatment, whether the burn affects the skin, eye, or digestive system. The container’s label will note its contents’ concentration.  Most household hydrogen peroxide solutions are about 3% hydrogen peroxide and 97% water. These can cause minor irritation to the skin, eyes, or digestive system, stinging, and/or whitening of the skin, but can almost always be treated by simply flushing the area with cool water. Products that bleach hair can contain between 6 and 10% hydrogen peroxide, and can be more harmful than standard household solutions. Industrial solutions contain between 35 and 90% hydrogen peroxide. These can cause chemical burns that require immediate emergency care. You may notice blistering on the skin. Call emergency services immediately to treat exposures to industrial hydrogen peroxide. Free the burned or irritated area from contaminated clothing as soon as possible, especially when exposed to higher concentrations. Take off any clothes, jewelry, or other accessories that might have been splashed or soaked. Place the clothing in plastic bags if the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is 10% or higher. Hold the affected area under cool running water to rinse away the solution and ease pain. Flushing under a faucet will effectively treat small patches of skin exposed to household concentrations. Take a cool shower to flush larger patches of contaminated skin or areas exposed to a higher concentration. Chemical burns that result from hydrogen peroxide exposure can be treated like thermal burns. Continue to flush with cool water until pain starts to subside, use a mild soap to gently wash the area, and apply an antibacterial ointment.  Avoid scrubbing or breaking any small blisters that develop. Consider applying an aloe vera gel to ease discomfort. Within a day of exposure, look for signs including worsening redness, irritation, and pus or discharge from the burn. Seek a follow-up examination if you experience any of these symptoms. Schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor, contact the medical professional who treated your wound, or visit a local clinic for a follow-up examination.","output":"This article talks about knowing the strength of hydrogen peroxide solutions for treating burns, and explains how to safely handle and treat different types of burns caused by hydrogen peroxide, like using cool water and following up with a doctor if needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the producer who provided the studio where the band that rehearsed in a deconsecrated church recorded their first single? ?  In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of 2 each per day.During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded its first single, \\"Radio Free Europe\\", at producer Mitch Easter's Drive-In...

Here, we can infer that the monetary value placed on these deaths is 0, which could imply either the consequences on healthcare costs are negligible or such deaths are considered not important in the context of the statement.

Test sentence: \\"She speaks too much clearly.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"The test sentence \\"She speaks too much clearly\\" is not a correct grammatical English sentence. There are a few issues with the structure and word choice that can be improved to make it grammatically correct. Firstly, the primary issue lies in the misuse of the adverbs \\"too much\\" and \\"clearly.\\" The adverb \\"clearly\\" modifies the verb \\"speaks\\" and indicates the manner in which she speaks. The phrase \\"too much,\\" in this context, doesn't accurately convey the intended meaning and is misplaced.  To fix this sentence, you can use the adverb \\"too\\" combined with an adjective or adverb to better express the idea that the speaker's manner of speaking is excessive. Here are a few alternatives to correct the sentence: 1. She speaks too clearly. (using \\"too\\" with the adverb \\"clearly\\") This sentence implies that the speaker's clarity in speaking is excessive and might have unintended consequences, for example, when trying to convey subtle messages or when attempting to speak in a casual and informal manner. 2. She speaks too much. (using \\"too\\" with the adjective \\"much\\") This sentence conveys the idea that the speaker talks excessively in terms of the quantity of speech or how frequently she speaks. This provides a different meaning than the first alternative and focuses on the amount of speaking instead of the manner in which she speaks. 3. She speaks too quickly. In this alternative, we replaced the adverb \\"clearly\\" with \\"quickly\\" and maintained the \\"too\\" to create a sentence focusing on the rapidity of speech instead of the clarity. As you can see, depending on the context and the intended meaning, selecting the appropriate adverb or adjective and using them in the correct combination will result in a grammatically correct English sentence. The test sentence you provided can be restructured into various alternative sentences, all with slightly different implications depending on word choice and placement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ford, one of the industry giants, is not being left behind. With bold claims and ambitious plans, the company has made it clear that they are heavily investing in the future of autonomous vehicles. This article dives into Ford's recent announcements, partnerships, and innovations as they ramp up their self-driving car plans in an attempt to dominate the market. 1. Ford's Massive Investment in Autonomous Technology: In an effort to secure a strong position in the self-driving car marketplace, Ford has announced that they would invest 11 billion in electric vehicles (EVs) by 2022. This colossal investment aims at launching 40 new EV models, out of which 16 are expected to be fully autonomous. This move demonstrates Ford's commitment to create safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly vehicles for the general public. 2. Partnership with Argo AI: In 2017, Ford made a significant move by investing 1 billion in Argo AI, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence company focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology. This strategic partnership has fueled Ford's self-driving car plans, fast-tracking their progress to achieve a level 4 autonomous vehicle. The collaboration aims to develop, test, and implement advanced sensing and computer vision technology to enhance the capabilities of Ford’s autonomous vehicles. 3. Testing in Multiple Cities: Ford has expanded its testing to several US cities including Miami, Washington D.C., Austin, and Detroit. This allows the automaker to gather diverse data from various driving environments and conditions. The tests enable Ford to fine-tune its self-driving technology to meet the diverse challenges faced in urban, suburban, and rural areas. 4. Expanding Self-Driving Services: Apart from merely producing self-driving cars for individual use, Ford is also delving into autonomous ride-sharing and delivery services. The automaker has joined forces with Walmart and Postmates to explore the possibilities of using self-driving cars for last-mile delivery services. This strategic move could position Ford as a major player not just in the transportation but also in the rapidly growing eCommerce industry. 5. Collaboration with Lyft: Ford has joined hands with popular ride-hailing service Lyft to further develop their self-driving technology. This partnership aims to integrate Ford's autonomous vehicles into Lyft's transportation network. By doing so, Ford plans to use Lyft's vast customer base and data-driven insights to improve their self-driving technology and scale their services efficiently. Conclusion: Ford's aggressive strategy to invest, innovate, and collaborate has set the stage for the automaker's self-driving car plans. While challenges such as regulatory approval and public acceptance are still significant hurdles, Ford shows no sign of slowing down.

Q: The purpose of any cooling system is to transfer what type of energy in order to keep things cool?   A: The answer is:","output":"The purpose of any cooling system is to transfer thermal energy, also known as heat energy, in order to keep things cool.  Step 1: Understand the concept of cooling systems Cooling systems help regulate and maintain temperature by transferring heat away from the object or space that needs to be cooled. Step 2: Know the type of energy Heat energy, or thermal energy, is the energy that flows from one object to another due to a temperature difference. It is the type of energy associated with the movement and vibrations of particles in a substance. Step 3: Relate the energy type with cooling systems In cooling systems, thermal energy is absorbed from the object or space that needs to be cooled and transferred to another medium, usually a coolant or the surrounding air, to dissipate the heat. This process helps maintain a lower temperature in the required area or object. Step 4: Justify the step The transfer of thermal energy in cooling systems is essential to keep temperatures regulated and prevent overheating or damage to equipment, electronics, or living spaces.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. Question: When was the curtain that exposed Santa's body opened? === The answer to the above question is  (A). not enough information. (B). While the boy and his mother were passing by.. (C). Before Santa's suit was cut into shreds.. (D). Before the mother insisted she knew how to parent.. The answer is:","output":"(B).

Some people might feel their hearts beating quickly while they are waiting for the test paper. A student with really strong test _ may even feel like he or she might be sick or throw up . Sound familiar? You'll find that just about all people--adults and others--have some anxiety before a test. According to studies, proper anxiety can be helpful, keeping you sharp and focused and even helping you get good grades.

Control of labour and inter-group conflict is characteristic of corporate-level or 'tribal' groups, headed by a charismatic individual; whether a 'big man' or a proto-chief, functioning as a lineage-group head. Whether a non-hierarchical system of organization existed is debatable, and there is no evidence that explicitly suggests that Neolithic societies functioned under any dominating class or individual, as was the case in the chiefdoms of the European Early Bronze Age. Theories to explain the apparent implied egalitarianism of Neolithic (and Paleolithic) societies have arisen, notably the Marxist concept of primitive communism. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What type of disagreement existed in tribal groups that were controlled by Neolithic groups?","output":"Since the question seems to ask about the nature of disagreements in tribal groups during the Neolithic period, we can attempt to provide an answer based on archaeological evidence and theories. In Neolithic societies, where a non-hierarchical system of organization is debated and there is no clear evidence of a dominant class or individual, the types of disagreements that may have existed could include the following: 1. Resource allocation: Disagreements may have arisen over the distribution of resources like food, land, or water. As populations grew and agriculture became more prevalent, the need for access to resources would have been more pressing. 2. Kinship and alliances: Tribal groups often had complex kinship structures and alliances with neighboring groups. Disagreements could have emerged over marriage arrangements, territory boundaries, and cooperation with allies. 3. Leadership and decision-making: In the absence of a clear hierarchy, disputes over who should lead or have the authority to make decisions could have been possible. Groups may have had to negotiate and reach a consensus on various matters, leading to disagreements. 4. Cultural practices and beliefs: Different tribes may have had distinct cultural practices and beliefs, leading to clashes and disagreements when encountering or interacting with one another. 5. Environmental pressures and changes: Natural disasters, changes in climate, or resource scarcity could have put pressure on Neolithic groups, leading to conflicts and disagreements on how to adapt to these challenges. It is important to note that reconstructing the precise nature of disagreements in Neolithic societies is speculative, as there is limited evidence available to inform these conclusions. However, these points can provide some insight into the possible types of conflicts that may have occurred in tribal groups during this time period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. What did Meg do after her anger simmered?  A. She asked her husband if he would have given up his seat?  B. She asked her husband what he would have done?  C. She asked her husband if he would have stood up?  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"It is not explicitly mentioned in the story what Meg did after her anger simmered. However, considering the situation and the events that took place, we can attempt to derive a reasonable response to the question. While choices A, B, and C present specific actions that Meg could have taken, they seem to be different versions of essentially the same question - asking her husband about his thoughts and actions in that particular situation. In the context given, it seems quite plausible that Meg would have wanted to discuss the matter with her husband and understand his perspective. Therefore, any of the options A, B, or C could be a possible and reasonable response that Meg might have taken after her anger simmered, as all three options involve seeking her husband's opinion on the matter. However, since the original story does not provide specific information on what Meg did or said after her anger simmered and only highlights the events leading up to that point, option D (\\"not enough information\\") is also a valid answer. In conclusion, while options A, B, and C are reasonable responses that Meg might have taken, the story does not provide sufficient details to ascertain her exact actions, making option D an accurate response as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The nearly decade long deflationary depression in Britain dating from Churchill's decision in 1925 to return Britain to the gold standard at the old pre-war, pre-inflationary par was the public policy backdrop for Hayek's single public engagement with Keynes over British monetary and fiscal policy, otherwise Hayek and Keynes agreed on many theoretical matters, and their economic disagreements were fundamentally theoretical, having to do almost exclusively with the relation of the economics of extending the length of production to the economics of labour inputs.

Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\"? A:","output":"Question: What were the key factors that led to the wider adoption of vinyl records after the Second World War, and how did record companies respond to this change in demand?

The U.S. Army's new ban on many types of ethnic hairstyles has African-American women who wear their coifs in dreadlocks, braids and cornrows in a twist. The Army's regulations stipulate such guidance as hair \\"must be of uniform dimension, small in diameter (approximately ¼ inch), show no more than 1/8 (inch) of the scalp between the braids.\\" Dreadlocks \\"against the scalp or free-hanging\\" are banned. \\"Unkempt\\" or \\"matted\\" braids and cornrows are also considered dreadlocks and \\"are not authorized,\\" according to the regulations that were updated this month. It's that type of language, words like \\"unkempt\\" and \\"matted,\\" that read to some African Americans, as code for racial bias. \\"These new changes are racially biased and the lack of regard for ethnic hair is apparent,\\" Sgt. Jasmine Jacobs of the Georgia National Guard wrote in a White House petition she started in late March asking the Obama administration to reconsider the policy. Currently, the petition has more than 13,000 signatures. White House petition. \\"We feel let down,\\" Jacobs told the Army Times. \\"I think, at the end of the day, a lot of people don't understand the complexities of natural hair. A lot of people, instead of educating themselves, they think dreadlocks and they think Bob Marley, or they see women with really big Afros and they think that's the only thing we can do with our hair.\\" The updates in appearance standards were crafted, in part, with the help of African-American female soldiers and are intended to clarify the professional look of soldiers, said Troy Rolan, an Army spokesman. Previous regulations did not specifically address things such as braid widths or numbers, or the definition of twist styles. \\"Many hairstyles are acceptable, as long as they are neat and conservative,\\" Rolan said, noting the Army has banned dreadlocks since 2005. If soldiers aren't happy, they can go through a formal process to request changes to the hairstyle regulations, the Army said. \\"We encourage soldiers to make use of this process by sending recommendations and examples of hairstyles which could present professional appearances and conform to the regulation,\\" Rolan said. The rules' conciseness isn't the problem, say some African-American women and black studies scholars. The problem, they say, is a perception that ethnic hair that is \\"natural\\" or not straightened with heat or chemicals is somehow unruly, unkempt and must be carefully regulated to fit within white cultural norms. Black female soldiers say new grooming reg is 'racially biased' \\"In a broad sense, it's just another example of U.S. institutions policing black style,\\" said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University. \\"And it's not that there aren't other examples of such policing among other racial and ethnic groups. But, given the fraught relationship between black identity and culture and what some Americans might perceive as 'normal,' it strikes a particularly dissonant chord among some blacks.\\" Mandating what should be done with black hair is a particularly sensitive matter. During slavery and for generations after, hair texture, along with skin complexion, was used to classify which slaves were more valuable, given jobs in the master's house rather than the field, and — by default — deemed beautiful. Straighter hair, lighter skin and features that looked white were considered preferred traits, African-American scholars noted. Those values were internalized and perpetuated within the black community for years in a way that was particularly damaging to the self-esteem of black women, African American scholars said. \\"The gender dynamic here is also important; hair is so tied to the idea of black womanhood and self-esteem,\\" Neal said. \\"There have been many stories, for example, of the extra scrutiny black women with locs or dreads face going through airport security. The Army's ban is just another knock from the dominant society that somehow black women are out of step with the so-called status quo.\\" Black pride and natural hair movements have emphasized that all hair types and the rainbow of skin hues are all beautiful. However, the Army's regulations, some natural hair advocates and African American scholars fear, might suggest to black soldiers that their tresses must be straightened or closely cropped in order to fit in and be valued. Army: Female focus group helped determine new hair rules. That type of pressure is \\"both unfair and racially biased,\\" said Imani Perry, an African-American studies professor at Princeton University. \\"While it is reasonable for the military to expect some degree of conformity and neatness in hairstyles, those expectations ought to take into account the variety of natural hair textures people have,\\" Perry said. \\"For many African-American women who have tightly curled, coily or kinky hair, cornrows braids and locs are styles that allow for ease of close to the head grooming. Hence, banning those hairstyles puts black female soldiers in a difficult bind with respect to the requirement.\\" That type of pressure is \\"both unfair and racially biased,\\" Perry said adding that the Army conformity isn't absolute because female soldiers are allowed to wear their hair long. \\"Likewise, consideration ought to be made for different textures of hair,\\" Perry said. \\"Otherwise, a burden is placed disproportionately upon some soldiers due to an immutable characteristic, natural hair texture that is tied to race.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The U.S. Army's new ban on certain ethnic hairstyles, including dreadlocks, braids, and cornrows, has been met with backlash from African-American women who claim the policy is racially biased.

Sentence: Emily likes to dress up for parties, while Rachel doesn't because... Option I: Emily is a model. Option II: Rachel is a model. Step 1: Comparing the subjects The main difference between the two options is the subject of each clause, Emily and Rachel. Both options are valid answers, but they provide different reasons for the observed behaviors. Step 2: Examining the sentence The sentence discusses the preferences of Emily and Rachel when it comes to dressing up for parties. It is important to find a logical reason why Emily likes dressing up and Rachel doesn't. Step 3: Analyzing the options Option I implies that Emily likes to dress up at parties because she is a model, but it doesn't provide a reason for why Rachel doesn't. Conversely, Option II explains Rachel's disinterest in dressing up by stating that she is also a model, which implies that she might not enjoy dressing up outside of her job. But in this case Emily's preferences are not explained.  Step 4: Selecting the best option Although neither option provides a complete explanation for both Emily and Rachel's preferences, Option II offers a more plausible reason for the observed difference in their behaviors.

Several factors contributed to their overall satisfaction with the dental visit, which will be elaborated upon below. Firstly, the absence of pain during the dental procedure played a significant role in the narrator's enjoyment. For many people, going to the dentist is often associated with feelings of discomfort and anxiety. In this case, however, the narrator's experience was pain-free, which made it stand out from previous dental appointments and substantially improved their mental and emotional well-being. Secondly, the presence of rock music in the dentist's office contributed to a lively and upbeat atmosphere, which likely had a positive impact on the narrator's mood.

Q: U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why was RealClearPolitics involved?

First, we need to simplify the equation by combining the numbers (without \\"p\\"). So we have: 0 = -507*p - (9145 - 4431 + 6947) Now, let's do the math inside the parentheses: - (9145 - 4431 + 6947) = - (1712 + 6947) = -8659 Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -507*p - 8659 Our goal is to find the value of \\"p\\". To do this, we need to get \\"p\\" all by itself. Let's start by adding 8659 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 8659 = -507*p - 8659 + 8659 This simplifies to: 8659 = -507*p Now, we need to get \\"p\\" completely alone. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -507: 8659 ÷ -507 = (-507*p) ÷ -507 When we do that, we get: -17.08 = p So, the solution to the math problem is p = -17.08!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Question: If you're removing dirt from a carpet while doing housework what do you need?  Choices:  - broom - effort - vacuuming - boredom - mop  The rationale to choose \\"vacuuming\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"Vacuuming is the most efficient and effective method for removing dirt from a carpet when doing housework, compared to the other choices provided - broom, effort, boredom, and mop. Each choice has its own merits and demerits, but ultimately, vacuuming offers a better solution for cleaning carpets for several reasons: 1. Broom: While a broom is a traditional tool for sweeping and cleaning floors, it is not suitable for cleaning carpets. Brooms are mainly designed for cleaning hard surfaces, and using them on carpets can be ineffective as dirt can become trapped in carpet fibers, making it difficult to remove. Additionally, a broom may spread or disperse the dirt over a larger area instead of removing it from the carpet. 2. Effort: Though effort is an essential factor in any housework task, it cannot be chosen as the most appropriate answer because effort alone cannot remove dirt from a carpet. The proper cleaning tools and techniques are necessary to achieve the desired results. Effort itself does not achieve results, and the right choice of action is crucial in determining the effectiveness of the effort applied. 3. Vacuuming: A vacuum cleaner is specifically designed for cleaning carpets and removing dirt, dust, and debris from them. The vacuum cleaner uses suction and sometimes a beater bar to lift dirt particles from the carpet fibers, effectively removing them from the surface. Vacuuming is a quick and efficient method for cleaning carpets, reaching deep into fibers and removing embedded dirt, pet dander, allergens, and other contaminants that brooms and mops cannot reach. Modern vacuum cleaners even come with specialized attachments or features that allow for more effective carpet cleaning. 4. Boredom: Boredom, although a mental state sometimes associated with performing repetitive tasks, has no direct influence or relevance to the process of removing dirt from a carpet while doing housework. Boredom may affect the motivation or efficiency of the person doing the work, but it won't contribute to the actual cleaning process. 5. Mop: A mop is mainly used for cleaning hard surfaces such as tile, linoleum, and hardwood floors. Using a mop on a carpet may not be effective in removing dirt, as the structure and texture of a carpet are completely different from those hard surfaces. Additionally, using water or cleaning solutions with a mop on a carpet may lead to damage and may not address the dirt embedded in the carpet fibers. In summary, vacuuming is the optimal choice for removing dirt from a carpet during housework, as it is specifically designed for cleaning carpets and offers a quick, efficient, and effective solution compared to the other options. While effort is a necessary component of any cleaning task, it must be combined with the correct tool - in this case, a vacuum cleaner - to achieve the best results and ensure the carpet is clean and well-maintained."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Akihito came to the throne 27 years ago on the death of his father, Hirohito      Japan's Emperor Akihito has strongly indicated he wants to step down, saying he fears his age will make it difficult to fulfil his duties.      The revered 82-year-old emperor's comments came in only his second-ever televised address to the public.      Emperor Akihito did not explicitly say he wanted to abdicate as he is barred from making political statements.      PM Shinzo Abe said the government would take the remarks \\"seriously\\" and discuss what could be done.      \\"Upon reflecting how he handles his official duty and so on, his age and the current situation of how he works, I do respect the heavy responsibility the emperor must be feeling and I believe we need to think hard about what we can do,\\" he said.      Akihito, who has had heart surgery and was treated for prostate cancer, has been on the throne in Japan since the death of his father, Hirohito, in 1989.      In his 10-minute pre-recorded message, he said he had \\"started to reflect\\" on his years as as emperor, and contemplate his position in the years to come.      Why can't the emperor abdicate? Abdication is not mentioned under Japan's existing laws, so they would need to be changed for the emperor to be able to stand down. The changes would also have to be approved by parliament.      What do the public think? Most support the emperor's desire to step down - a recent survey by the Kyodo news agency found more than 85% saying abdication should be legalised. But the move is opposed by some more conservative sections of Japanese society.      Is this the first time a revision of the law has been discussed? A debate about whether or not a woman would be able to ascend the throne was triggered in 2006 when the emperor had no grandsons, but was postponed after a boy was born to the imperial family.      What does the emperor do? The emperor has no political powers but has several official duties, such as greeting foreign dignitaries. Japan's monarchy is entwined in the Shinto religion and the emperor still performs religious ceremonies. He also plants and harvests a small rice paddy inside the palace while the empress raises silkworms.      If he were to abdicate, it would be the first time a Japanese emperor has stepped down since Emperor Kokaku in 1817.      The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says right wing nationalists who support Mr Abe's government do not want any change to the current law, which insists emperors must serve until they die.      Emperor Akihito said he hoped the duties of the emperor as a symbol of the state could continue steadily without any breaks.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption The emperor's historic address was watched on big screens outdoors in Tokyo      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Most Japanese favour changing the law to allow the emperor to abdicate      He said one possibility when an emperor could not fulfil his duties because of age or illness was that a regency could be established.      But he suggested this was not the ideal outcome, saying: \\"I think it is not possible to continue reducing perpetually the emperor's acts in matters of state and his duties as the symbol of the state.\\"      Akihito's eldest son, 56-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito is first in line to the Chrysanthemum throne, followed by his younger brother Prince Akishino.      Women are not allowed to inherit the throne and so Princess Aiko, the daughter of Crown Prince Naruhito, cannot succeed her father. ||||| Japanese Emperor Akihito commented on national television Monday about his ability to carry out his duties fully as he ages.      TOKYO—Japanese Emperor Akihito signaled a desire to abdicate because of age and ill health, potentially ushering in the most significant change to the imperial system in the postwar era.      “When the emperor has ill health and his condition becomes serious, I am concerned that, as we have seen in the past, society comes to a standstill and people’s lives are impacted in various ways,” the 82-year-old emperor said in a 10-minute video message broadcast Monday.      ... ||||| TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Emperor Akihito, 82, in a rare video address to the public on Monday, said he worried that age may make it difficult for him to fully carry out his duties, remarks widely seen as suggesting he wants to abdicate.      Public broadcaster NHK reported last month that Akihito, who has had heart surgery and been treated for prostate cancer, wanted to step down in a few years - which would be unprecedented in modern Japan.      Once considered divine, the emperor is defined in the constitution as a symbol of the state and the unity of the people. He has no political power.      Akihito stopped short of saying outright that he wanted to abdicate, which could be interpreted as interfering in politics.      “When I consider that my fitness level is gradually declining, I am worried that it may become difficult for me to carry out my duties as the symbol of the state with my whole being, as I have done until now,” he said.      Akihito took the throne after the death in 1989 of his father, Hirohito, in whose name Japan fought World War Two. He has sought to soothe the wounds of the war in Asia during trips overseas and tried to bring the monarchy closer to the people.      Akihito feels strongly that an emperor’s full performance of his duties is integral to his constitutional role, experts say.      Opinion polls show the vast majority of ordinary Japanese sympathize with the emperor’s desire to retire, but such a step would need changes to the law.      Akihito has been cutting back on official duties, with his heir, 56-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito, taking his place. There were limits to how far that could go, he said on Monday.      People watch a large screen showing Japanese Emperor Akihito's video address in Tokyo, Japan, August 8, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY      LEGAL CHANGES      The emperor also seemed to cast doubt on whether it was appropriate to use an existing system that would allow Naruhito to take over as regent if his father were incapacitated.      “Even in such cases (of a regency), however, it does not change the fact that the emperor continues to be emperor until the end of his life, even though he is unable to fully carry out his duties as the emperor,” Akihito said.      Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that, in view of the emperor’s age and the burden of his official duties, it was necessary to consider what steps could be taken.      The idea of abdication has sparked opposition from Abe’s conservative base, which worries debate of the imperial family’s future could widen to the topic of letting women inherit and pass on the throne, anathema to traditionalists.      Naruhito’s only child is a daughter. Only males can inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne, which after Naruhito would pass to his brother, Prince Akishino and then to nine-year-old nephew Hisahito.      Other conservatives worry devoting political energy to discussing abdication could sidetrack Abe’s push to revise the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution, which many conservatives see as a symbol of Japan’s humiliating defeat in World War Two.      With Akihito apparently rejecting a regency, the only options would appear to be revising the Imperial Household Law or enacting a special law allowing him to abdicate, said Naotaka Kimizuka, an expert in monarchies at Kanto Gakuin University.      “They will either revise the law without touching on (female) succession, or pass a special law,” he said, adding steps could be taken next year.      Slideshow (7 Images)      “It felt as if the emperor were saying ‘Please hurry’.”      It was the second time Akihito had addressed the public in a video message. The first was after a massive earthquake, deadly tsunami and nuclear crisis hit northeast Japan in March 2011. ||||| In TV address, 82-year-old monarch does not explicitly say he would stand down but raises prospect of appointing regent      Japan’s Emperor Akihito has made a rare televised address to the nation, expressing his fears for his health and his ability to carry on as emperor, and hinting that he wants to stand down.      In the 10-minute pre-recorded speech, the monarch, 82, said he wanted an orderly imperial family succession, stopping short of saying he intended to abdicate.      Japanese law says the emperor must serve until death and is forbidden from appealing directly for retirement or abdication.      Public broadcaster NHK reported last month that Akihito wanted to step down. No emperor has done so in the modern era, which began with the Meiji Restoration of 1868.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reactions to Akihito’s rare TV address. Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters      Once considered divine, Japan’s emperor is defined in the constitution as a symbol of the “unity of the people” and has no political power. Even expressing a desire to abdicate infringes on restrictions on political activity.      Such constitutional restraints made the public address by Akihito a masterclass in the art of circumlocution.      Reading between the lines, his choice of words also suggests that Akihito is looking to put an orderly succession process in place to avoid disruption to the everyday lives of Japanese people, and the burden on the other members of the royal family, caused by the impaired health and possible death of an emperor.      The period of mourning following the death of an emperor can take up to a year, but there is no respite from the public duties required of the incoming symbol of the state.      “The surviving family is inevitably placed in an extremely severe position. The thought that there may be some way to avoid this recurs in my heart,” he said.      In particular, Akihito said it was conceivable that a regent may be appointed to deputise for some duties, while acknowledging that under the present system the emperor would be expected to serve for his natural life.      Opinion polls have shown the vast majority of Japanese people sympathise with the emperor’s desire to retire, but legal changes would be needed to allow him to do so.      Speaking after the address, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, suggested the government may be open to changing the laws to allow for a smoother succession. “We must carefully consider what is possible,” he said.      There are four possible routes for the Abe government now that Akihito has made his wishes as clear as they are likely to get under the existing rules, said Prof Naotaka Kimizuka, of Kanto Gakuin University.      “First, the PM might merely continue as before, with no abdication and no regent. In a second scenario he may appoint a regent,” he said.      “Mr Abe might also move to alter those articles of the Imperial Household Law that govern abdication or retirement, and fourthly, the government might use this as an opportunity to amend the Imperial Household Law in its entirety.      “For myself, I see Mr Abe taking options one or two, with number three being the maximum concession he would be prepared to make at this stage.”                  Other observers believe it is time to give the man a rest.      “My take is that the government has little option but to make changes in the law for at least the current emperor to retire,” said Purnendra Jain, professor of Japanese studies at the University of Adelaide.

Jennifer liked to smoke pot but Laura like to smoke cigars.","output":"Jennifer and Laura had been friends since high school, and despite their different tastes, they had managed to maintain their deep connection. The two young women, now in their late twenties, often met up to relax after work or in the evenings to indulge in their respective passions - Jennifer smoking pot while Laura savored her cigars. Jennifer found solace in the calming effects of marijuana. As an artist, she noticed that her creativity was often enhanced when she indulged in a joint or two. The smell of the burning herb and the gentle buzz it provided helped her unwind, letting the weight of the day slip away. Moreover, Jennifer believed that smoking pot played a big part in the unique and intricate patterns she would weave onto the canvas in her small, downtown studio. As she enveloped herself in the fragrant smoke, her ideas flowed easily, merging with the array of colors on her palette. Laura, on the other hand, was drawn to the empowering aura and the captivating allure that cigars exuded. The rich, bold flavors signified a sophisticated and timeless charm, something she thoroughly admired. Laura was a successful lawyer, and the enigma shrouding the art of cigar smoking resonated with her strong persona; it represented both tenacity and strength. She would often retire to her favorite armchair late at night, a luxurious Cohiba in hand, contemplating the finer details of an upcoming case with each slow, deliberate puff. Despite their predilections, Jennifer and Laura respected and acknowledged each other's choices. They felt that their friendship was defined by an unwavering understanding and acceptance that allowed space for individuality. This balance was evident in the leisurely evenings they spent together on Laura's balcony, beneath a velvety night sky. The two friends would recline in their deck chairs, engrossed in an ambient conversation that would be punctuated by the occasional chuckle or sigh. As they enjoyed these moments, the fragrances of burnt marijuana and cigar smoke melded into a curious amalgamation that encapsulated the essence of their connection. It spoke volumes about their capacity to find harmony in their differences, as well as the unique bond they shared in spite of the diverging paths they had chosen in life. The air around them seemed to tell a story - the tale of Jennifer and Laura, whose fondness for smoking pot and cigars, respectively, was merely an element of their personalities, and not the entirety of their existence. The differences in their choice of smoke had, in fact, ignited an everlasting friendship, allowing them to seek comfort and solace in each other's presence.

Carson pulled the keys from Jordan's coat pocket and drove off in the car.  Given the context: How would Jordan feel as a result? Choices: [a]. deceitful. [b]. manipulative. [c]. confused. Answer:","output":"[c]. confused. Step 1: Analyze the situation In this situation, Carson has taken the keys from Jordan's coat pocket without Jordan's consent and drove off in the car. Step 2: Identify the affected person The affected person in this situation is Jordan, whose keys were taken and car was driven away without permission. Step 3: Determine the possible emotions Based on the situation, we have been given three choices of emotions to consider: deceitful, manipulative, and confused. Step 4: Evaluate each choice [a]. deceitful: This term generally refers to someone who is being dishonest or untrustworthy. In this case, Jordan is not the one who has acted dishonestly, so this emotion does not apply. [b]. manipulative: This term typically describes someone who is trying to control or influence others in a self-serving manner. Again, Jordan is not the one attempting to manipulate in this situation, so this emotion does not apply. Step 5: Choose the correct emotion Given the choices, the correct answer is: [c]. confused: Jordan would likely be confused about why Carson took the keys and drove off in the car without their permission or knowledge. This is a natural response to unexpected actions like these, and Jordan would probably wonder what Carson's motives were for doing so."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to talk about a man named Andrew David Truelove who did something not very nice. Andrew, who is 28 years old, was arrested in a place called Herndon, Virginia. This means that the police took him away because he did something wrong. The police visited Andrew's house, and they found two very special signs that were missing.  These signs were from playgrounds in two different places: one from a town called Mantoloking in New Jersey, and the other one from a place called Mystic in Connecticut. These signs were special because they were to remember children who had been in a very sad event called the Sandy Hook massacre. Now, Andrew is part of a group called the \\"Sandy Hook truthers.\\" They are people who think that this sad event with the children never really happened.

Question: Information:  - The Haplogynae are a clade of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided.  - The Prodidomidae are a spider family with about 300 species in 31 genera. They are sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders.  - Mesothelae is a suborder of spiders (order Araneae) that includes a single living (extant) family, Liphistiidae, and a number of extinct families. This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are only found in China, Japan, and southeast Asia.  - The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 175 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often applied to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other species of spiders. Among the Thomisidae, \\"crab spider\\" refers most often to the familiar species of \\"flower crab spiders\\", though not all members of the family are limited to ambush hunting in flowers.  - The Entelegynae or entelegynes are a subgroup of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. Almost all members of this group, unlike most members of Haplogynae (the other main group), have eight eyes, and females have a genital plate. However, some entelegyne species have no (or reduced) eyes, and six-eyed spiders do occur, for example in the genus \\"Lygromma\\" (Prodidomidae, Gnaphosoidea).  - The Mygalomorphae or mygalomorphs are an infraorder of spiders. The name is derived from the Greek \\"mugal\\", meaning \\"shrew\\", plus \\"morph\\" meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs).  - The Dionycha are a phylogenetic group of spiders ( Araneomorphae : Entelegynae ) with about 10,000 species . 17 families belong to this group , amongst others : Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , Gnaphosoidea , Thomisidae ( crab spiders ) , and the Clubionidae . Spiders in this group have better senses ( sight , hearing ) than others , some even show courtship dances and songs . The Dionycha probably evolved from the web - building Trionycha . Unlike these , the Dionycha have only two instead of three tarsal claws . The central third claw of the Trionycha is responsible for tracking the silk thread . Instead of this claw , Dionycha have dense tufts of scupula hairs that produce strong adhesion , enabling some species to climb glass . Most species hunt their prey instead of building webs , although some species of Trionycha ( members of Lycosoidea ) also hunt . There are no cribellate members in the Dionycha . The monophyly of the Dionycha has been disputed . Today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw evolved several times independently .  - Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. \\"L. senoculatum\\", \\"L. valencianum\\") and no eyes. The eyeless \\"L. anops\\" is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind \\"L. gertschi\\" is found only on Jamaica.  - Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade.  - Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders.  - Araneomorphae (sometimes referred to as Labidognatha) is an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment. Both Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae belong to the suborder Opisthothelae, which comprises nearly all extant species of spider. Mesothelae, the only other suborder in Aranea, includes only about 100 living species.   - The Gnaphosoidea or gnaphosoids are a superfamily of araneomorph spiders with seven families. A 2014 study did not find the group to be monophyletic.    'dionycha' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? she may not be real","output":"The review you've provided – \\"she may not be real\\" – does not clearly convey a positive or negative opinion about the movie.  Opinion-based reviews typically include some form of sentiment that allows us to determine whether the reviewer has a favorable or unfavorable view. Such sentiments might cover aspects like the quality of the script, the performances of the actors, the direction of the movie, its cinematography, among other things. Phrases that might denote a positive review could include ones like 'breathtaking visuals', 'excellent performances', 'intriguing storyline', etc. On the other hand, negative reviews are equally explicit with phrases like 'poor acting', 'boring plot', 'unsatisfactory direction', etc. In the case of \\"she may not be real,\\" it refers to a specific detail of the movie which we could interpret either negatively or positively depending on the context. For example, this sentence could be suggesting that a character in the film does not come across as believable or realistic (which would be a negative commentary on the storyline or the performance of the actress), or it might be stating that an artificial or imaginary character in the movie was portrayed convincingly (which would be a positive comment). Without additional context, it is impossible to definitively say whether this statement was intended to express approval or dissatisfaction regarding the movie. Therefore, it would be more beneficial if we had more information or the full review. A more complete review might give a more explicit insight into the reviewer's emotions and perspectives about the movie, offering a more comprehensive understanding of whether they had a positive or negative opinion about the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On Monday, the treasurer of the ruling Workers’ Party was formerly charged with corruption. The day before, enormous anti-government demonstrations filled the streets of more than 160 cities. The economy is faltering, inflation is rising and poverty reduction is at risk of stalling. Her cabinet are in crisis mode, but they are hamstrung by a fractious legislature and a debilitating scandal at the state-run oil firm Petrobras, which has led to investigations of 34 sitting politicians, including the speakers of both houses of Congress. Just five months into her second term, this is posing difficult questions not just for the president, but for her party — and for Brazil’s 30-year-old democracy. The latest blow was the formal indictment of João Vaccari, the Workers’ Party treasurer, who is accused of soliciting hundred of millions of donations from Petrobras executives. Prosecutors said they had ample proof that Vaccari knew the money was raised from bribes and kickbacks. Twenty-six others were charged. More will follow, many of them from the ruling coalition. Rousseff, who was chairwoman of the Petrobras board when much of the wrongdoing took place, is also under pressure. Although she is not under investigation and has denied knowledge of the corruption, members of the public are not convinced. Related: Brazil: hundreds of thousands of protesters call for Rousseff impeachment The Petrobras scandal was high among a long list of grievances that brought people to the streets on Sunday. Estimates of the number of protesters range from hundreds of thousands to more than 1.5 million — huge by any standard. Countless others also came to their balconies and windows to clang their pots and pans in disapproval at government policies. The domestic media reported demonstrations in more than 160 cities. It was a shock for the Workers’ Party, which rose to power through mass mobilisations, but now appears to have lost the streets. Pro-government rallies called by trade unions two days earlier attracted only a tiny fraction of this interest. In São Paulo, the turnout was around 10,000. In central Rio, it was probably less than 1,000. This was a sad echo of the early years of this century, when the first Workers’ Party President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva drew vast crowds to his campaigns, including students, social activists, union members, and anyone hopeful of change. In the past four years under Rousseff, however, the party has increasingly struggled to mobilise even the rank-and-file. The radical left has grown disillusioned by the compromises and failed promises of more than a decade in power, a burgeoning corruption scandal at the state-run oil firm Petrobras has paralysed the petrochemical and construction industries, choking job creation, and many former supporters who benefited from interventionist social programmes have started to fear they will slip back toward poverty as a result of the worsening economy. Adding a regional context to these woes, there are signs that poverty reduction is flatlining both in Brazil and Latin America as a whole. In response to the demonstration of public frustration, Rousseff and her aides are hastily drawing up a package of new measures to address public concerns about bribery, impunity and an economy in the doldrums. But many on the left warn that unmet expectations are the real danger for Rousseff. “The biggest risk for the PT (Workers’ Party) may not be the throngs that occupied the streets, but the crowd that stayed at home,” wrote columnist Eliane Brum, referring to former supporters who no longer feel motivated to march. Despite Rousseff’s electoral mandate, it will be hard to govern without popular support. “What we have today is an organized and popular right, which can bring thousands of people to the streets, and a fragmented and bankrupt left. This has never happened in the history of Brazil,” said Vladimir Safatle, a philosophy professor at the University of São Paulo. “This is a government that will try to survive, not rule…What we will see now is a complete paralysis, not just of the government, but of the historical development of the New Republic.” Rousseff , who has the lowest approval ratings of any president in 15 years, has asked for patience in dealing with what she describes as “temporary problems”, but the calls for her resignation or impeachment are growing stronger. There is currently no legal basis for this. Although her close aides have been implicated in the Petrobras scandal, prosecutors said last week that the president is not under investigation. But she may be politically vulnerable because impeachment decisions are made in Congress, where last year’s election weakened the Workers’ Party and left her with a more splintered coalition. Many on the right sense an opportunity. “The president has become even more trapped. She is virtually under siege, without congressional approval. To see such a situation in only the third month of new mandate means we will have a lame-duck president for a long period,” said Rodrigo Constantino, the president of the Liberal Institute. “The possibility of impeachment has also increased. It is still unlikely, but if the probability was around 10% before, then today it should be closer to 30% and rising.” The ruling party warn darkly that the opposition is plotting a coup against the president, who won with a narrow but undisputed victory in October. Some among the crowds in Rio on Sunday carried banners calling for military intervention, but such views were on the fringe of bigger rallies in São Paulo and elsewhere. The protests passed peacefully and were described by the justice ministry as “an expression of democracy”. It has been 30 years since the end of the military dictatorship. Although the flaws in the current system of government, particularly Congress, are increasingly apparent, most institutions remain considerably stronger and less politicised than in Venezuela or Argentina. The danger now is that stagnation and increasingly polarised public opinion could push either the government to crack down on its critics, or opponents to disregard the president’s electoral mandate. So far that has not been the case. Rousseff and her ministers will hope to placate some of the popular fury with fresh anti-corruption measures, but they are unlikely to prove any more effective than a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. The political paralysis looks set to worsen as the economy continues to flounder. The remaining three and a half years of the president’s mandate will test not only the patience of an increasingly unhappy electorate but also the robustness of a 30-year-old democracy.","output":"Title: \\"Brazil's Unraveling Crisis: Corruption, Protests, and a Faltering Economy Threaten Rousseff's Presidency and Democracy's Resilience\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"_  are stout-bodied with distinguishing features that include elongated cheek pouches extending to their shoulders.\\"  Context: \\"Other animals, such as rabbits and rodents, practise coprophagia behaviours - eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage. Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.\\"  Answer:","output":"Hamsters are the animals being referred to as stout-bodied with distinguishing features that include elongated cheek pouches extending to their shoulders. In the context provided, it is mentioned that other animals such as rabbits and rodents practice coprophagia behaviors, and among them are capybara, rabbits, hamsters, and other related species. Hamsters belong to the rodent family Cricetidae and the subfamily Cricetinae. These small mammals have become popular as household pets due, in part, to their small size and adaptability to living in confined spaces. The elongated cheek pouches found in hamsters serve important functions in their daily life. These pouches act as temporary storage for the transport of food from the foraging area back to the burrow. They also allow hamsters to transport bedding materials or to hide uneaten food from other animals. The pouches can extend to their shoulders, giving them the ability to carry a significant amount of food relative to their body size. Like other animals mentioned in the context, hamsters have a simple digestive system, unlike ruminants, which have a complex multi-chambered stomach for digesting cellulose-rich plant matter. Due to their simple digestive system, they are unable to extract complete nutrition from roughage on a single pass. To overcome this limitation, hamsters practice coprophagy, wherein they eat their soft fecal pellets to give their food a second pass through the gut. This allows them to extract more vital nutrients from the plant-based diet they consume. The soft fecal pellets are typically consumed immediately, thus ensuring the recycling of essential nutrients. These pellets contain partially digested matter, which helps the hamster to optimize their nutrient absorption. Hamsters also produce normal droppings that are not eaten. Coprohagy is a crucial survival strategy among hamsters and several other rodents. It provides them with the ability to extract maximum nutrition from their diet, enabling them to thrive in a variety of environments, despite having a simple digestive system as compared to ruminant animals. In summary, hamsters are stout-bodied animals with elongated cheek pouches that extend to their shoulders. This feature plays a vital role in their feeding and foraging behavior. Hamsters, like other related species such as rabbits, capybaras, and certain rodents, practice coprophagy – eating their soft fecal pellets – to obtain additional nutrition from their food, compensating for their simple digestive system in comparison to ruminant animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What are good gifts for a foreign visitor to bring when they're invited to someone's home in Slovakia for the first time? What are good gifts for a foreign visitor to bring when they're invited to someone's home in Ukraine for the first time?","output":"While the two questions you've mentioned may seem similar, they are asking about appropriate gifts to bring when visiting a home for the first time in two different countries – Slovakia and Ukraine. Both countries have their unique cultural norms and traditions, which can influence the types of gifts that are considered appropriate. Let's explore suitable gift ideas for each country in greater detail. Slovakia: When visiting someone's home in Slovakia for the first time, it is considered polite and respectful to bring a small gift for your hosts. Here are some gift ideas that would be appreciated in a Slovakian household: 1. Flowers: A bouquet of fresh flowers is a classic gift that is universally appreciated. In Slovakia, it is essential to present an odd number of flowers (except for 13, which is considered unlucky) as even numbers are reserved for funerals and mourning events. Avoid bringing lilies and chrysanthemums, as they are commonly associated with sad occasions. 2. Wine or spirits: Bringing a bottle of good quality wine or a local Slovak liquor (like Slivovica or Borovička) is an excellent choice, especially if you know your hosts enjoy a particular type of drink. Brandy, liqueur, and whiskey are also acceptable alternatives. 3. Chocolates or sweets: A box of high-quality chocolates or other confectioneries is a safe and delightful choice. You can opt for a local Slovak brand or bring something special or unique from your own country. 4. Souvenirs: A tasteful souvenir representing your home country can be a great conversation starter and allows your hosts to remember your visit fondly. Consider items such as handicrafts, cultural ornaments, or even a beautifully designed coffee table book of your country's landscape and history. Ukraine: When visiting a Ukrainian home for the first time as a foreign visitor, it is essential to follow cultural etiquette and bring a suitable gift for your hosts. Here are some ideas for gifts that would be well-received in Ukraine: 1. Flowers: Similar to Slovakia, a bouquet of fresh flowers is a customary and appreciated gift. Ensure that the flowers are presented in odd numbers, avoiding yellow flowers (associated with breakups in relationships) and even-numbered arrangements meant for funerals. Also, remove any plastic or cellophane packaging before giving your bouquet to the hostess. 2. Wine, champagne, or spirits: A bottle of high-quality wine or champagne is always a welcome gift. If your hosts enjoy spirits, consider bringing a bottle of Horilka (Ukrainian vodka) or another type of liquor such as brandy, scotch, or cognac. 3. Chocolates or sweets: Like Slovakians, Ukrainians will appreciate a box of fine chocolates or sweets. Try to find unique or high-quality offerings, and consider local Ukrainian brands or specialties from your own country. 4. Souvenirs: A thoughtfully chosen souvenir from your home country can be a fantastic way to share a part of your culture with your hosts. Handmade crafts, traditional objects, or even a coffee table book showcasing your country's natural beauty and history are all suitable options. In conclusion, while both questions relate to bringing gifts for the first-time visit to someone's home, they pertain to two different countries with their unique cultural norms and preferences. To ensure your gift is appropriate and well-received, it is essential to understand the particular customs and traditions of each country – Slovakia and Ukraine – as demonstrated in the gift suggestions provided above."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the girl that the Prince danced with at the Ball? is inside the article: Cinderella and the Prince are having a picnic to celebrate their one-year anniversary. Meanwhile, at the Tremaine mansion, Cinderella's stepsisters Anastasia and Drizella are bitterly doing Cinderella's old chores. Anastasia wanders off to avoid work and stumbles upon the picnic. When the Fairy Godmother drops her wand, Anastasia takes it to her mother. In the ensuing struggle, Anastasia inadvertently turns the Fairy Godmother into a garden gnome. Lady Tremaine, reveling at yet another chance to ruin Cinderella's life, uses the wand to go back in time to the day the Grand Duke fitted the glass slipper on Cinderella. She uses the wand to expand the slipper so that it can fit Anastasia, and the Grand Duke declares she must be the girl the Prince is looking for. Cinderella arrives on the scene too late, and Lady Tremaine destroys Cinderella's other slipper – the only clue to her identity that she was the girl who danced with the Prince on the night of the ball. Cinderella decides to follow Lady Tremaine and her stepsisters to the palace with Jaq and Gus. At first the Prince claims Anastasia is not the girl he danced with at the ball, but Lady Tremaine uses the wand to alter his memory, and he accepts Anastasia as his bride. Jaq and Gus witness this and inform Cinderella that Lady Tremaine has the Fairy Godmother's wand. Cinderella poses as a maid to get into the Tremaines' room, but she is spotted by Lady Tremaine and captured by the palace guards as an intruder. Cinderella briefly touches the Prince's hand and he begins to recognize her, but Lady Tremaine orders Cinderella placed on the next ship out of the kingdom. The mice find the Prince and explain the whole story to him, and he rides off to intercept the ship just as it leaves port. The Prince embraces Cinderella and his true memories return.

Question: Which of these can be recycled in an attempt to conserve resources? Answer:","output":"Recycling is a key component of modern waste management and plays an important role in conserving limited resources. Various materials can be recycled, with some of the most common ones being paper, plastic, metal, and glass. However, there are also other materials that can be recycled, such as electronics, textiles, and organic waste. Here is a detailed list of some of the items that can be recycled to conserve resources: 1. Paper and Cardboard: Newspapers, magazines, office paper, junk mail, envelopes, paper bags, cardboard boxes, and other paper-based materials can be recycled. They are broken down into pulp and then made into new products. By recycling paper, we help reduce the amount of trees that need to be cut down for paper production. 2. Plastics: Not all plastic types can be recycled, but recycling of plastic bottles, containers, and packaging materials is commonly practiced. Check for the recycling symbol on the packaging to identify recyclable plastics. Recycling plastics can reduce the demand for petroleum, as plastics are made from this finite resource. 3. Metals: Aluminum and steel cans, as well as other metal containers, are easily recyclable. This includes beverage cans, food cans, aluminum foil, and other metal packaging. Recycling metals requires less energy than producing new metals from raw materials, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 4. Glass: Glass bottles and jars can be recycled endlessly without losing their quality. Color-separated glass is crushed, melted, and then reshaped into new products. Glass recycling saves energy and raw materials such as sand, soda ash, and limestone. 5. Electronics: E-waste, including computers, TVs, mobile phones, and other electronic devices, can be disassembled, and valuable components like metals and plastics can be recovered. This helps conserve resources and reduces the need for mining operations to extract these materials from the earth. 6. Textiles: Clothing, footwear, towels, bedding, and other textiles can be recycled and donated to charities or repurposed into insulation materials, rags, or industrial wipers. Recycling textiles prevents the waste of valuable resources required for the production of new textile materials. 7. Food and Garden Waste: Organic waste such as fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, grass clippings, leaves, and small branches can be composted and turned into nutrient-rich soil for use in gardening and agriculture, reducing the need for artificial fertilizers. 8. Batteries: Recycling rechargeable and single-use batteries can prevent harmful heavy metals from entering the environment. By recovering materials like nickel, cobalt, and lithium, recycling batteries reduces the need for mining these finite resources. 9. Tires: Automobile tires can be recycled into useful materials like rubber for playgrounds, artificial turf, rubber mulch, and shoe materials. Recycling tires helps save resources and reduce landfill space. 10. Cooking Oil: Used cooking oil can be processed into biodiesel or reused as industrial burners' fuel. Recycling cooking oil reduces the demand for new oil and contributes to a greener energy alternative. To effectively contribute to resource conservation, it is important to be aware of the recyclable materials in our waste and participate in local recycling programs. Furthermore, adopting practices like repairing damaged items, reducing single-use products, and purchasing items made from recycled materials can significantly enhance our resource conservation efforts."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, You are given an open-domain question that can be answered based on factual information.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. After the end of this story, the patient is probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - happy - sympathetic - excited - not enough information Answer:","output":"After hearing R's story about her experience with false advertising, the patient would likely feel sympathetic towards her. R was initially taken in by the promises of the \\"miracle shoe inserts,\\" only to find out they relied on a low-calorie diet for weight loss, which would have likely brought the same results without the inserts. The patient could understand R's disappointment and frustration at being deceived, and might admire her determination to help others avoid similar pitfalls by using her experiences as a lesson. This sympathetic response would encourage a deeper connection between the patient and R, and remind the patient of the importance of questioning the claims made by advertisers before investing time or money into their products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which state the particles would be farther, state B or state C?","output":"In the given scenario, state C represents the gaseous state of matter, while state B represents the liquid state of matter. The question asks in which state the particles would be farther apart – state B or state C. To answer this question, let's discuss the various properties and characteristics of liquid and gaseous states of matter. 1. Liquid State (State B): In the liquid state of matter, the particles are more tightly packed than in gases but not as much as in solids. They have some freedom to move or flow, but they are still in relatively close proximity to one another. This closeness of particles results in the cohesive forces that give liquids their ability to take the shape of their container and resistance to significant compression. Some major characteristics of a liquid state are: - Particles are close together but not as much as in solids - Particles have some freedom to move and flow - Moderate levels of intermolecular forces - Limited compressibility - Takes the shape of a container 2. Gaseous State (State C): In the gaseous state of matter, the particles have the most freedom to move and are spaced farthest apart compared to solids and liquids. The particles in gases have high kinetic energy, which allows them to move and spread out independently. This results in several unique characteristics of a gaseous state such as: - Particles are spaced far apart and have high kinetic energy - Particles have the most freedom to move - Weak intermolecular forces or no regular intermolecular interactions - Highly compressible - Expands to fill the volume of a container Given the characteristics and properties of the liquid state (state B) and gaseous state (state C) mentioned above, it becomes evident that in state C—the gaseous state—the particles would be farther apart than in state B, which is the liquid state."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There was so much to explain and to introduce. Slowly but surely, my mother caught on, making notes in a little notebook. After a few months of Scrabble and other games, I decided it was time to introduce her to word processing . This proved to be a bigger challenge  to her, so I gave her some homework.

Plot title: Case Closed: Strategy Above the Depths Movie plot: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogoro shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area. It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogoro, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more...

Options: a ) 7 , b ) 5 , c ) 9 , d ) 6 , e ) 4 Output:","output":"The task is asking you to solve a geometry problem related to surface areas of a rectangular cube (a.k.a. rectangular box) and a cube.  Guidelines:  1. First, you need to calculate the surface area of a rectangular cube (box). The surface area of a rectangular cube can be calculated by using the formula: 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the rectangular cube.       In this case, the length is 15 inches, the width is 12 inches, and the height is 2 inches. Plugging these values into the formula will give you the surface area of the rectangular cube. 2. The problem states that the surface area of the rectangle cube is the same as a cube. This means that the surface area of a cube is also the same value you calculated from the previous step. 3. The surface area of a cube is calculated by the formula: 6s^2, where s is the length of one side of the cube.  4. You will then need to set the previously calculated surface area equal to this formula (6s^2) and solve for 's'. 5. In the final step, you need to match the value of 's' with the nearest whole number from the provided options: a ) 7 , b ) 5 , c ) 9 , d ) 6 , e ) 4 That is your answer to the problem.  Let's put these steps into Implement. 1. Calculate the surface area of the rectangular cube (box):     2*15*12 + 2*15*2 + 2*12*2 = 660 square inches 2. Set this equal to 6s^2:     660 = 6s^2  3. Solve for 's':    s^2 = 660 / 6 = 110    s = √110 ≈ 10.48 4. The closest whole number to 10.48 from the options 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e' is 'c') 9.  So, the output will be 'c'.

Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline.

Pat has 2 acres of land with good soil structure and high infiltration capacity. This means that Pat's soil allows water to penetrate easily, facilitating better nutrient uptake by plants and promoting healthy crop growth. 2. Tim has a similarly sized land parcel, but his soil is very alkaline, with a high pH (> 8.5). This led Tim to amend the soil with aluminum salts to make it more acidic and suitable for crop cultivation. 3.

The cheat sheet will be posted for readers' inspection. Does it follow that \\"Readers will be allowed to read the cheat sheet.\\"?","output":"Yes, it does follow. I arrive at this conclusion based on the following thought process: 1. Understand the task: Here we need to interpret whether if a \\"cheat sheet\\" posted for inspection implies that the readers can read it.     2. Break down the components: The phrase \\"the cheat sheet will be posted for readers' inspection\\" entails two parts; the action of posting the cheat sheet and who it's intended for (the readers).     3. Interpret the phrase: \\"Posted for readers' inspection\\" suggests that the cheat sheet is being made publicly available for examination by a group called 'readers'.     4. Establish Link: 'Inspection' implies the act of examining or reviewing something, and in the context of a document or text such as a cheat sheet, it generally involves reading.     5. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that \\"Readers will be allowed to read the cheat sheet.\\" However, it should be noted that this does not unequivocally guarantee availability to all potential readers, only those who have access to where the cheat sheet is posted. The term 'allowed' refers to the permission to read, and since it is posted for the readers, the permission can be implicitly understood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: a lack  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"When analyzing the given sentence, \\"a lack,\\" as part of a movie review, it is crucial to understand the context, as the sentence is too short to immediately determine whether it is positive or negative. However, considering that the term \\"lack\\" generally refers to an insufficiency or absence, it can be inferred that this phrase is more likely negative. \\"Lack\\" suggests that there is something missing or not fully satisfying about the movie. However, without knowing the full context or the specific aspect of the movie that is lacking, it is impossible to provide a more concrete evaluation. For example, the phrase might be referring to a lack of character development, a weak storyline, inadequate visuals, or any number of other elements that make up a film's overall experience. To definitively label this phrase as negative or positive, more information and context is needed. Still, based on the word \\"lack,\\" it is reasonable to assume that the sentence leans more towards a negative connotation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Bernstein's back (And everybody is still wrong) -- Whatever happened to Richard Bernstein, Wall Street's favorite pessimist? He's an optimist now. The former chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch built a reputation as a contrarian throughout the 2000s, the era of cheap credit. As home prices soared, Bernstein saw a bubble and told investors to abandon homebuilding stocks. When subprime mortgages started to sour, he warned of the danger to banks. His skepticism earned him the ire of stock boosters. Bernstein was thought of as the guy ready to rain on any parade. The financial crisis changed all that. With investors now wary of stocks and market pundits looking for daily signs the sky is falling, Bernstein believes the conventional wisdom is wrong, again. The economy is stronger than you realize, he says. And the man who shunned stock markets is out telling people it's a great time to buy small-company stocks. \\"The common theme today is that the U.S. stinks,\\" he says. \\"But the economy is already in better shape than people think.\\" If you agree with Bernstein, you'll want to follow him into small companies that look cheap compared with their peers, a group investors call \\"small-cap value.\\" They're the most likely to trounce other investments if the economy recovers its footing, and also the most likely to fail in a downturn. If you think the economy stinks, you'd be in the company of his old friend David Rosenberg, the former chief U.S. economist at Merrill Lynch. It's only very recently that these two prominent investment analysts parted ways in their views about the economy. During their many years together at Merrill Lynch, both Rosenberg and Bernstein were steadfastly skeptical of the housing and stock booms. \\"We were joined at the hip,\\" says Rosenberg, who's now the chief economist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto. Both left Merrill Lynch soon after Bank of America Corp. took it over in 2009. Rosenberg, who remains reliably gloomy, says he's ready to turn positive on the economy whenever the time is right. With his friend and former colleague Bernstein now bullish on the U.S. economy, \\"I'm Wall Street's real perma-bear,\\" he deadpans. Unlike when he was the chief strategist at Merrill, Bernstein has money to put behind his contrarian views. The Richard Bernstein Multi-Market Equity Strategy Fund launched Oct. 12 with the backing of asset management company Eaton Vance. It's considered a \\"macro\\" fund. That means all investment decisions spring from Bernstein's overarching view of the world. Stocks are collected based on how well they fit into the big picture. The fund's billing says it will target \\"overlooked areas across the global equity markets.\\" That's no easy task as investors spent the past two years pulling cash out of the U.S. stock market and plowing it into areas long considered dicey, like emerging markets and junk bonds. At a recent conference, a financial planner asked Bernstein: What's overlooked these days? The answer, he said, is right under your nose: small-company U.S. stocks, specifically the undervalued ones. Bernstein says investors have shied away from them because their fate is so closely tied to the economic cycle. Most people aren't convinced the economy has regained its footing, which is why small companies have found it harder to get a loan from banks or raise capital from investors. Summary:","output":"Richard Bernstein, the former chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch and notable contrarian, shifted from being a pessimist on Wall Street to an optimist. He gained a reputation during the 2000s era of cheap credit for predicting issues in the housing and stock booms, which eventually led to the financial crisis. Currently, as investors express caution with stocks and market pundits focus on negative aspects, Bernstein argues that the economy is stronger than realized. He is now encouraging people to invest in small-company stocks, specifically small-cap value ones, stating that they are most likely to perform better than other investments if the economy recovers. With Bernstein's optimism, the Richard Bernstein Multi-Market Equity Strategy Fund was launched on October 12th, targeting overlooked global equity market areas, with a particular focus on undervalued small-company U.S. stocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to this the dead (called zombies) have arisen to eat the living. However a company has developed a collar that, when put around the zombies neck, makes them docile and perfect servants. The Robinsons mom Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), dad Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one. Tim names the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his dad hates him and Timmy looses control of Fido and things go wrong. As you can see this is--among many other things--a takeoff on the \\"Lassie\\" series with Fido being a stand in for Lassie. Timmy was named that for a reason! Every single of the famous Lassie episodes are spun here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido off to get help before the zombies eat him! Also it's a satire of those 1950s Douglas Sirk films where everything is bright and colorful--but dark secrets are tearing people apart. The characters wear VERY bright 1950s clothes (Moss is always in a dress)--the furnishings, settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitious there's always something to look at. The script is good--but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can make. The melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off. Everyone here is excellent and right on target. Even Connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job. Moss is the best--playing each line for all its worth---but never going overboard. This isn't for everybody (of course). The satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame. The gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it's hard to take it seriously. So, for some people, this will really work. I give it an 8.

The neighborhood known as the \\"Inlet\\" became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's decline were multi-layered. First of all, the automobile became more readily available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks. Also, the advent of suburbia played a huge role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer. But perhaps the biggest factor in the decline in Atlantic City's popularity came from cheap, fast jet service to other premier resorts, such as Miami Beach and the Bahamas. After the war, what form of transportation became more readily available to many Americans?","output":"After World War II, the automobile became more readily available to many Americans. This increased accessibility played a significant role in changing travel habits, as people no longer had to rely on trains for transportation. They could now use their personal cars to visit destinations like Atlantic City more easily and flexibly, altering the dynamics of tourism and contributing to the decline of the resort city in the mid-to-late 20th century. The ability to drive allowed travelers to come and go as they pleased, often opting for shorter stays rather than the previously popular weeks-long vacations.

Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says many of the 5,000 students who paid up to 35,000 thought they would at least meet Trump but instead all they got was their picture taken in front of a life-size picture of \\"The Apprentice\\" TV star.      \\"Trump University engaged in deception at every stage of consumers' advancement through costly programs and caused real financial harm,\\" Schneiderman said. \\"Trump University, with Donald Trump's knowledge and participation, relied on Trump's name recognition and celebrity status to take advantage of consumers who believed in the Trump brand.\\"      But Trump's attorney accused Schneiderman of trying to extort campaign contributions from the real estate mogul through his investigation of Trump. Attorney Michael D. Cohen told The Associated Press on Saturday that Schneiderman's lawsuit was filled with falsehoods. Cohen said Trump and his university never defrauded anyone.      He said Trump University provided nearly 11,000 testimonials to Schneiderman from students praising the program and said 98 percent of students in a survey termed the program \\"excellent.\\"      \\"The attorney general has been angry because he felt that Mr. Trump and his various companies should have done much more for him in terms of fundraising,\\" Cohen said. \\"This entire investigation is politically motivated and it is a tremendous waste of taxpayers' money.\\"      State Board of Elections records show Trump has spent more than 136,000 on New York campaigns since 2010. He contributed 12,500 to Schneiderman in October 2010, when Schneiderman was running for attorney general, records show. An outspoken conservative, Trump himself flirted with a presidential run last year.      \\"Donald Trump will not sit back and be extorted by anyone, including the attorney general,\\" Cohen said.      The lawsuit says many of the wannabe moguls were unable to land even one real estate deal and were left far worse off than before the lessons, facing thousands of dollars in debt for the seminar program once billed as a top quality university with Trump's \\"hand-picked\\" instructors.      Schneiderman is suing the program, Trump as the university chairman, and the former president of the university in a case to be handled in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. He accuses them of engaging in persistent fraud, illegal and deceptive conduct and violating federal consumer protection law. The 40 million he seeks is mostly to pay restitution to consumers.      He dismissed Trump's claim of a political motive.      \\"The fact that he's still brave enough to follow the investigation wherever it may lead speaks to Mr. Schneiderman's character,\\" Schneiderman spokesman Andrew Friedman told AP.      State Education Department officials had told Trump to change the name of his enterprise years ago, saying it lacked a license and didn't meet the legal definitions of a university. In 2011 it was renamed the Trump Entrepreneur Institute, but it has been dogged since by complaints from consumers and a few isolated civil lawsuits claiming it didn't fulfill its advertised claims.      Schneiderman's lawsuit covers complaints dating to 2005 through 2011. Students paid between 1,495 and 35,000 to learn from the Manhattan mogul who wrote the best seller, \\"Art of the Deal\\" a decade ago followed by \\"How to Get Rich\\" and \\"Think Like a Billionaire.\\"      Scheiderman said the three-day seminars didn't, as promised, teach consumers everything they needed to know about real estate. The Trump University manual tells instructors not to let consumers \\"think three days will be enough to make them successful,\\" Schneiderman said.      At the seminars, consumers were told about \\"Trump Elite\\" mentorships that cost 10,000 to 35,000. Students were promised individual instruction until they made their first deal. Schneiderman said participants were urged to extend the limit on their credit cards for real estate deals, but then used the credit to pay for the Trump Elite programs. The attorney general said the program also failed to promptly cancel memberships as promised.      ___      Consumers may file complaints at:      http://www.ag.ny.gov/bureaus/consumer_frauds/filing_a_consumer_complaint.html. ||||| 4 years ago      (CNN) – New York's attorney general accused Donald Trump in a lawsuit Saturday of defrauding students who studied at the billionaire mogul's investment institute, though Trump's representative said a large majority of the school's alumni were satisfied with their experience.      The 40 million civil suit alleges Trump made false claims about the school, including that he was personally involved in selecting instructors and creating the curriculum.            Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said Trump had crafted a \\"bait and switch\\" with his school, using his well-known name.      \\"Trading on his celebrity status, Mr. Trump personally appeared in advertisements making false promises to convince people to spend tens of thousands of dollars they couldn't afford for lessons they never got,\\" he wrote in a statement. \\"No one, no matter how rich or famous they are, has a right to scam hard working New Yorkers. Anyone who does should expect to be held accountable.\\"      The suit names both Trump, the chairman of the school, and Michael Sexton, its former president, as defendants. Schneiderman is seeking 40 million to repay customers who have enrolled in the school, as well as additional penalties and fines.      On Twitter, Trump called Schneiderman a \\"lightweight\\" and said the attorney general was \\"trying to extort me with a civil law suit.\\"      He also linked to a website that claims 98% of Trump University's former students were satisfied with their experience.      Michael Cohen, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and a lawyer for the billionaire, said the suit \\"has no merit and is nothing more than a cheap publicity stunt to deflect from (Schneiderman's) weak job performance.\\"      \\"I am shocked he didn't leak it to the Kris Kardashian show,\\" Cohen continued. \\"Maybe his office should focus more of their attention and the use of our tax dollars on bringing to justice those responsible for the financial meltdown.\\"      Cohen also pointed to the website citing an approval rating of 98% for the Trump investing classes, saying the figure was derived from questionnaires submitted by students upon completing the course of study. He said the website was created in anticipation of the lawsuit.      Trump University became the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010 after the New York State Education Department said the company could not use the term \\"university\\" without its consent. In 2011, the attorney general began investigating it, along with several other for-profit educational institutions.      Former students in California have also sued Trump's school, saying its advertising misled them into spending thousands of dollars on workshops and \\"mentorships.\\" In a class-action suit filed in 2010, the former students say Trump University is \\"like an infomercial\\" that lures customers with the Trump name but fails to deliver on its promises of success in real estate.      The Trump school offered courses in real estate, asset management, entrepreneurship and wealth creation. The courses ranged in price from 1,495 for a three-day workshop to 34,995 for a \\"full education.\\"      Unlike other for-profit schools, Trump's outfit relies heavily on the brand of its namesake.      Trump made his money by investing in New York real estate, casinos and golf courses around the world. But he is perhaps best known in popular culture for his long-running reality television show, \\"The Apprentice.\\"      More recently, Trump made headlines for suggesting that President Barack Obama is not a U.S. citizen, part of Trump's public mulling of a presidential bid. He eventually declined to run for the White House.      CNNMoney's Ben Rooney contributed to this report. |||||","output":"New York's attorney general sued Donald Trump for 40 million, accusing him of running a fraudulent \\"Trump University\\" that steered students into expensive seminars but failed to deliver promised apprenticeships.

Problem:Paragraph: Several serological interrelationships between various members of the coronavirus group have been revealed in neutralization, complement fixation, and geldiffusion tests, using human and hyperimmune animal sera. Several members of this group of human and animal pathogens are shown to cross-react in one or more type of test, but one member, avian infectious bronchitis virus, was shown to be unrelated. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHVs) was found to be antigenieally related to a number of human types of coronavirus. Difficulties were encountered in the investigation of paired human sera in demonstrating the specificity of antibody rises, placing doubt on the values of some serological studies. The significance of these interrelationships is discussed in the light of other investigations. BRADBURNE : Antigenic Relationships amongst Coronaviruses 353 organ cultures of human embryo nasal and tracheal epithelium. These isolates comprise at least three, and probably more, distinct serological types as judged by neutralization tests using convalescent human sera (B~A]) BUR~ and T~R~IiL, 1969; McI~Tos~ et al., 1969). This work describes the detection of several serological relationships between the viruses isolated from man, and those of mouse hepatitis and avian infectious bronchitis. The majority of these results were obtained before similar studies were reported by MCINTos~ et al. (1969); furthermore, different reagents were used and several extra cross-reactions were detected. 2.1. Tissue Cultures These were all propagated in this laboratory. Roller tube neutralization tests were performed in monolayer cultures of human embryo diploid lung cells (HDCS). These were either a strain derived at the Unit, or the WI-38 cell strain. Plaque neutralization tests were made using monolayers of L 132 cells in 50 mm plastic Pctri dishes (Sterilin). The L 132 cell line is a continuous epitheloid cell line which was derived from human embryo lung (DAvis, 1960) and has been shown to be sensitive to several respiratory viruses, including 4 strains of coronaviruses (BRAD-]~Vl~N]~, 1969). All cultures were maintained at 33~ after inoculation.   Title: Antigenic Relationships amongst Coronaviruses Solution:","output":"True The paragraph discusses the serological relationships between various members of the coronavirus group, specifically mentioning studies on antigenic relationships and cross-reactivity in different tests. The title \\"Antigenic Relationships amongst Coronaviruses\\" is suitable for this paragraph as it accurately reflects the content of the paragraph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite the initial shock and fear, they form a reluctant partnership in order to ensure their mutual survival. With a newly awakened determination, Shinichi decides to track down and fight off other alien parasites that have invaded Earth, all the while receiving assistance from the resourceful Migi. As Shinichi continues to hunt down these parasitic beings, Tamiya, a mysterious and intelligent woman with her own hidden agenda, urges him to stop getting involved. She recognizes Shinichi and Migi's unique bond and believes they pose a significant threat to the parasites. To help him avoid any unnecessary danger, she warns him to stay out of the conflict for the sake of his own safety. However, her efforts to help only strengthen Shinichi's resolve, as he realizes that he cannot simply sit back and allow these parasites to wreak havoc on humanity. Meanwhile, Kuramori, an experienced detective previously contracted by Tamiya to investigate the parasites, is consumed with anger following the death of his family at the creatures' hands. Despite Tamiya and Shinichi's attempts to reason with him and convince him to stay out of their unseen war, Kuramori is relentless in his pursuit of vengeance. Tragically, his determination ultimately proves to be his undoing, as he meets a grisly end at Tamiya's hands during a tense confrontation. With Kuramori's demise, Shinichi and Migi turn their attention to Hirokawa, an enigmatic figure who serves as the parasites' de facto leader. Assuming that he is a dangerous parasite like his accomplices, they carefully strategize a plan to eliminate this major threat. However, in a shocking twist, it is revealed that Hirokawa himself is actually human. His allegiance to the parasites stems from a twisted belief that they are a vital force of nature, existing to control the overpopulation of the human species. Despite the unexpected revelation, Shinichi and Migi's fight is far from over. They suddenly find themselves faced with the remaining parasite, whose power surpasses anything they've faced before. It becomes evident that this opponent may prove to be too formidable for their duo to confront alone. Desperate and determined, they team up with Tamiya, joining forces to face their shared enemy. As the diverse group comes together to face this daunting challenge, they are forced to address their differences and question the blurry line between friend and enemy. Each member of the team must confront their personal motivations and fears, as they devise a strategy to defeat this overwhelming adversary. The ensuing battle is a grueling test of their combined strength, cunning, and bond. Ultimately, the fate of the world, as well as the fate of their own lives, depends on the success of their alliance. In the face of such a powerful entity, the unlikely alliance must stand strong, pushing themselves to their mental, moral, and physical limits in the hope to protect Earth and humanity. The seemingly insurmountable challenge is a turning point for Shinichi and Migi, as they are forced to reflect upon their relationship with other humans and parasites alike. Despite the bleak reality they're confronted with, the two find solace in their partnership and better understand their role in this ongoing struggle between their two very different worlds."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.42. How many percent of the households were not classified as non-family households?","output":"Based on the context, 42.0% of the households were classified as non-family households. To find the percentage of households that were not classified as non-family households, we need to subtract this percentage from 100%. 100% - 42.0% = 58.0% So, 58.0% of the households were not classified as non-family households. This means that these households were formed by families, whether they were comprised of married couples with or without children, single-parent families, or any other family composition that does not fit the category of non-family households.  It is essential to note that the given statistics provide a snapshot of the household composition at the time of the 2010 census, and these percentages may have changed over time with demographic shifts, societal changes, and other factors influencing the structure and characteristics of households.

These days are set aside to show love and respect for parents. They raise their children and educate them to be responsible citizens. They give love and care. These two days make us think about the changing roles of mothers and fathers. More mothers now work outside the home. More fathers must help with child care. These two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead. Many people attend religious services to honor parents. It is also a day when people whose parents are dead visit the cemetery .On these days families get together at home, as well as in restaurants. They often have outdoor barbecues for Father's Day. These are days of fun and good feelings and memories. Another tradition is to give cards and gifts. Children make them in school. Many people make their own presents. These are valued more than the ones bought in stores. It is not the value of the gift that is important, but it is \\"the thought that counts\\".

Step 1: Assess the situation Using a condom or contraceptives (such as birth control pills, an intrauterine device, or a  contraceptive patch) helps to prevent unwanted pregnancies by creating barriers between sperm and an egg. Step 2: Consider the advantage of the chosen method Option 2 is more reliable than option 1, as \\"Plan B\\" pills are meant to be used as an emergency contraceptive and not as a regular method of birth control. Using a condom or contraceptive also has the added benefit of potentially protecting against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Step 3: Acquire the necessary contraceptive method Purchase condoms or obtain contraceptives by consulting with a healthcare provider to determine the most suitable contraceptive method for you and your partner's specific needs. Step 4: Use the contraceptive method correctly Follow the instructions for using the chosen contraceptive method. For condoms, ensure that they are used correctly, meaning they are placed on the penis properly and not expired. For contraceptives, follow the healthcare provider's instructions on when and how to use them. Step 5: Engage in safe sex practices Consistently use the chosen contraceptive method during each sexual encounter and continue to engage in open communication with your partner about safe sex practices. In summary, by choosing option 2, we would prevent unwanted pregnancies by consistently and correctly using condoms or contraceptives before engaging in sex.

Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters. Dot-matrix displays typically use 5x7 pixels per character. Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of liquid crystal displays, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"In the given context, it is the seven-segment LED displays that are being replaced. The rising popularity and use of alternative display technologies, such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs), have contributed to the decline in the popularity and usage of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays. Seven-segment LED displays, which were prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s, have several limitations compared to the newer display technologies available today. These include a limited ability to handle characters (they can display all numbers and a limited set of letters) and higher power consumption compared to alternatives like LCDs. On the other hand, liquid crystal displays offer lower power needs, greater display flexibility, and a wider range of characters. This makes them a more attractive option for many applications, gradually replacing the older seven-segment LED displays in various devices and setups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen.  - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event.  - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing.  - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.  - Tsugiharu Ogiwara (   Ogiwara Tsugiharu ) ( born 20 December 1969 ) is a Japanese nordic combined skier who competed from 1994 to 1998 . He won the 4 x 5 km team event at the 1995 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Thunder Bay , Ontario . Ogiwara 's best individual finish at the Winter Olympics was 6th at Nagano in 1998 . He had two individual career victories ( 1993 : 15 km individual , 1998 : 7.5 km sprint ) . He is the twin brother of Kenji Ogiwara , a fellow Japanese Nordic combined athlete .  - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility.

In general, the sentiment can be seen as positive, neutral, or somewhat mixed, based on the below interpretations: 1. Positive sentiment: In this perception, the sentence may be seen as a compliment towards a documentary that is concise, well-researched, and straight to the point. The choice of words \\"sharp\\" and \\"quick\\" could be seen as a high-quality production that effectively presents information in a timely manner. The audience appreciates the documentary for its clear focus and precise delivery of information, which adds value and credibility to the presentation. 2. Neutral sentiment: In this perception, the phrase \\"sharp and quick documentary\\" may be interpreted as a factual statement without any emotional connotation. The sentence simply conveys the idea that the documentary is brief and to the point, without implying any appreciation or criticism. The reader acknowledges the characteristics of the documentary, without expressing any explicit feeling or preference. 3. Somewhat mixed sentiment: There can be a mixed perception where the sentence can be viewed in a slightly different light. While \\"sharp\\" is generally seen as a positive attribute, the word \\"quick\\" may also be interpreted as a documentary that covers its topics hastily, potentially leading to incomplete information or analysis. In this context, the sentence might suggest that the documentary is well-produced and insightful, but the brevity of the production may not allow for an exhaustive exploration of its subject matter. This interpretation may leave the viewer feeling both appreciative of the documentary's efficiency and focus, while desiring a more comprehensive examination of its content. In summary, the sentiment of the sentence \\"sharp and quick documentary\\" can be perceived differently based on the reader's perspective and expectations. It can be either positive, neutral, or somewhat mixed, with variations in feelings of appreciation, acknowledgement, and desire for a more in-depth analysis. To fully determine the sentiment of the sentence, it would be crucial to consider the context in which the phrase is used and the intentions of the speaker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

Aggrieved by his treatment and claiming the dog was stolen from him, Hazel leads several of his friends to Johnson's isolated cabin. Some begin shooting while others create a diversion. After the shooting of Sitka, the dog that Johnson has nursed back to health, the trapper kills one pursuer, Jimmy Tom (Denis Lacroix), Once they discover that Johnson has bought 700 rounds of ammunition from the local trading post and paid in 100 bills, many conclude that he is the \\"mad trapper\\", a possibly mythical, psychopathic, serial killer who supposedly murders other trappers in the wilderness and takes their gold teeth.

Answering each option in detail: - Church: A church is a place of worship, and it is not a suitable place to hold company meetings unless it is related to the religious organization operating within the church. It may not provide the professional atmosphere required for a business meeting. - Office building: An office building houses various office spaces and is generally dedicated to business activities.

I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market.

Nasser recognized the new government and stated that \\"any attack on Iraq was tantamount to an attack on the UAR\\".

Answer the following question: Information:  - The Territory of Papua and New Guinea was established by an administrative union between the Australian-administered territories of Papua and New Guinea in 1949. In 1972, the name of the Territory changed to \\"Papua New Guinea\\" and in 1975 it became the independent nation of Papua New Guinea.  - Pomerania is a region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland.  - The Battle of Cape Gloucester was a battle in the Pacific theater of World War II between Japanese and Allied forces which took place on the island of New Britain , Territory of New Guinea , between late December 1943 and April 1944 . The battle was a major part of Operation Cartwheel , the main Allied strategy in the South West Pacific Area and Pacific Ocean Areas during 1943 -- 44 , and was the second World War II landing of the U.S. 1st Marine Division , after Guadalcanal .  - The Territory of New Guinea was an Australian administered territory on the island of New Guinea from 1920 until 1975. In 1949, the Territory and the Territory of Papua were established in an administrative union by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. That administrative union was renamed as Papua New Guinea in 1971. Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of New Guinea at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.  - Rabaul is a township in East New Britain province, on the island of New Britain, in the country of Papua New Guinea. New Britain is an island about 60 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash of a volcanic eruption.  - New Britain, is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago (named after Otto von Bismarck) of Papua New Guinea. It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George's Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan. While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern (\\"New Pomerania\\").  - Kimbe is the capital of the province of West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. It is a port town on the great Kimbe Bay which boasts more than 60 percent of the coral species of the entire Indo-Pacific. The bustling town of Kimbe is the third largest port in Papua New Guinea and is the fastest growing city in the South Pacific. Accommodation in Kimbe is readily available in many high-class resorts and hotels, as well as many budget guesthouses and motels dribbled along the province. The town of Kimbe is served by Hoskins Airport.  - Vitiaz Strait is a strait between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, northern New Guinea.   - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - German New Guinea was the first part of the German colonial empire. It was a protectorate from 1884 until 1914 when it fell to Australian forces following the outbreak of the First World War. It consisted of the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The mainland part of German New Guinea and the nearby islands of the Bismarck Archipelago and the North Solomon Islands are now part of Papua New Guinea. The Micronesian islands of German New Guinea are now governed as the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau.  - Operation Cartwheel (19431944) was a major military strategy for the Allies in the Pacific theater of World War II. Cartwheel was a twin-axis of advance operation, aimed at militarily neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA)General Douglas MacArthurwhose forces advanced along the northeast coast of New Guinea and occupied nearby islands. Allied forces from the Pacific Ocean Areas commandunder Admiral Chester W. Nimitzadvanced through the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville. The Allied forces involved were from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the US and various Pacific Islands.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - Cape Gloucester (also known as Tuluvu) is a headland on the northern side of the far west of the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese captured New Britain, and had driven most of Cape Gloucester's native population out to construct two airfields. During the New Britain Campaign, American forces had decided to capture Cape Gloucester for its two airfields, to assist planned attacks on the garrison on Rabaul, an important area in New Britain. It became the site of the Battle of Cape Gloucester, part of Operation Cartwheel, in 1943. After long fighting through rain, and Japanese, the United States 1st Marine Division had it declared secured. After the war, the headland was given back to the natives.  - Papua New Guinea (PNG  Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815  30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, significantly and deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \\"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers.\\"  - The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about 50,000 square km.  - Kokopo is the capital of East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. The capital was moved from Rabaul in 1994 when the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted. As a result, the population of the town increased more than sixfold from 3,150 in 1990 to 20,262 in 2000.  - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.  - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region.  - The Territory of Papua comprised the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea from 1883 to 1975. In 1883, the Government of Queensland annexed this territory for the British Empire. The United Kingdom Government refused to ratify the annexation but in 1884 a Protectorate was proclaimed over the territory, then called \\"British New Guinea\\". There is a certain ambiguity about the exact date on which the entire territory was annexed by the British. The Papua Act 1905 recites that this happened \\"on or about\\" 4 September 1888. On 18 March 1902, the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, who accepted the territory under the name of Papua.

How does the sentence end? See options at the end Jennifer tended to overthink every decision but Laura was more spur of the moment.  OPTIONS: A). Jennifer missed out on a lot of things. B). Laura missed out on a lot of things.","output":"Jennifer tended to overthink every decision but Laura was more spur of the moment. Jennifer missed out on a lot of things.  Both Jennifer and Laura's approaches to making decisions had their own pros and cons. Jennifer's overthinking nature made her cautious and risk-averse, which could sometimes protect her from making hasty mistakes or jumping into situations that she might later regret. Her analytical nature most likely stemmed from past experiences or lessons she had learned from others. Jennifer likely believed that by being prudent, she would have better control over her life and could avoid potential pitfalls. However, there was a downside to Jennifer's overthinking. The constant analysis of every decision made it difficult for her to act quickly and take advantage of certain opportunities. She would often find herself paralyzed by indecision in time-sensitive situations, or she would miss out on exciting experiences because she was too concerned about potential negative outcomes. Moreover, this approach may have limited her personal and professional growth as she rarely stepped out of her comfort zone. On the other hand, Laura's spontaneity and \\"spur of the moment\\" decision-making style offered her many benefits. She was more open to embracing new experiences and taking risks, which could lead to exciting adventures and discoveries. Laura was often more comfortable making snap decisions, trusting her instincts and intuition. This approach allowed her to seize opportunities that presented themselves unexpectedly and adapt to changing circumstances with relative ease. Nevertheless, Laura's impulsivity also had its drawbacks. Her quickness to act without thoroughly considering consequences occasionally led her into trouble, whether it be making impulsive purchases or making decisions that later proved to be unwise. Additionally, while her spontaneity might give her a sense of excitement and adventure, it could also be tiring or overwhelming for those around her, as they struggled to keep up with her constantly changing plans and desires. In the end, Jennifer's overthinking tendencies meant she missed out on many opportunities that Laura, with her more spontaneous nature, could embrace wholeheartedly. Yet, it is essential to recognize that both approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses. Embracing a balance between the two, with thoughtful analysis coupled with a willingness to take calculated risks, may lead to a more fulfilling life and allow individuals like Jennifer and Laura to navigate decisions and seize opportunities with confidence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Now, I have a new situation: Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture.  Answer this question please: Which farm causes more algae to grow out of control? A:","output":"Between the two farms - Bold farm and Shallow farm - it is clear that Bold farm, which has used lots of fertilizers over the years, contributes to the growth of algae more significantly than Shallow farm, which has implemented organic methods combined with those from permaculture.  Let's analyze some of the underlying mechanisms involved. First, Bold farm has been consistently applying substantial amounts of fertilizer. These fertilizers are typically rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, which enhance plant growth and increase agricultural yields. However, when rain falls on the land, it dissolves these fertilizers in the soil. As water flows over the soil surface, it creates runoff carrying dissolved fertilizers from the cultivated land and ultimately enters the nearby water sources. This excessive nutrient discharge contributes to the buildup of nutritional richness in bodies of water, such as ponds and oceans. In particular, the presence of nitrogen in these water bodies encourages the growth of phytoplankton, algae, and other aquatic plants at an uncontrolled rate. This phenomenon is known as eutrophication, which can lead to harmful algal blooms - an environmental hazard characterized by the overgrowth of harmful algae within water bodies. Algal blooms consume the available dissolved carbon dioxide in the water and produce oxygen via photosynthesis during the daytime. As these algal blooms eventually die out, however, decomposers thrive and begin breaking down the dead algal matter. This process of decomposition consumes substantial amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water, leading to hypoxia, or depleted oxygen levels. As a result, the affected area becomes a dead zone, which is devoid of aquatic life, primarily due to low oxygen levels. In contrast, Shallow farm adopts more sustainable and environmentally-friendly agricultural practices, such as organic farming and permaculture. Organic farming avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers, opting instead for natural alternatives like compost, cover crops, and green manure to supply essential nutrients to plants. Integrating permaculture principles, the farm focuses on designing agricultural systems that are both productive and regenerative, working in harmony with natural ecosystems. By employing these eco-conscious practices, Shallow farm minimizes its impact on the environment and surrounding water bodies. Consequently, Shallow farm is less likely to cause harmful algal blooms or contribute to the creation of dead zones in nearby aquatic ecosystems. In conclusion, Bold farm, with its excessive use of fertilizers, causes more algae to grow out of control when compared to Shallow farm, which implements organic and permaculture methods. This comparison emphasizes the importance of sustainable agriculture in mitigating environmental degradation and curbing the detrimental impacts of eutrophication on aquatic ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: May 8 (Bloomberg) -- Patti Hart, the Yahoo director responsible for the vetting process in the hiring of Chief Executive Officer Scott Thompson, will not stand for re-election to the board at the company's next annual meeting. Bloomberg's Cory Johnson reports on Bloomberg Television's \\"Money Moves.\\" (Source: Bloomberg)      Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) board members met yesterday to review the academic record of Chief Executive Officer Scott Thompson, a person briefed on the plans said, as investor Third Point LLC stepped up pressure for his ouster.      The company formed a committee of three recently appointed board members to explore discrepancies in Thompson’s resume, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the meetings are private. An outside law firm is working with the committee, this person said.      Third Point, which is trying to win seats on Yahoo’s board and has said the company is mismanaged, last week highlighted errors in Thompson’s resume and demanded that he be fired. The fallout marks a setback for Thompson, who had just embarked on efforts to revive growth and help the company do a better job coping with challenges in online advertising and social media from Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. Yahoo’s board fired former CEO Carol Bartz in September amid falling sales.      The biography for Thompson, who joined Yahoo from EBay Inc. (EBAY) in January, listed a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Stonehill College, a credential that wasn’t offered until four years after he graduated, Third Point CEO Daniel Loeb said.      Yahoo’s board said last week that it would review the matter and “make an appropriate disclosure to shareholders.” The company had earlier called the discrepancy an “inadvertent error” and said it “in no way alters that fact that Mr. Thompson is a highly qualified executive with a successful track record leading large consumer technology companies.”      Thompson’s Apology      Thompson, in a memo to staff yesterday, apologized for the fallout from the disclosures and said he takes “full responsibility.” He said he’s cooperating with the review.      “I want you to know how deeply I regret how this issue has affected the company and all of you,” Thompson said. “We have all been working very hard to move the company forward, and this has had the opposite effect.”      Dana Lengkeek, spokeswoman for Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo, declined to comment.      Yahoo shares slid 1.5 percent to 15.11 as of 10:57 a.m. in New York. They had lost 4.8 percent this year before today.      New York-based Third Point demanded yesterday that it be able to inspect records related to Thompson’s hiring, as well as the appointment of director Patti Hart, whose credentials it also questions.      “Yahoo shareholders and employees will be best served if the board accepts responsibility quickly for this latest debacle,” Third Point said in a letter. “If the directors are truly interested in ‘working in a constructive manner with Third Point,’ they should provide answers promptly.”      Thompson has cut 2,000 jobs and overhauled management. The company’s shares had their biggest rally in almost four months on April 18 after Yahoo reported first-quarter sales that topped estimates, fueling optimism that turnaround efforts may take hold. A day earlier, Yahoo reported its first revenue gain in more than three years.

Patti Hart — the Yahoo director in charge of the search that resulted in the hiring of Scott Thompson as its CEO, making her directly responsible for a clearly botched vetting of his academic record — will not stand for re-election to the board at the next annual meeting, according to sources close to the situation.      Hart — who is CEO of International Game Technology, which makes electronic gaming equipment and systems products — is resigning. Apparently, said sources, her own board asked her to remove herself from the Yahoo mess to better focus on the company she actually runs.      But she is perhaps just a few steps ahead of being pushed, given her key role in the hiring of Thompson, who was president of eBay’s PayPal payments unit when he cold-emailed Yahoo director and Intuit CEO Brad Smith seeking the job.      A Yahoo spokesman declined to comment.      [UPDATE: Yahoo confirmed the inevitable departure later in the day and said the Yahoo board would have nine members going forward. Hart also released a statement, confirming the move.]      Hart, who came to the Yahoo board in 2010, has been head of its corporate governance and nominating committee.      The departure makes her the first casualty — but definitely not the last — of the controversy over how a fake college degree managed to get in Yahoo’s regulatory filings via Thompson’s inaccurate bio.      The issues around how Thompson was hired — including how background checks on him failed to discover that he never got a CS degree from the Boston area’s Stonehill College, as his longtime bio on eBay had claimed — are part of a new investigation by the board.      That will be officially announced later today, along with the hiring of an outside law firm to conduct the probe, which will be headed by independent director Fred Amoroso.      [UPDATE: Yahoo officially said it was forming a special committee to look at Thompson’s bio snafu and the circumstances around his hiring. Along with Amoroso, the other members are John Hayes and Thomas McInerney, independent directors who joined the board in April.      “The special committee and the entire Board appreciate the urgency of the situation and the special committee will therefore conduct the review in an independent, thorough and expeditious manner,” a statement from Yahoo said.      Interestingly, the statement did not include a show of support for Thompson, which often happens in such circumstances.]      They will have a lot to investigate. Such as this mystery: Thompson’s correct bio appeared in filings eBay made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, while Yahoo’s similar documents were inaccurate about his educational credentials.      Also under scrutiny: How the falsehood was added to Thompson’s public resume, and who put it there; why Thompson never noticed the error, there since at least 2004; why he declined to correct it when asked directly about it; and who at Yahoo might have known about the problem before the hiring.      It’s a basic case of who, what, where, when and how. And, most of all, why anyone would make such a dumb mistake.      Hart would seem to have all the answers to that, along with a forensic firm that worked on the vetting. Key Yahoo staffers were also involved, said sources, although its headhunting firm on the CEO search, Heidrick & Struggles, was not used in relation to Thompson.      Presumably, there is a paper trail of some sort, which was the subject of a legal demand by activist shareholder Daniel Loeb of Third Point yesterday. He uncovered the bio error last week, in the middle of pressing a proxy fight to garner board seats.      Loeb’s allegations also nailed Hart in much-less-egregious padding of her own college record, making it appear as if she had economics and marketing degrees. She has one in business administration, with “specialties” (Yahoo’s ridonkulous word, not mine) in economics and marketing.      While Hart’s leaving might assuage some, providing a convenient scapegoat to the bizarre situation, this is by no means over for Yahoo or Thompson.      Another increasingly potent issue is the ever-declining morale at the Silicon Valley Internet giant over the company’s odd response — it initially called the bio problem an “inadvertent error,” without further explanation — and also Thompson’s lack of transparency on the issue.      He released an email to employees last night, apologizing for the “distraction” of the resume issue, but not for the error itself.      That, and other of Thompson’s actions — he has been described to me, by many close to the situation, as defiant over the issue, and as blaming Loeb for conducting a personal vendetta — did not sit well with many, both inside and outside Yahoo.      A Yahoo spokeswoman told me earlier this week that there is much support for Thompson internally and externally, but declined to provide specifics.      But message boards I read were mostly negative about him, as are a plethora of direct emails to me on the situation. One clever commenter on this site bemoaned that Thompson might get off “Scott-free.”      Ouch! Nonetheless, the atmosphere at Yahoo is indeed unsettled.      “Sentiment from employees is unanimous that he must go,” said a Yahoo employee, who has no personal agenda that I can grok, in a common refrain. “He clearly knew and lied for years; and his handling since exposed has been unacceptable.”      Unacceptable or not, though, Hart is the only one going for now. But stay tuned.      Until then, here’s an appearance I made today on WSJ.com to talk about Hart’s departure: |||||Summary:","output":"Yahoo's board has formed a committee to investigate the discrepancies in CEO Scott Thompson's resume, as investor Third Point LLC calls for his removal. Thompson's resume inaccurately listed a Bachelor's degree in computer science from Stonehill College that he never received. Yahoo had initially called the discrepancy an \\"inadvertent error\\" but is now facing pressure from shareholders and declining company morale.

While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.  Question: \\"What kind of deposits build up in caves as water continues to drip?\\" Answer: \\"Oil deposits\\" Is this answer correct?  I. no. II. yes....I think the answer is","output":"I. no. The answer \\"Oil deposits\\" is incorrect because the deposits that build up in caves as water continues to drip are not oil. Instead, they are called stalactites and stalagmites, which are mineral deposits formed by the dripping of water in caves. Oil deposits are formed from the remains of dead plants and animals that are subjected to heat and pressure over millions of years, not from dripping water in caves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The BPI (British Recorded Music Industry) Limited, commonly known as the British Phonographic Industry or BPI, is the British recorded music industry's trade association.  Its membership comprises hundreds of music companies including all three \\"major\\" record companies in the UK (Warner Music UK, Sony Music Entertainment, and Universal Music Group), and hundreds of independent music labels and small to medium-sized music businesses.  It has represented the interests of British record companies since being formally incorporated in 1973 when the principal aim was to promote British music and fight copyright infringement.  In 2007, the association's legal name was changed from British Phonographic Industry Limited (The).  It founded the annual BRIT Awards for the British music industry in 1977, and, later, The Classic BRIT Awards. The organizing company, BRIT Awards Limited, is a fully owned subsidiary of the BPI. Proceeds from both shows go to the BRIT Trust, the charitable arm of the BPI that has donated almost £15m to charitable causes nationwide since its foundation in 1989. In September 2013, the BPI presented the first ever BRITs Icon Award to Sir Elton John. The BPI also endorsed the launch of the Mercury Prize for the Album of the Year in 1992.  The recorded music industry's Certified Awards program, which attributes Platinum, Gold and Silver status to singles, albums and music videos (Platinum and Gold only) based on their sales performance (see BPI Certified Awards program), has been administered by the BPI since its inception in 1973.

According to CBS Marketwatch, Harley-Davidson Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Bleustein said today that he will hand over chief-executive duties to CFO James Ziemer on April 30, 2005. What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a leadership transition taking place within the Harley-Davidson company. Jeffrey Bleustein, the then Chairman and CEO of Harley-Davidson, announced that he would be stepping down from his role as the Chief Executive Officer. He stated that he would be handing over his chief-executive duties to James Ziemer, who was serving as the company's Chief Financial Officer at that time. This transition was scheduled to occur on April 30, 2005. This leadership change indicates a significant shift within the organization, as the CEO is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations, implementing strategic decisions, and ensuring the success and growth of the company. The announcement of this change in management would likely be a matter of interest to investors, stakeholders, employees, and fans of the motorcycle brand, as it could potentially impact the company's future direction, financial performance, and overall stability. It is not uncommon for major corporations to undergo changes in leadership, as it can introduce fresh perspectives and ideas that can help drive innovation and growth within the business. However, it is crucial for companies to carefully manage and communicate these transitions to ensure a smooth handover of responsibilities and maintain confidence in the company's leadership. In this particular case, the announcement communicates that the decision was likely made by mutual agreement, with Bleustein remaining in his role as Chairman. This could suggest a continued close relationship between the outgoing and incoming CEOs, and possibly signal that the change may not necessarily lead to dramatic shifts in the company's vision or strategy. The fact that the new CEO, James Ziemer, was already a part of the organization in the capacity of CFO, also indicates that he would bring with him a deep understanding of the company's financial landscape and operations. This familiarity with the organization would likely be seen as an advantage in ensuring a seamless transition and continuity in the company’s strategic approach. In summary, this text is about the announcement of a leadership change within Harley-Davidson, where Jeffrey Bleustein, the then Chairman, and CEO, would step down from his position as CEO and pass on his responsibilities to the then CFO, James Ziemer, on April 30, 2005. This change in leadership would be important to various stakeholders in understanding its potential implications on the company's stability, future direction, and performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet Namik Kemal also wrote the important 1876 novel İntibâh (\\"Awakening\\"), while the journalist İbrahim Şinasi is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the one-act comedy \\"Şair Evlenmesi\\" (\\"The Poet's Marriage\\"). An earlier play, a farce entitled \\"Vakâyi'-i 'Acibe ve Havâdis-i Garibe-yi Kefşger Ahmed\\" (\\"The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed\\"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century, but there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist Ahmed Midhat Efendi wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mellâh yâhud Sırr İçinde Esrâr, 1873; \\"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\\"), Realism (Henüz On Yedi Yaşında, 1881; \\"Just Seventeen Years Old\\"), and Naturalism (Müşâhedât, 1891; \\"Observations\\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman social structures.

I’ve been officially on the job in the web department for all of 12 hours. I’m sitting in a conference room at a big wooden table, surrounded by my new coworkers and team members in the Getty’s web group. A big monitor is displaying the prototype of the newly designed and almost-built Getty Iris. We’re discussing The Iris logo you see at the top of this page, its multiple iterations, and, quite frankly, the pain involved in trying to get it to look right. Wait-wait-wait, let’s pause for a moment. My name is Will Lanni. I’m a Web production specialist at the Getty, which is a complex way of saying I’m a developer and designer, which is a nice way of saying that I’m basically a “web monkey.” Before I started at the Getty, I worked as a partner in a small web design and development firm for several years. I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map. And, at the time of my hiring, I was not only working on the new design and build of The Iris, due to go live in only a month, but also the soon-to-be-launched website for Pacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. So I wasn’t exactly new to projects at the Getty, even though I was a brand-spanking-new full-time employee. OK. Now that you know who I am, let’s get back to that moment.

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records.

Do you find yourself reflexively looking up every 10 minutes expecting your computer screen to have sailing on it? Have you dreamed about taking a road trip with Simone Biles, Nathan Adrian and the dragon from Pete's Dragon? If so, and even if not, you'll enjoy this list about some of the most fascinating facts about the Rio Olympics (through Tuesday). Photo: Pool After not having won a women's all-around title at a non-boycotted Olympics for the first 52 years of the event's existence, the U.S. has now produced the last four winners: Carly Patterson (2004), Nastia Liukin (2008), Gabby Douglas (2012) and Simone Biles. Not even the Soviet Union, which last competed in an Olympics in 1988 and still has almost double the gymnastics golds as the U.S., could boast pulling off such a feat. Photo: Lars Baron An Irish boxer, robbed of a match by Olympic judges, accused Vladimir Putin of rigging the Olympics. In 2012, American Christian Taylor won a gold in the triple jump but his career was soon in jeopardy when a degenerative knee problem in his jumping leg - his left - made it hard to jump so he had to stop. Yet Taylor still defended his gold in Rio. How? He switched his takeoff leg to his right. Photo: Shaun Botterill Adweek reports that the buzziest athlete of the first week of the Games wasn't Michael Phelps or Simone Biles or Usain Bolt or Kevin Durant or Katie Ledecky. Though she's hardly anonymous it was still a bit of a surprise when the woman who's now the U.S.'s most decorated gymnast - Aly Raisman - took that crown. Photo: AAron Ontiveroz There were thousands of empty seats for Usain Bolt's victory in the 100 on Sunday night, the track session that's usually the most coveted sporting ticket of the Games (ie, not including the ceremonies). Organizers say they've sold 87% of their inventory but if you look at the seats at any venue outside beach volleyball's Copacabana setup, it looks about as crowded as the upper deck at a Marlins game. It's kind of pathetic and the IOC should be embarrassed - well, more than usual. And if that wasn't bad, Brazil is on pace to become the worst-performing host nation in Olympic history. Mexico's 1968 performance, in which the hosts won 1.7% of medals, stands as the low-water mark. Brazil, as of Tuesday morning, had won 1.3% of medals. (Comparing the number of 1968 medals to 2016 medals isn't feasible given how many more events exist today.) On the bright side, the Games have gone off (mostly) without a major hitch and, no, you should not consider journalists having transportation trouble as a major hitch.

I mention this because it cannot be stated enough: Do you know how much effort it takes to turn a pool green? It's hard - like, balance beam hard. Photo: Rob Carr And not to pick on Brazil, but its fans have introduced something new to the Olympics: booing. Not too many folks were upset when soccer fans taunted Hope Solo, but there have been numerous other incidents that have set off alarms. One was the booing of a French pole vaulter who finished with a silver. The Brazilian gold medalist classily asked the crowd for respect. (And it made it all the weirder that Brazil had won the gold and fans still booed. Whatever.) There had also been countless interruptions during tennis matches, especially the Juan Martin Del Potro and Rafael Nadal epic, which pitted two factions of fans against one another, producing a U.S. Open-in-the-80s atmosphere that wasn't cool.

It's a loose cap. An athlete, such as Australian badminton player Sawan Serasinghe, is still allowed to get four packs of McNuggets, six orders of fries, six burgers, six brownies, a water and another drink (24 items), but they have to wait in line longer. There are actually two photos of Usain Bolt's now-famous grin in the 100m semifinals, one by Cameron Spencer of Getty Images (probably the one you've seen the most - pictured here) and the other by Reuters’ Kai Pfaffenbach. The latter is slightly superior given Bolt's head position, the lighting and the fact he's zoomed in a little closer. , \\"Spencer shot his using a shutter speed of 1/40th of a second, while Pfaffenbach took his at 1/50th [...] a difference of .005 seconds.\\" The three most decorated Olympians at the Games are all Americans: Michael Phelps (five gold, one silver), Katie Ledecky (four gold, one silver) and Simone Biles (four gold, one bronze). Photo: Richard Heathcote Speaking of the pool, Phelps became the oldest man to ever win an individual swimming gold when he took the 200 fly last week. He'd only become the second man in his 30s to stand on top of the podium. Then, a few days later, that mark was shattered when Anthony Ervin, 35, won the 50 freestyle. He also won gold (or tied for it) in 2000. That 16-year gap was the longest ever for a swimming gold medalist. Photo: Half Length/Vaughn Ridley Excepting the 2004 team that \\"won\\" a bronze medal, NBA players on Team USA have never played three straight games in which they won by 10 points or less, a streak that's ongoing as of Tuesday night. However, the 2000 team won games by 2 and 20 while the 2012 team won games of 5 and 7 points at varying stages of the tournament. That 2004 team, by the way, lost more games (3) than Team USA has in the history of Olympic basketball (two, but really one if you don't accept that 1972 gold-medal game result, which you shouldn't). Photo: Anadolu Images/Anadolu Agency Devon Allen, the University of Oregon junior wide receiver, finished an impressive fifth in the 110m hurdles on Tuesday night, finishing just 0.07 seconds out of the medals. He was hoping to become the first athlete to play in the Rose Bowl and win an Olympic medal but, regardless, has a bright future in either of his sports. The hurdles were a big disappointment to Team USA, however. In the 27 Olympic hurdle competitions ever entered by the U.S., they'd medaled in all 27 and won gold in 20. This was the first time an American flag wouldn't hang in the medal ceremony.

The U.S. had only won one medal in the event - a bronze by Earlene Brown in 1960 - making Carter's gold all the more impressive. Photo: AFP_EP7BK/DAMIEN MEYER American steeplechaser Emma Coburn became the first U.S. woman to win a medal in the event with a bronze on Tuesday. But, hilariously, she seemed far more excited to meet Al Michaels than she did to stand on the podium. During NBC's afternoon coverage, Coburn made her way to Copacabana to get interviewed by the legendary sportscaster. The 25-year-old told Michaels that his call of the Miracle on Ice (which happened 10 years before she was born) was an inspiration to her. \\"I grew up playing hockey and you are like a god to me,\\" she told him. \\"You’re like a hero to me. I am so star struck right now.\\" She then said Michaels was a \\"big reason of why I'm here.\\" It was sweet and awesome, though she really missed an opportunity to ask Michaels about those mysterious Carrie Underwood commercials. When you take away the boycotted Games of 1980 and 1984, Team USA is on pace for the biggest medal blowout since the 1948 Olympics. But, hey, we still have five days left.

Please answer the following question: Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers   are considered one of the most important marine weapons in the 20th century. So far, only two countries in the world--the prefix = st1 /USAandFrance--have ever produced them. But these frightful fighting machines are about to enter Asia. The US Navy said last month that one of its nine nuclear-powered aircraft carriers will be sent to Japanto replace the diesel-powered carrier Kitty Hawk in 2009 in an agreement on October 30th. The two countries also planned to level up their military cooperation and theUSAcalled forJapanto take a large role in alliance military moves. It will be the first time that a nuclear-powered carrier is based in Japan. Bombed byUSforces in World War II at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,Japanis the only world country to have been attacked by a nuclear weapon. Therefore, the citizens are highly sensitive to where nuclear-powered weapons are based. \\"A radiation leak at Yokosuka would kill 100,000 people as far away as Tokyo, and could cause billions of dollars in damage,\\" said Masahiko Go to, leader of a protest group inYokosuka. His group has collected more than 300,000 signatures of people acrossJapanopposed to the nuclear carrier. The 44-year-old Kitty Hawk, the USnavy's oldest active ship, has been based in Yokosuda since 1998. The new carrier, yet to be _ , will travel faster, be capable of supporting longer operations and carry with it the Navy's most modern technology. Experts pointed that this change is not only to strengthen the US-Japan military alliance but also to keep the military power of ChinaandNorth Koreawithin limits. However, Japanese experts don't believe that the countries are threats to the region. \\"There is no need for Japanto have a nuclear carrier as defense,\\" said Tetsuo Maeda, an international relations professor atTokyoInternationalUniversity. He said that the change of ship indicates an increased military capacity, in the region, much more than what is needed.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose piece is now called the Festive Symphony?  Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech...

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? will nevertheless find moving .","output":"The given phrase \\"will nevertheless find moving\\" can be considered as having a neutral connotation by itself; however, its positive or negative aspect largely depends on the context in which it is being used. To analyze the phrase further, let's break it down into individual components: 1. \\"Will\\" - This word indicates a future action or event. 2. \\"Nevertheless\\" - This conjunction signifies that the statement contradicts or contrasts with a previous statement. 3. \\"Find\\" - This verb suggests discovering, identifying or recognizing something. 4. \\"Moving\\" - This adjective is used to describe something that arouses emotions, often deep or sentimental feelings. Now let's look at the phrase within both positive and negative contexts: Positive context:  Imagine the phrase being used in the following sentence - \\"Even though they initially disliked the movie, they will nevertheless find moving scenes that touch their hearts.\\" In this context, the phrase refers to experiencing moving or emotional moments, despite having a negative predisposition towards the movie. This usage gives it a positive connotation. Negative context: On the other hand, consider the phrase is used like this - \\"Despite trying to avoid emotional turmoil, they will nevertheless find moving instances that bring back unpleasant memories.\\" In this case, the phrase reveals the inevitability of encountering emotional situations that evoke negative feelings, which makes the phrase's meaning negative. To summarize, the phrase \\"will nevertheless find moving\\" can be interpreted as either positive or negative, greatly dependent on the context in which it is used.

Abbot Howard Hoffman (November 30, 1936 - April 12, 1989) was an American political and social activist, anarchist, and revolutionary who co-founded the Youth International Party (\\"Yippies\\"). Hoffman was arrested and tried for conspiracy and inciting to riot as a result of his role in protests that led to violent confrontations with police during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, along with Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, and Bobby Seale. The group was known collectively as the \\"Chicago Eight\\"; when Seale's prosecution was separated from the others, they became known as the Chicago Seven. While the defendants were initially convicted of intent to incite a riot, the verdicts were overturned on appeal. Hoffman was arrested and tried for conspiracy and inciting to riot as a result of his role in anti-Vietnam War protests, which were met by a violent police response during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He was among the group that came to be known as the Chicago Seven (originally known as the Chicago Eight), which included fellow Yippie Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, future California state senator Tom Hayden and Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale (before his trial was severed from the others).  Presided over by Judge Julius Hoffman (no relation to Hoffman, about which he joked throughout the trial), Abbie Hoffman's courtroom antics frequently grabbed the headlines; one day, defendants Hoffman and Rubin appeared in court dressed in judicial robes, while on another day, Hoffman was sworn in as a witness with his hand giving the finger. Judge Hoffman became the favorite courtroom target of the Chicago Seven defendants, who frequently would insult the judge to his face. Abbie Hoffman told Judge Hoffman \\"you are a 'shande fur de Goyim' [disgrace in front of the gentiles]. You would have served Hitler better.\\" He later added that \\"your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room.\\" Both Davis and Rubin told the Judge \\"this court is bullshit.\\" When Hoffman was asked in what state he resided, he replied the \\"state of mind of my brothers and sisters\\".  Other celebrities were called as \\"cultural witnesses\\" including Allen Ginsberg, Phil Ochs, Arlo Guthrie, Norman Mailer and others. Hoffman closed the trial with a speech in which he quoted Abraham Lincoln, making the claim that the president himself, if alive today, would also be arrested in Chicago's Lincoln Park.  On February 18, 1970, Hoffman and four of the other defendants (Rubin, Dellinger, Davis, and Hayden) were found guilty of intent to incite a riot while crossing state lines. All seven defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy. At sentencing, Hoffman suggested the judge try LSD and offered to set him up with \\"a dealer he knew in Florida\\" (the judge was known to be headed to Florida for a post-trial vacation). Each of the five was sentenced to five years in prison and a 5,000 fine.  However, all convictions were subsequently overturned by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

Possible A: canon, machine, battle field, tornado, weapon  Why is \\"canon\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Canon\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense as it directly pertains to the context of a projectile, especially when discussing a ball-shaped projectile. Typically, when humans refer to projectiles being launched or propelled, they often think of objects such as cannonballs, bullets, or missiles. In this case, we are talking about a ball projectile, which implies that the object being shot or propelled is round and potentially heavy. Cannons are well-known historical devices that have been extensively used in warfare, ceremonies, and symbolic shows of power over many centuries. Designed for launching heavy, round projectiles – commonly known as cannonballs – these artillery weapons work by utilizing explosive charges to generate enough force to propel the projectile at high velocities. In many historical contexts, cannons have played significant roles, from naval and land battles to signaling the start of events and celebrations. The other possible answers listed – machine, battle field, tornado, and weapon – may initially seem relevant to the context but fail to provide a clear association with the launching of a ball projectile. \\"Machine\\" is too vague, as there are many different types of machines with various functions, not all of which involve propulsion. \\"Battle field\\" refers to a location where fierce, violent encounters between warring parties occur, but it doesn't define a specific object or method for propelling a projectile. \\"Tornado\\" is a natural weather phenomenon, unrelated to the intentional launching of projectiles. Finally, \\"weapon\\" is a general term that encompasses a wide array of devices and objects designed for inflicting harm or damage, but it doesn't directly imply the involvement of a projectile, let alone one with a spherical shape. Thus, \\"canon\\" (assuming it is meant as \\"cannon\\") is the answer that aligns best with human common sense because it has a direct and well-established association with the launching of heavy, round projectiles such as cannonballs. Its widespread historical usage and implementation in military and ceremonial contexts further strengthen its relevance to the question, making it the most logical and appropriate answer among the given options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Combine facts and answer this: What is the name of the four-year coeducational federal service academy located in Orange County and which was attended by Robert Emlen Boyers, a United States Army officer and American football player and coach who served as head coach there? Answer:","output":"The name of the four-year coeducational federal service academy located in Orange County, attended by Robert Emlen Boyers, is the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point. The USMA is a prestigious institution that has produced numerous notable alumni, including Robert Emlen Boyers, who was an accomplished United States Army officer and American football player and coach. The United States Military Academy, founded in 1802, is situated in West Point, New York, which is within Orange County. It is a highly respected institution that offers a rigorous academic and physical program to prepare young men and women for careers as officers in the United States Army. The academy is known for its motto, \\"Duty, Honor, Country,\\" and has long-standing traditions that are inextricably woven into the fabric of the institution. Robert Emlen Boyers, born on February 15, 1890 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, was a prominent figure in American sports history. He attended the United States Military Academy, where he played football for the Army team as a halfback and quarterback. After graduating from the academy in 1913, Boyers embarked on a military career that eventually saw him reach the rank of Brigadier General in the United States Army. In addition to his distinguished military service, Boyers is known for his career in American football. He served as the head football coach at the United States Military Academy from 1918 to 1920. During his time as coach, Boyers led teams to a record of 16 wins, 5 losses, and 2 ties. His coaching tenure at West Point was marked by a successful period for the Army football program, which included a particularly notable win in 1919 against a formidable Navy team. This victory was largely attributed to Boyers' innovative coaching style and his ability to nurture the talents of his players. In conclusion, the United States Military Academy at West Point, located in Orange County, is a prestigious federal service academy attended by Robert Emlen Boyers. This accomplished United States Army officer and American football player and coach also served as the head football coach at West Point, successfully leading the Army team and contributing to the storied history of the academy."},{"instruction":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: The Swarm Movie plot: A group of soldiers led by Major Baker (Bradford Dillman) is ordered to investigate a basement level station which they believed was attacked. After Baker contacts his commander, Gen. Slater (Richard Widmark), they begin to investigate who drove a civilian van into the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist named Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), the only survivor of the attack. Slater orders two helicopters to check for a black mass (revealed to be bees), but the two helicopters are swarmed by the bees and explode, killing the pilots inside. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by the same African killer bees that destroyed the helicopters. Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.Meanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. The teenaged son manages to escape in a Mustang, although he is also stung, and crashes into the Maryville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens) who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation.Recovering from his earlier bee attack, the stung son and some friends go in search of the hive to firebomb it, which results only in angering the bees, who head to Marysville. The bees reach Marysville and kill hundreds, including some children at the local school. Crane and Helena take shelter at the local diner, with pregnant café waitress Rita (Patty...

Question: Information:  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - The Habsburg Monarchy or Empire, occasionally also styled as the Danubian Monarchy (\\"Donaumonarchie\\"), is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918. The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.  - Solomon Judah Löb HaKohen Rapoport ( June 1 , 1786 -- October 15 , 1867 ) ( Hebrew :     ) , was a Galician rabbi and Jewish scholar . He was born in Lemberg , Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria . He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller , the daughter of the well - known Aryeh Leib Heller , and was instrumental in publishing the work Avnei Miluim of his father in law . He wrote both the index , sources and numerous comments . After various experiences in business , Rapoport became rabbi of Tarnopol ( 1837 ) and of Prague ( 1840 ) . He was one of the founders of the new Wissenschaft des Judentums movement . His chief work was the first part of an ( unfinished ) encyclopaedia ( Erekh Millin , 1852 ) . Equally notable were his biographies of Saadia Gaon , Nathan ( author of the Arukh ) , Hai Gaon , Eleazar Kalir and others . Thrown upon his own resources about 1817 , Rapoport became the collector of the meat - tax on farmers . He had already given evidence of marked critical ability , though his writings previously published were of a light character -- poems and translations . His critical talent , however , soon revealed itself . In 1824 he wrote an article for Bikkure ha - ' Ittim on the independent Jewish tribes of Arabia and Abyssinia . Though this article gained him some recognition , a more permanent impression was made by his work on Saadia Gaon and his times ( published in the same journal in 1829 ) , the first of a series of biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages . Because of this work he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained many enthusiastic friends , especially S. D. Luzzatto . After the fashion in rabbinic circles , Rapoport was known by an acronym \`\` Shir '' , formed by the initial letters of his Hebrew name Shelomo Yehuda Rapoport ( Shir literally means \`\` song '' in Hebrew )  - The First Partition of Poland took place in 1772 as the first of three partitions that ended the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers.  - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.  - The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known as Galicia or Austrian Poland, became a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. From 1804 to 1918 it was a crownland of the Austrian Empire. After the reforms of 1867, it became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \\"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\\".  - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin.  - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah.

There are no lush rugs or stylish furniture. The large table in the conference room is simple varnished wood. Offices are small and mostly plain, except for the eclectic mix of pop art, African statuary and neon that adorns litigation director Webb Brewer's space.

He wrote about three hundred papers, making important contributions to set theory and topology. Hypothesis: Alexandrov invented geometry.","output":"No, we cannot draw the hypothesis that Alexandrov invented geometry from the given context. Pavel Sergeyevich Alexandrov was a Soviet mathematician known for his important contributions to set theory and topology, but he was not the inventor of geometry. Geometry has a long history that dates back to ancient civilizations. Its foundation can be traced back to early mathematicians in ancient Egypt and the Babylonian Empire around 2000-3000 BCE. These early mathematicians made several discoveries related to basic geometric concepts such as lengths, areas, and angles. The ancient Greek mathematician Euclid is often referred to as the \\"father of geometry,\\" as he made significant advances in the field. Euclid's \\"Elements,\\" a compilation of 13 books on geometry, laid the foundation for the subject and has been used as a textbook for thousands of years. So, we can say that Alexandrov did not invent geometry as it already had an extensive history and was well established by the time he made his contributions to mathematics. The context does indicate that Alexandrov made substantial contributions to set theory and topology. Set theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of sets, or collections of objects. Alexandrov contributed to the understanding of the connections between set theory and other areas of mathematics, such as algebra, logic, and geometry. Topology, another field of mathematics that Alexandrov contributed to, is sometimes called \\"rubber-sheet geometry.\\" It is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of spaces that remain unchanged when they are deformed, stretched, or squeezed. Alexandrov helped develop and clarify the concepts and tools used in topology, and his work led to significant advancements in the understanding of topological properties and structures. In summary, while Pavel Sergeyevich Alexandrov was an influential mathematician who contributed to set theory and topology, he did not invent geometry. The field of geometry has a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations and was well established by the time Alexandrov made his contributions to mathematics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body.  Question: suppose more heat drawn from sweat happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"A: More The process of sweat evaporating and cooling the body plays an important role in maintaining proper body temperature, particularly during physical activities or in warm environments. When heat is drawn from the sweat during the evaporation process, it cools the body. Therefore, if more heat is drawn from the sweat, it will have a direct effect on enhancing the body's cooling mechanism. To elaborate, here's an in-depth explanation of what occurs when more heat is drawn from the sweat: 1. Increase in sweat evaporation rate: When more heat is drawn from the sweat, it means that the sweat is evaporating at a faster rate. The evaporation process transforms the liquid sweat into a gas, which is then released into the air. 2. Faster dissipation of body heat: As the sweat evaporates more rapidly, the heat that is drawn from the body is also released at a faster pace. This effectively transfers the body heat into the surrounding environment, cooling the body down more efficiently. 3. Enhanced thermoregulation: Regulating body temperature is essential to keep our bodily functions running smoothly. When more heat is drawn from the sweat, it improves the body's ability to maintain a stable internal temperature. This is particularly crucial in situations where external factors like warm environments or strenuous physical activities can put the body's temperature under stress. 4. Cooling effect of remaining sweat: As the evaporation of sweat draws heat away from the body, the remaining sweat on the skin is also cooled. This subsequently leads to further cooling of the body's surface, which in turn helps to lower the overall body temperature. 5. Diligent work of sweat glands: If more heat is drawn from the sweat, it signifies that the sweat glands are working efficiently to produce sweat. Proper sweat production is vital to keep the body cool and prevent overheating. In conclusion, if more heat is drawn from the sweat, it will directly lead to more body cooling occurring. This helps the body maintain an optimal internal temperature, ensuring that our vital organs function smoothly and our physical wellbeing remains uncompromised."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was a warm summer day, and Erin had convinced Jennifer to come along and join a game of soccer with the local boys from the neighborhood. Though hesitant, Jennifer eventually agreed, hoping to prove that she could be just as fun and carefree as her more adventurous friend. As they made their way to the park, Erin offered Jennifer words of encouragement, assuring her that she would do just fine. When they arrived at the soccer field, they found a group of boys already playing a heated match. The boys glanced up, eyeing both Erin and Jennifer as they approached. Erin, confident and at ease, waved and called out to the boys. \\"Hey, guys! Got room for a couple more players?\\" The boys exchanged glances, the majority of them already familiar with Erin and her competitive spirit. \\"Yeah, sure! We could use some extra players to even out the teams,\\" one of the taller boys, Andrew, replied with a grin. Erin grabbed Jennifer's hand, dragging her towards the assembled group as she offered quick introductions. As they divided up into teams, Erin naturally fell into the role of an offensive player, darting across the field with skill and enthusiasm. Jennifer, on the other hand, found herself stationed at the back, doing her best to defend their goal. It quickly became apparent that Jennifer's experience in soccer was limited, but her natural agility and determination to keep up with the others soon had her making some remarkable saves. As the game progressed, Jennifer's confidence grew with each successful block. Even though she couldn't be as aggressive as Erin, Jennifer learned that her own unique qualities were valuable in the game. She was slowly developing her own style of play, taking inspiration from Erin's fearlessness, but also incorporating a level of precision and grace that her friend didn't possess. The two girls worked together beautifully, Erin at the front leading the charge, and Jennifer guarding their defenses like a sentinel. Erin's team ended up winning the game, much to the delight of both girls.

At the meeting, Mr. Obama sent a warning to China, declaring that the United States would “continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows” and that “we will support the right of all countries to do the same.” He said he had discussed with the leaders the need to halt further reclamation and militarization of islands in the South China Sea. “What China is doing is worrisome because they’re obviously increasing their capacity for surveillance and for sustaining a presence that is well beyond what they’ve had before,” said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a senior fellow and an expert on China at the Brookings Institution. But even as Beijing reclaims land to bolster its claims to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea and its many reefs and islets, the United States is likely to move cautiously, current and former officials said. It does not want to set off a military confrontation with China over territorial claims on which the United States has not taken a position. Moreover, the Asian countries remain divided over how robustly to resist China’s expansion. Maritime countries like the Philippines and Vietnam, which have competing claims with Beijing, are pushing for more vigorous action, while continental countries like Laos and Cambodia, which have close economic ties to China, are reluctant to provoke their neighbor. Those divisions were evident in the wording of a joint statement issued at the end of the California meeting, which asserted the need for freedom of navigation and the peaceful resolution of disputes, but made no direct mention of China or the South China Sea. A senior administration official said the specific weapons system that China had placed on the island was less of an issue than the signal it sent to neighbors. China’s move appeared to be a coincidence, despite its disclosure just hours after the end of the summit meeting. Representatives from Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan condemned China’s move to deploy missiles from an artificial island in the South China Sea. The United States official who described the missile batteries, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, did not give details about how many missiles were on the island, known as Woody Island, or how long they had been there. But another official said they appeared to be operational. Taiwan’s Defense Ministry also issued a statement on Wednesday saying that antiaircraft missiles were present on the island. The Chinese Defense Ministry did not confirm or deny the deployment, but noted that the Chinese Navy and Air Force had maintained forces on the Paracel Islands “for many years.” “The Paracel Islands have always been a part of China’s territory,” the ministry said in a statement. “China has the legitimate and legal rights to deploy defense facilities within its territory, in order to defend the sovereignty and security of the country.” It dismissed the reports about the missile deployment as “hype by certain Western media outlets.” Tensions are also rising elsewhere in the region. The United States is in formal talks with South Korea about moving an antiballistic missile system to the peninsula to deter an attack from North Korea. The Chinese government has objected to the system, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, saying it would be a threat to its security. The Chinese missile deployment in the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea was reported by Fox News, which said pictures from ImageSat International showed that two missile batteries had appeared on the island sometime between Feb. 3 and Sunday. The missiles have a range of about 200 kilometers, or 125 miles, and are capable of destroying aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, according to Missile Threat, a website run by the George C. Marshall Institute in Arlington, Va. “It’s not that they would use the missiles to shoot down a plane,” said Mr. Lieberthal, of the Brookings Institution. “That would be a game changer. The question is, are we going to see a situation where they turn targeting radar on a ship conducting a freedom of navigation mission?” Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the head of the United States Pacific Command, said on Wednesday that the missile deployment, if verified, would go against pledges not to militarize the South China Sea that China’s president, Xi Jinping, made at the White House in September. But Mr. Xi, in his remarks in Washington, referred specifically to the Spratlys, a different chain of islets and reefs, and not to the Paracels when saying that China “does not intend to pursue militarization.” Zhu Feng, a professor at Nanjing University who studies China’s foreign policy, said the Chinese made a distinction among South China Sea island groups. He noted that the Paracels were much closer to the Chinese mainland than the Spratlys, which are more than 250 miles to the south and have been the focus of much of China’s island-building efforts. Woody Island, known as Yongxing in China, has a military airstrip that juts out from both ends of the small island and is used by fighter aircraft. It also has a military garrison and a civilian government building. The missiles may give the United States and other nations pause before they send aircraft over the area to challenge China’s maritime claims, said Euan Graham, the director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, Australia. “There may be a military element to this, but also a signaling element,” Mr. Graham said.

Option I: Pile the briquettes on one side of the grill then put the grill and cook the meat on the grill on the side where the briquettes are. Step 1: Pile the briquettes on one side of the grill. - This creates a high heat zone on one side of the grill. Step 2: Cook the meat on the side of the grill with the briquettes. - Cooking the meat directly over the heat source will expose it to high heat, which may cause uneven cooking and possibly burn the meat, especially for large cuts that require a longer cooking time. Option II: Pile the briquettes on one side of the grill then put the grill and cook the meat on the grill on the side where there are no briquettes. Step 1: Pile the briquettes on one side of the grill. - This creates a high heat zone on one side and a lower heat zone on the other side of the grill. Step 2: Cook the meat on the side of the grill without the briquettes. - By cooking the meat on the side without the briquettes, it will be indirectly exposed to the heat, allowing for more even cooking without the risk of burning. This is ideal for larger cuts of meat or items that require a longer cooking time. Based on the analysis, the better solution for setting up a charcoal grill for indirect heat is: Option II: Pile the briquettes on one side of the grill then put the grill and cook the meat on the grill on the side where there are no briquettes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Test sentence: \\"I can well imagine with a hatchet Mary destroying the Jeep.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"Yes, the given test sentence, \\"I can well imagine with a hatchet Mary destroying the Jeep,\\" is grammatically correct, but it should be noted that it could be restructured for clarity. In its current form, the sentence presents some ambiguity as to who is wielding the hatchet and who is performing the action of destroying the Jeep. However, before delving into an examination of potential improvements, we should first analyze the grammatical elements present in the original construction. 1. The subject of the sentence is \\"I,\\" referring to the speaker. 2. \\"Can well imagine\\" is an idiomatic verbal expression that implies a strong ability to envision something. The verb \\"can\\" is the auxiliary verb in this construction, while \\"imagine\\" serves as the main verb. \\"Well,\\" an adverb, strengthens the speaker's claims regarding their ability to imagine the situation. 3. \\"With a hatchet\\" is an adverbial prepositional phrase indicating the means or instrument used for the action (in this case, destroying the Jeep). 4. \\"Mary destroying the Jeep\\" is the object phrase that the speaker is imagining. \\"Mary\\" is the implied subject of this phrase, while \\"destroying\\" serves as the present participle, denoting an ongoing action. \\"The Jeep\\" is the direct object, referring to the recipient of the destruction action. Though grammatically correct, the sentence could benefit from restructuring in order to establish greater clarity and lessen potential ambiguity. Here are some alternative constructions that would more effectively convey the intended meaning: 1. \\"I can well imagine Mary destroying the Jeep with a hatchet.\\" 2. \\"With a hatchet, I can well imagine Mary destroying the Jeep.\\" In both of these examples, the adverbial prepositional phrase \\"with a hatchet\\" has been relocated to emphasize either the means used by Mary to destroy the Jeep (example 1) or the manner in which the speaker imagines the scene (example 2). By repositioning this phrase, the sentence now demonstrates clearer syntactical relationships between its components. In summary, while the initial test sentence can be considered grammatically correct, it would be more effectively communicated through alternative constructions that more explicitly establish the syntactic relationships between its various elements. This clarity ensures that readers or listeners can accurately understand who is performing the action, what the action entails, and how the action is being carried out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Question: how the capital of brazil, brasilia was created? Would \\"However, as a metropolitan area , it ranks lower at sixth in population.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"To answer the question about how the capital of Brazil, Brasília, was created, I will provide a detailed explanation and then determine if the statement given could be considered a reasonable answer. Step 1: Research Brasília's history Brasília was founded on April 21, 1960, following a constitutional provision to create a new capital for Brazil that would be more centrally located than the previous capital, Rio de Janeiro. Step 2: Discuss the reasons for this decision The primary reason for this decision was to promote economic growth and development in the interior regions of the country and reduce the concentration of political and administrative power in the coastal cities. Step 3: Describe the planning and construction process The city was designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and urban planner Lúcio Costa. It was built from scratch in a region called Planalto Central, which was previously sparsely populated. The plan of the city has a unique layout shaped like a plane, with separate zones designated for specific functions, such as governmental, residential, and commercial areas. Step 4: Reflect on the city's growth and current status Since its creation, Brasília has grown rapidly and transformed the surrounding region. It now serves as the political and administrative center of Brazil, hosting the country's federal government institutions. Now, let's evaluate the given statement: \\"However, as a metropolitan area, it ranks lower at sixth in population.\\" It is true that, despite its political importance, Brasília is ranked sixth among the largest metropolitan areas in Brazil in terms of population. This fact, however, does not directly address the question of how and why the city was created. In conclusion, a more reasonable answer to the question of how Brasília was created would be to emphasize the city's founding as a means to promote economic growth and development in the interior of Brazil and discuss its unique design and construction process. The statement about Brasília's population ranking as a metropolitan area can certainly be mentioned, but it should not be the sole focus of the answer."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Information:  - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.   - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - Pope Urban II (  29 July 1099), born Odo of Châtillon or Otho de Lagery, was Pope from 12 March 1088 to his death in 1099. He is best known for initiating the First Crusade (109699) and setting up the modern-day Roman Curia in the manner of a royal ecclesiastical court to help run the Church.  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - Arnulf Malecorne of Chocques ( or of Rohes ) ( died 1118 ) was a leader among the clergy during the First Crusade , and was Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1099 and from 1112 to 1118 .  - The Dead Sea (lit. Salt Sea), is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west. Its surface and shores are below sea level, Earth's lowest elevation on land. The Dead Sea is deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With 34.2% salinity (in 2011), it is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean, and one of the world's saltiest bodies of water. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea is long and wide at its widest point. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley and its main tributary is the Jordan River.  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - The Kingdom of Judah (\\"Mamlekhet Yehudh\\") was an Iron Age kingdom of the Southern Levant. The Hebrew Bible depicts it as the successor to a United Monarchy, but historians are divided about the veracity of this account. In the 10th and early 9th centuries BCE the territory of Judah appears to have been sparsely populated, limited to small rural settlements, most of them unfortified. Jerusalem, the kingdom's capital, likely did not emerge as a significant administrative centre until the end of the 8th century, prior to this archaeological evidence suggests its population was too small to sustain a viable kingdom. In the 7th century its population increased greatly, prospering under Assyrian vassalage (despite Hezekiah's revolt against the Assyrian king Sennacherib), but in 605 the Assyrian Empire was defeated, and the ensuing competition between the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean led to the destruction of the kingdom in a series of campaigns between 597 and 582, the deportation of the elite of the community, and the incorporation of Judah into a province of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

Wade county was situated to the east of Gray county. Due to afavorable landscape, Wade county built more roads and railways.  Which county would develop socially more in the future?  Hint: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the information provided, Wade county would likely develop socially more in the future. Step 1: Consider the existing infrastructure Wade county has more roads and railways, which would contribute to better connectivity and easier transportation between various locations within the county. This would allow residents to travel more easily and interact with other communities. Step 2: Apply the distance decay effect The distance decay effect suggests that the interaction between two locales decreases as the distance between them increases. In the case of Wade county, the greater connectivity through roads and railways could reduce the impact of distance decay, increasing the chances of social development. Step 3: Consider the impact of advances in communications technology Although advances in communication technology have lessened the effects of distance, it is still important to consider the physical infrastructure of a county. As previously mentioned, Wade county has a favorable landscape for the construction of roads and railways. This would contribute to physical accessibility, encourage social interactions, and facilitate social development. Step 4: Compare the counties Since Gray county is situated to the west of Wade county, it does not have the same level of infrastructure and landscape as Wade county, which would negatively affect its social development in comparison to Wade county. Conclusion: Thus, based on the existing infrastructure, the distance decay effect, advances in communications technology, and comparative advantages, Wade county is more likely to develop socially further in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Intellectual property (IP) is a product of the mind that has commercial value. The concept dates back to 1623, when the first patent law to protect IP rights was passed. IP rights protect an artist from having his/her creative ideas copied by another. For example, if somebody generated an idea for a novel, that idea is protected by IP rights. If someone else wishes to represent the idea or develop it further, he/she must consult the original artists, who will normally be rewarded financially for its use. Back in the 17thcentury, IP rights were primarily carried out to protect newly developed manufacturing processes against stealing, but today intellectual property rights are also enjoyed by those who create music, art and literature. In recent years, IP rights have been the focus of a great deal of discussion because of a technology which looks set to weaken them altogether: the Internet. Many years ago, if you wanted a recoding of a song, you would have to purchase it from a music store; if a novel, from a book store. In those days, IP rights were easily protected since it was very difficult to obtain intellectual property without paying for it. However, a lot of IP, including songs, films, books and artwork, can be downloaded today free of charge using the internet. This practice has now taken the world by storm, dramatically affecting the way in which we view IP rights. Question: What do we know about the Internet according to the passage? - It does not affect the way we understand IP rights. - It sells songs and films. - It makes IP rights harder to protect. - It prevents the production of artwork.","output":"According to the passage, we know that the Internet makes IP rights harder to protect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006. In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called \\"Shows\\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney. In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \\"Shows\\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners. In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service, which is available only to users in the US, Canada and the UK as of 2010. The service offers over 6,000 films.

These pies were sometimes made in\\"reeds  \\", which were used for the purpose of holding the filling ( ), and were not eaten. The Romans spread the word about pies around Europe and the word\\"pie\\"became a popular word in the 14th century. The first pie recipe   was also published by the Romans. Pies first appeared in England as early as the twelfth century. The early pies were mostly meat pies. There was actually more crust than filling. Often these pies were made from fowl ( ) and the fowl's legs were left to hang over the side of the dish and used as handles. Fruit pies were probably first made in the 1500s. It is said that Queen Elizabeth I made the first cherry pie. Pie came to America with the first English settlers. The early settlers cooked their pies in long narrow pans. As in the Roman times, the early American pie crusts were often not eaten, but simply used to hold the filling during baking(@&*).

Given the two facts above, he penetration of the egg by a sperm takes place inside what? Answer:","output":"Given the two facts above, the penetration of the egg by a sperm takes place inside the female organism. In more specific terms, the process usually happens within the fallopian tubes of the female reproductive system after ovulation. Here's a brief rundown of the process: 1. Ovulation: Typically once a month, an egg is released from the ovary and travels down the fallopian tube. 2. Fertilization: If sexual intercourse has taken place and sperm is present, it may meet the egg in the fallopian tube. One sperm penetrates the egg, leading to fertilization. 3. Implantation: The fertilized egg then continues down to the uterus, where it implants itself into the uterine lining and begins to grow. That's a simplified description of the process, but overall, given your facts, the answer is that the penetration of the egg by the sperm takes place within the female organism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Below is a possible conversation that might have taken place between Tom and Jane, discussing their plans for the evening: Tom: Hey Jane, what do you think we should do this evening? Jane: Hi Tom! Hmm, let me think. We have a few options, don't we? We could go out for dinner, watch a movie, or just hang out at my place and play some board games. Tom: Yeah, those are some great options. What about trying that new Italian restaurant that just opened downtown? I've heard some great things about their pasta dishes.  Jane: Oh, that does sound tempting. My colleague recommended their lasagna, and she said it was amazing. But what about catching a movie afterwards? You know how much I enjoy ending the night with a good film. Tom: That sounds like a plan. I believe there's a new action movie playing at the cinema tonight. We both enjoy those kinds of films, right? We could grab an early dinner and then head over to the theater. Jane: Perfect! I love a good action flick. I'll go online and check what time it is playing, just to be sure we can make it after dinner.  Tom: Great. I'll go ahead and book us a table at the restaurant. Do you have any dietary restrictions I should keep in mind while making the reservation? Jane: Oh, thanks for asking, Tom. I'm trying to avoid gluten, so it would be great if the new restaurant offers gluten-free options. But if they don't, I'm sure I will find something delicious on the menu. Tom: No problem, I'll make sure to mention that while making the reservation. Also, since we are talking about movies, have you seen that new series everyone's been raving about lately? A few of my friends have mentioned it to me, and it looks interesting. We could add that to our list of things to watch later on. Jane: I've seen a few episodes, and it's indeed worth watching. We can definitely start it together after we finish the current series we're watching. Anything else you'd like to include in our evening plans? Tom: I think we've got it all planned out quite well. Dinner at the Italian restaurant, followed by the action movie at the cinema, and then maybe grab a cup of coffee before heading back home.  Jane: Sounds perfect to me! Let's make plans to meet at the restaurant around 6 PM? That should give us enough time to enjoy our meal without feeling rushed. Tom: Agreed, 6 PM it is. I'll see you there, Jane. Have a great day, and I'm looking forward to our fun evening together. Jane: Thanks, Tom. You too! Can't wait to catch up and enjoy our evening plans.

The grand inquisitor is none other then her estranged brother, Prince Vajda, who renounces his ties to his sister. As the executioner ties her down to the stake, Asa defiantly swears retribution by returning from the dead one day. The executioner positions a spike-lined metal mask over her face. On her brother's command, a swift hammer blow drives the mask into her skull, killing her instantly. She is then interred in the family crypt in a coffin equipped with a window, thought which the sign of the cross is visible. With the cross forever visible to her lifeless body, it is said that the witch will never return to life.200 years later, Doctors Kruvejan (Andrea Checchi) and Gorovek (John Richardson) are riding in a carriage from St. Petersburg to Moscow on their way to a medical conference. A wheel on the carriage slips out of its socket. Leaving the driver to repair the damage, the pair decide to investigate an old ruined chapel nearby, where they discover the witch's coffin in the crypt below. Kruvejan is suddenly attacked by a large bat, and when he beats it to death in his cane, he accidentally smashes the stone cross position over the window. The fragments from the cross smash the glass, enabling Kruvejan to pull away the witch's mask. Her face is sunken and decayed, but is otherwise intact. Gorovek convinces his friend to leave before the driver becomes overly anxious, but unbeknownst to both, blood from a small cut on Kruvejans hand is already working to revive Asa.Outside the chapel, the two doctors are startled by Princess Katia (Barbara Steele in a dual role), the daughter of Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani). Gorovek is immediately smitten with her. The sad, seemingly fixed expression she wears tells of an unhappy nature, which is bourn out by her saying that the chapel is her father's property and he refuses to fix it up.The men continue their journey, stopping for the night at a...
