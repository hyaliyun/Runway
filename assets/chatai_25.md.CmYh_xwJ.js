Movie plot title: Lord Love a Duck Movie plot: From his prison cell, Alan Musgrave dictates his experiences of the previous year, which he dedicated to fulfilling the unending wishes and ambitions of high school senior Barbara Ann Greene. The daughter of Marie, a cocktail waitress sinking unhappily into her forties, Barbara Ann wants every kind of success and for everyone to love her. Signing a pact with Alan in wet cement, Barbara Ann soon has the 12 cashmere sweaters needed to join an exclusive girls' club. She drops out of school to become the principal's new secretary and gets involved in church activities run by strait-laced but hyper-hormonal Bob Bernard. When Barbara Ann decides she wants Bob for her husband, Alan facilitates by keeping Bob's eccentric mother Stella, who disapproves of Barbara Ann, perpetually plastered. Then Barbara meets schlock producer T. Harrison Belmont, the King of Beach Party movies, and decides to become the biggest star that ever was. Bob refuses, however, to allow his wife to have a Hollywood screen test, so Barbara Ann decides she wants a divorce. Since Bob's mother frowns upon divorce, Alan takes matters into his own hands to kill Bob. Although Bob proves to be almost indestructible, by graduation time Alan has him in a wheelchair. At the graduation ceremony, Alan pursues Bob with a tractor, apparently killing him and several people on the speakers' platform.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In Europe, people hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right throughout the meal, a system that is generally agreed to be more efficient than the American zigzag method. Americans hold both the fork and the knife in their right hands throughout the meal, so they continually change their forks to the left hand when they have to cut their meat. It seems to be funny for the Europeans to see Americans busy changing their dinner sets, making a lot of noises. A few explanations for this American style are as follows: (1) Americans are practical and efficient. Since most of us are right-handed, it is reasonable to keep our working tools at all times in the right hand that can use them most efficiently. (2) Americans, the master of the New World are rebels .They use the zigzag method to break the rules in the Old World and in this way they are thumbing their nose at Mother England. Americans are a restless kind. They do not like to sit in one spot for very long when dining. (3) Forced to do so, they respond by \\"playing\\" with the silver. Whatever the reason for the practice, it is now certainly as American as apple pie. Europeans recognize this and are quick to attack it as evidence of American innocence of form. Arguments against the zigzag method rest not only on grounds of efficiency but also on those of tradition. In Old World dining, the knife is held in the right hand continually because it can serve as an instant defense against the uninvited intruders .However, such alertness  is out of place in the New World, as every American believes that this is the home of the brave. Americans _ their silverware, perhaps, to show that they are not afraid and that one of them holding a fork is worth any number of them holding blades .

Please answer the following question: Question: what organisms cannot grow on a glucose salt medium I found the following answer on Google: The most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths and agar plates ; specialized media are sometimes required for microorganism and cell culture growth. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer provided does not specifically address the question about which organisms cannot grow on a glucose salt medium. While nutrient broths and agar plates are common growth media for microorganisms, and specialized media are sometimes required for specific microorganisms and cell culture growth, this does not identify the organisms that cannot grow on a glucose salt medium. A glucose salt medium is a minimal medium that usually contains glucose as the sole carbon source and essential salts like potassium, magnesium, and sodium salts for the necessary ions and required nutrients. This minimal medium is designed to limit the types of organisms that can grow on it since it provides only the basic components required for survival and growth.  Many microorganisms can grow on glucose salt medium; however, some organisms are unable to grow due to their specific nutritional requirements. Some examples of organisms that cannot grow on a glucose salt medium include: 1. Fastidious organisms: Fastidious organisms, such as some pathogenic bacteria, require complex nutritional requirements. They need specific amino acids, vitamins, or growth factors to grow and cannot survive on minimal media with basic elements like glucose salt medium. Examples of fastidious bacteria include Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. 2. Obligate anaerobes: Obligate anaerobes are microorganisms that can only grow in the absence of oxygen. A glucose salt medium does not contain any reducing agents or oxygen-scavenging components that can create an anaerobic environment. Therefore, these anaerobic bacteria, such as Clostridium tetani, cannot grow on a glucose salt medium. 3. Obligate intracellular parasites: Some organisms, like obligate intracellular parasites, require a host cell for replication and growth. Examples include Chlamydia trachomatis and viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These microorganisms cannot grow on a glucose salt medium because they need a cellular environment for their survival and reproduction. 4. Organisms with specialized metabolic pathways: Some microorganisms utilize specific metabolic pathways that do not rely on glucose as their primary carbon source. These organisms may be unable to grow on a glucose salt medium due to the absence of their preferred metabolic substrates. For example, methanogens, which derive energy and carbon from methane, would not be supported by a glucose salt medium. In summary, while a glucose salt medium is suitable for the growth of many microorganisms, it is not ideal for fastidious organisms, obligate anaerobes, obligate intracellular parasites, and organisms with specialized metabolic pathways, as it does not provide their specific nutritional requirements or environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please briefly summarize this news article: Review of Louie season 3 premiere, \\"Something Is Wrong\\" Louis CK and Gaby Hoffmann in the season premiere. Spoilers for last night’s Louie below: In “Something Is Wrong,” the the season premiere of Louie, Louis CK’s alter ego protagonist bought himself a motorcycle. I’ve seen the first five episodes of the third season by now, and it’s clear that Louis CK is driving a powerful vehicle, as well, and the accelerator is jammed: after an already strong second season (#1 on my best-shows list for 2011), each episode is better than the previous one. I am beginning to worry that if it gets any better, it will break my TV. The return episode is strong enough in its own right, and plays like a kind of sampler of Louie’s strengths. I was weeping at the opening masturbation / reading glasses joke, capped off by the guilty assumption about the sales clerk at the pharmacy. (“You ain’t readin’ shit!”). There was the surreal comedy of the parking gag, with the just-ever-so-off street signs. There was the midlife-crisis and physical comedy with the motorcycle (accompanied by one of the show’s occasional montage-love-letters to Manhattan). And above all, there was the brilliant breakup exchange in the diner, with Louie’s girlfriend guessing that he wants to split, and Louie only able to confirm that she’s right–or realize that she’s right only because she brought it up?–only through his silence. From the conversation, we get that April and Louie have been a thing for a while, though he’s been hesitant to get too serious. But the genius of the scene is how the dialogue–or near-monologue–gives us the sense, just through the language, of how old and tiring this relationship is, even though we’ve just been dropped in the middle of it. (“Oh, god, why does it have to be like this? What is this, a game of relationship charades?”) It’s a fine performance by Gaby Hoffmann as April, and another good example of how well the show casts actors who look and sound like everyday Manhattanites. It may be a stretch to say that individual seasons of Louie are “about” something. But if the first season was one in which we met the character, adjusting to life after divorce (the guy we saw start crying on a date), and the second showed Louie gaining confidence as a single father and expanding the community around him, the third seems to show him putting himself out there, dating and venturing into the larger world. (Again, I’ve seen five episodes, but won’t spoil anything for you from them.) After Louie wipes out on his bike (an accident he admits to his ex-wife but is too embarrassed to relate to April), one of the last things April tells him is that he could spare them both a few years of their lives wasted by being honest about his feelings before he commits. Which is to say that getting back on that bike—literally, or metaphorically in dating—means exposing himself to the possibility of injury, either physical or emotional. It may not be painless for Louie, but it’s exciting for us. Over two previous seasons, Louis CK has built himself quite the machine here. Let’s see what this baby can do. A quick hail of bullets: * We see Louie’s ex-wife for the first time, which is quite a surprise since we’ve never seen her before and also because she’s black. (Hispanic? In any case, darker-complected than we would expect from his sister’s description of the ex in last season’s “Pregnant” as a “pasty, big-titted, black-eyed guinea bitch.” When I interviewed Louis CK last year, he said he deliberately avoided showing his character’s ex on the show at the time, and that he took care to change real-life details in any references to her, so as not to seem to depicting his actual ex-wife. I suspected when I first watched the episode that the color-blind casting was a distancing attempt for that reason–and/or an outgrowth of the fact that he’s never cared a lot about some elements of continuity. In an interview with Indiewire, his explanation is a little of both—that, he says, and he simply really liked Susan Kelechi Watson’s audition. * Speaking of continuity, or lack thereof: his niece? Not around, as far as we can see. Pamela? Still off somewhere, or out of the picture? * Having dropped a giant water jug through the roof of a car its first season, Louie now destroys one with construction equipment.

Context: Coming off their win over the Chiefs, the Broncos traveled to Foxborough, Massachusetts to face the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium. This was the 14th meeting between quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tom Brady since 2001. The Broncos jumped out to a 17-0 lead in the first quarter off three Patriots' turnovers. First, linebacker Von Miller returned a fumble 60 yards for a touchdown. Then, after another Patriots' fumble, running back Knowshon Moreno rushed for a 2-yard touchdown. Placekicker Matt Prater added a 27-yard field goal after yet another Patriots' fumble. The Broncos increased their lead to 24-0 midway through the second quarter, with Manning connecting on a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jacob Tamme. The Patriots then reeled off 31 unanswered points, 14 of which came off two Broncos' turnovers. The Patriots took the opening possession of the second half and got on the scoreboard, with Brady connecting on a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Julian Edelman. Following a fumble by Broncos' running back Montee Ball, the Patriots scored again, with running back Brandon Bolden rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. After forcing a Broncos' punt, the Patriots pulled to within 24-21 near the end of the third quarter, with Brady throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski. On the second play of the Broncos' next possession, Manning was intercepted by Patriots' cornerback Logan Ryan early in the fourth quarter, and three plays later, Brady connected on another touchdown pass to Edelman &#8212; from 14 yards out &#8212; to give the Patriots a 28-24 lead. The Broncos' went three-and-out on their next offensive possession, and the Patriots subsequently added to their lead, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Stephen Gostkowski midway through the fourth quarter. The Broncos snapped the Patriots' streak of 31 unanswered points and tied the game on their next possession, with a 10-play, 80-yard drive, culminating with an 11-yard touchdown pass from Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, sending the game to overtime. Each team traded punts on their first two overtime possessions, and after the Patriots' second punt, Broncos' cornerback Tony Carter inadvertently made contact with the football as he was trying to get out of the way of a bouncing punt, with Patriots' safety Nate Ebner recovering the fumble at the Broncos' 13-yard line. Three plays later, Gostkowski nailed the game-winning 30-yard field goal with 1:56 remaining in overtime. This marked wide receiver Wes Welker's first visit to New England, where he was a standout Pro Bowler with the team from 2007-12. Tom Brady improved his head-to-head record against Peyton Manning to 10-4, while Manning suffered his 14th career loss in 21 starts against the Patriots. Question: Which kicker made more field goals?

After a rooftop chase, where his fear of heights and vertigo result in the death of a policeman, San Francisco detective John \\"Scottie\\" Ferguson retires. Scottie tries to conquer his fear, but his friend and ex-fiancÃ©e Midge Wood says that another severe emotional shock may be the only cure. An acquaintance from college, Gavin Elster, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine, claiming she has been possessed. Scottie reluctantly agrees, and follows Madeleine to a florist where she buys a bouquet of flowers, to the Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s and the grave of Carlotta Valdes, and to an art museum where she gazes at the Portrait of Carlotta. He watches her enter the McKittrick Hotel, but on investigation she does not seem to be there. A local historian explains that Carlotta Valdes tragically committed suicide. Gavin reveals that Carlotta (who he fears is possessing Madeleine) is Madeleine's great-grandmother, although Madeleine has no knowledge of this, and does not remember the places she has visited. Scottie tails Madeleine to Fort Point and, when she leaps into the bay, he rescues her. The next day Scottie follows Madeleine; they meet and spend the day together. They travel to Muir Woods and Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, where Madeleine runs down towards the ocean. Scottie grabs her and they embrace. Madeleine recounts a nightmare and Scottie identifies its setting as Mission San Juan Bautista. He drives her there and they express their love for each other. Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower. Scottie, halted on the steps by his vertigo, sees Madeleine plunge to her death. The death is declared a suicide.

In addition to expanding on the narrative, these \\"footnotes\\" sometimes draw attention to economic/political issues in Mexico, especially the situation of the poor in rural areas of the country.The story itself focuses on two boys at the threshold of adulthood: Julio (Gael García Bernal), from a leftist middle-class family, and Tenoch (Diego Luna), whose father is a high-ranking political official. The film opens with scenes of each boy having sex with his girlfriend one last time before the girls leave on a trip to Italy. Without their girlfriends around, the boys quickly become bored.At a wedding, they meet Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the Spanish wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano, and attempt to impress the older woman with talk of an invented secluded beach called la Boca del Cielo (\\"Heaven's Mouth\\").

The adage says \\"a picture is worth a thousand words,\\" but when Leeann Lewandowski happened upon a photograph of her late mother on Facebook after her home was destroyed in Superstorm Sandy, she was speechless. \\"The first thing I see on my Timeline is my mother holding my daughter, Katie, on the day that she was born. I'm usually a very cheery person, but I absolutely crumbled,\\" said Lewandowski, a 47-year-old elementary school teacher and mother of twin 14-year-old girls from Union Beach, New Jersey. Union Beach is a small seaside community with fewer than 6,500 residents, and Sandy hit it hard, destroying nearly 200 homes and decimating the coastline. \\"It was kind of like 'The Wizard of Oz,'\\" said resident Pamela Vasquez. A hot tub was found a block and a half away from where it once sat. Remnants of wooden decks floated in the tide. Family photo albums were buried under piles where multistory houses once stood. Powerless in New Jersey post-Sandy. Jeannette Van Houten also lost her Union Beach home in Sandy, but buried among the devastation she found a calling -- to return memories of happier times to the 1.8-square-mile township by reuniting residents with the family photographs that Sandy scattered to the winds. The day after the storm, Van Houten went for a walk along the shoreline to assess the damage and she stumbled upon a photograph of a couple attending a wedding. She leaned down, picked it up and, suddenly, her mission became clear. \\"Photos are the only things that hold us to the past. My niece was murdered in 2008 and the only thing we have left of her is our photos,\\" said Van Houten. She soon started a Facebook page where she uploaded the pictures she found, hopeful that through the power of social media, residents of the small community would see them and be able to identify the faces and families in the photographs. Since she started, Van Houten has uploaded more than 2,000 photos to the Facebook page -- and she's still looking each day for more lost memories among the debris. About 60 families have reclaimed photos so far, she said. And some people, like Lewandowski and her daughters, have since joined the effort. Read more: Remembering the victims. After all, Van Houten is the reason Lewandowski saw her late mother on Facebook and broke down that day; Van Houten is the reason she got a rare memento of her mother back. \\"My mother, very much like myself, hated having her picture taken. That day, I didn't see anything but a picture of my mother holding my baby. I even posted 'Today is going to be a good day.' It's such a gift,\\" said Lewandowski. Vasquez, who also lost her home, found baby photos of her now grown children on Van Houten's Facebook page. \\"You hold your memories in your heart, but yet to be able to look back, it's amazing,\\" she said. \\"My husband's parents are both gone and we had a picture of both of them in our living room. We don't have them anymore. It's nice that somebody's out there trying to find your memories and give them back to you.\\" Paying it forward, Vasquez has also begun to take photos she finds to the police station to be uploaded to the online forum. Read more: Salvaging smeared memories in Sandy's wake. \\"You can lose your home, you can lose your possessions. Volunteers can help you get food, get shelter, get clothing, but in the end, if no one thinks of picking up the photos or the objects that were miles from where they were supposed to be, people don't feel whole,\\" said Van Houten. As more communities that were ordered to evacuate are allowed to re-enter their neighborhoods, similar initiatives have begun to pop up along the badly beaten Jersey Shore. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast. Jeannie Esti recently started the For Shore Photos Project, which asks residents and cleanup volunteers to collect photographs that were strewn about in the storm surge. Esti lives in Rhode Island now, but she grew up in Mantoloking, New Jersey, where her parents still live. Her childhood home was luckily left unscathed, but in the backyard, she found kitchen cabinets, books, even a little boy's football helmet signed by the actor and former football player John Amos. And, of course, photographs. \\"I grew up with sand in my pants in my whole life,\\" she said. \\"It's that moment where you sit back and think these could be my pictures.\\" For those without photo scanners, Esti has teamed up with local New Jersey businesses like Joe Leone's specialty food stores in Sea Girt and Point Pleasant as drop-off locations for lost-and-found photos that are then collected and uploaded to the For Shore Photos Facebook page. \\"Photography is so common and ubiquitous that we take it for granted, and we don't realize how important it is to us,\\" said Marina Berio, who heads the general studies program at the International Center of Photography. \\"It's the despair of losing part of yourself. Your very memories are being taken away from you.\\" Jenika McDavitt, a photographer who studied psychology at Yale and runs the blog \\"Psychology for Photographers,\\" agrees. \\"We as humans become habituated to our environment. We forget the way that grandma's house looked. When you find a photo that shows those things that you are habituated to and you forgot, it brings back all those memories that you forgot to stop and remember,\\" she said. When Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, Sue Weber of Erie, Pennsylvania, also recognized the power of photography and started The Picture Project. After seeing a reporter on television hold up a picture that was found in the middle of the street of a child in a dance costume, Weber had a revelation similar to Van Houten's. \\"Then it hit me -- many families on the Gulf Coast had lost their entire history in family photos due to Katrina and I should do something about it,\\" she said. Partnering with Kodak, the Biloxi Sun Herald and United Van lines, among others, The Picture Project was able to return thousands of photos to their rightful owners. Weber's revelation also came about because of the coffee table book \\"The Last Album: Eyes from the Ashes of Auschwitz-Birkenau,\\" which sat in front of her during the news report. Weber had attended a presentation at the Erie Museum by the book's author, Ann Weiss, several years prior. During a tour of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1986, Weiss discovered an archive of more than 2,000 photographs confiscated from Jewish families at the death camp. Trying to keep the family business afloat after Sandy. \\"They wanted to bring their emblem of who they were, and they wanted to remember the lives that they lived and the people that they loved. Or even, just remember the people they themselves once were,\\" said Weiss. Weiss fought red tape to obtain the pictures and after doing so, traveled around the world tracking down any survivors, family members and friends that they might belong to. Being stripped of family memories in the Holocaust is very different from losing belongings in a natural disaster, Weiss pointed out, but the end result of both is profound loss. \\"I think all photos are incredibly important because photos are the emblem of our lives. They're tangible proof that we lived, that we're here and when there's a natural disaster -- after the people and after the pets -- what's the first thing we want to save? It's always the pictures,\\" she said. \\"Pictures encapsulate our lives, our dreams, our essence of who we are.\\" Like CNN Living on Facebook.

Answer based on context: Coming off their win over the Buccaneers, the Ravens stayed at home for a Week 13 AFC North rematch with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night.  Baltimore delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback Joe Flacco found wide receiver Anquan Boldin on a 14-yard touchdown pass.  After a scoreless second quarter, the Steelers responded with kicker Shaun Suisham got a 45-yard field goal.  The Ravens would answer with a 24-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff.  Pittsburgh would get another field goal in the fourth quarter, a 19-yarder by Suisham. In the final minutes of the game, the Ravens were driving, trying to run down the clock, when Troy Polamalu sacked Flacco, forcing a fumble in the process. The Steelers recovered the fumble and returned it to the Ravens' 9-yard line. Two plays later, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to running back Isaac Redman. Baltimore tried to rally, but the Steelers' defense held on to preserve the win. How many more yards did Suisham have compared with Cundiff?","output":"To find out how many more yards Suisham had compared with Cundiff, we need to look at the field goal distances they each had.

Context: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

Here is a question about this article: Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \\"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \\"Papists\\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: What is the answer to this question: Which pope was responsible for the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception?","output":"Pope Pius IX was responsible for the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception. This occurred in 1854, roughly three hundred years after Martin Luther's time. Pope Pius IX declared the Immaculate Conception as a dogma through the papal bull \\"Ineffabilis Deus,\\" which established it as an essential belief within the Roman Catholic Church."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But Theodor Seuss Geisel---better known as the children's books author Dr. Seuss ---who came into the world on 2 March, 1904, was an unusual man. Like generations of children I was raised on his wonderful stories. But when I now read them to my children it's not just the childhood memories I enjoy. His writing is brilliant and imaginative and flows with a self-confidence as sure as the words of a Shakespeare poem. Readers ride his characteristic rhythm   with an effortless joy that cannot be matched by any other modern writer: You have brains in your head You have feet in your shoes You can steer yourself any direction you choose And will you succeed? Yes indeed, yes indeed! Ninety-eight and three-quarters percent guaranteed. Seuss's brilliant cartoons and clever words make his books a delight for adults but they attract mostly children of course. His stories teach kids moral lessons but in indirect and entertaining ways. The first Seuss book I was given was The Lorax, written just as the 60s were becoming the 70s. Seuss was ahead of his time, and in this book the dawn of concern for environmental problems are shown as the Lorax \\"who speaks for the trees\\" battles against an evil businessman who wants to destroy the forest and make goods \\"which everyone needs\\". It's not only a warning of the heavy price of environmental destruction, written well before most people had thought to worry, but it's also a smart analysis of consumer societies: \\"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\\" This is of course a moral message, but not of the kind designed to persuade the youngsters into behavior that adults want. I could go on, but hey, it's a birthday, and I'm sure you folks have some good toasts to raise for the party...

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: We live in a \\"now\\" culture. If it takes more than five seconds for a website to load, we won't view it. We want to call our friends now, even if we'll see them in 10 minutes. The \\"now\\" culture is one of convenience, and let's face it, convenience can make our lives easier.  Unfortunately, by gaining convenience, we've lost some of our patience. If you're like me, patience does not come naturally. Here are a few tips I've learned along the way to cultivate more patience in my life:      Ask yourself why you're in a hurry. If you feel rushed while going about your normal day, ask yourself why. Will the world end if you get home five minutes late? What if you stop to talk to the random people you meet each day? If you do stop to talk, you'll be amazed how much more connected you'll feel to your community. Hang around people who have patience. I had a lot less patience before I met my husband. Being around him daily has certainly given me a greater appreciation for the art of waiting. He's not only a great example of someone who lives his life patiently, but he tells me if I'm getting too anxious or impatient. If you don't know someone who's patient in your immediate circle of friends, take a class like yoga where meditation is part of the art.  _ . Sometimes you can lose sight of long-term goals in the rush towards instant gratification. Most people trying to lose weight have a hard time cutting out sugary or carb-loaded foods completely. It helps to cut these lofty long-term goals into smaller chunks. To encourage weight loss, you can slowly cut back on your calorie intake or increase your exercise regimen each week. Whatever route you take, setting those little goals will help you achieve the big ones faster. Think of the things you've gained by being patient. When all else fails, I think of the good things that have happened in my life because I waited.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.\\"?

Among them are David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust costumes and the original handwritten lyrics to Blue Monday by New Order. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said: \\"It makes perfect sense that a museum which celebrates the importance of British music and its influence on society has its home in Liverpool. \\"Music is entwined with the city's history, present and future.

Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and English language films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, Basu is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award, among six nominations. Particularly known for her work in the thriller and horror film genres, she is frequently cited in the media as a sex symbol. Bipasha Basu was born on 7 January 1979 to a Bengali family in Delhi. Her father, Hirak, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Mamta, is a homemaker. She has one elder sister, Bidisha, and one younger sister, Vijayeta. According to Basu, her name means \\"dark deep desire\\", and is also a river's name. She added \\"Due to my dusky skin, I was considered ugly in my younger years.\\"  In Delhi, Basu lived at Pamposh Enclave, Nehru Place, till the age of eight and studied at Apeejay High School. Her family then shifted to Kolkata, where she attended Bhavan's Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, located in Bidhannagar. In her school, Basu was appointed as the head girl and was fondly called 'Lady Goonda' due to her short and commanding personality. She remarked \\"As a child, I was a tomboy and I was pampered a lot, due to which I became very naughty. I used to keep a stick in my hand and straighten out all the colony boys if they acted smart. I used to be very short as a child and I was the monitor in school. When the tall boys would be up to mischief, I'd jump on their back during breaks and pull their hair and beat them up\\". Basu was enrolled in medical science studies until twelfth standard, but switched to commerce thereafter.  In 1996, Basu was spotted at a hotel in Kolkata by the model Mehr Jesia Rampal, who suggested she take up modelling. That year, she participated in and eventually won the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest (organised by Ford), thereby representing India at Ford Models Supermodel of the World contest in Miami. She later appeared in the Calida commercial with her then-boyfriend Dino Morea, which was controversial for picturing them sultrily; she had some protesters outside her house after that.

Someone once said if you find a job that you enjoy, then you won't have to work another day. I would like to work in an area where I can be more creative. I would like to be the most valuable member there. All this is possible only if I like what I do. The second one is that the area of my work  must lead me to solve some  new  and  hard problems. I would like to stay in the same area for a long time. In order for this to happen, the work must provide enough problems. More than just working to live, I enjoy making a difference and trying my best for the whole progress. I would also like to be well _ for my hard work, so I can lead a comfortable life with this hard-won money. Then I can provide the best for my family. The third important thing is that I would like to work in an area that would help other people. The work in my mind is in fields such as the army, training or management. In such areas, I can help to develop the abilities of others and bring out their best. It would be a most satisfying job to help young people to become the best that they can be. When I become old, I would like to look back with  a great  sense  of  satisfaction  that  thousands  of  people  have  become  better  persons through my work. I accept the idea that no one should make a choice of a job suddenly or quickly. He should decide what he wants to be in the long run. Then, he should decide how he works towards it. He should study the proper courses, read the books and speak to knowledgeable  persons in that field before making a job choice. A good choice will most probably lead to a better life.

Perkins quit Twitter earlier this week, following the abusive tweets. \\"I am off Twitter for a bit,\\" she tweeted on Tuesday, signing off: \\"Love and peace.\\" The presenter, who hosts BBC One's The Great British Bake Off, tweeted that some of the threats she had received included someone who \\"suggested they'd like to see me burn to death\\", while her timeline \\"has been full of blokes wishing me dead\\". She described the suggestion that she was taking the Top Gear job as an \\"utterly fabricated story\\". Clarkson was dropped by the BBC in March after a \\"fracas\\" during which he punched producer Oisin Tymon. Perkins was among several names being speculated over as possible replacements for Clarkson. Last week she was announced as being the bookmakers' favourite to replace Clarkson. Bookmakers Coral said she was the front-runner for the job, followed by Dermot O'Leary and then Jodie Kidd. Perkins fronts several other TV shows, including programmes on travel and the Edinburgh Festival on BBC Two and a Sky Atlantic Game of Thrones live discussion spin-off called Thronecast. May is currently preparing to tour a Top Gear spin-off around the UK alongside Clarkson and fellow co-host Richard Hammond. There has been no further announcement as to whether he and Hammond will continue to front the BBC show following Clarkson's departure.

Pumbaa's protest over this eventually prompts Timon to share his backstory (going way back, to before the beginning of the first movie). Timon is a social outcast in his meerkat colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his mother Ma, Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the near-death of his Uncle Max by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets Rafiki, who teaches him about \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and advises him to \\"look beyond what you see\\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon. The pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas, causing nearby animals to faint but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\", Mufasa's fight with the Hyenas, and Scar's conspiring with the hyenas.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"The given data is related to the performance of Morocco, presumably in a sporting event or a series of events, such as an international competition. The data provided mentions various types of medals won by Morocco, as well as their overall ranking in the event(s). To further elaborate on this data: 1. Morocco GOLD 2: This indicates that Morocco has won two gold medals in the event or the series of events. Gold medals are typically awarded to participants who come in first place in a particular discipline or category. This achievement highlights the hard work, dedication, and talent of the Moroccan athletes who earned these top honors. It also signifies the level of excellence they have achieved in their respective fields, which indicates that Morocco is competitive against other participating nations. 2. Morocco RANK 9: The data provides information about the overall ranking of Morocco, placing them in the 9th position. This ranking takes into account the number of medals, their types (gold, silver, or bronze), and possibly other criteria or factors, depending on the event's rules and regulations. Securing the 9th position in the overall standings showcases the success of Moroccan athletes at the event or events and reflects the nation's sports infrastructure and training facilities. It also highlights the potential for improvement and the possibility of climbing up the ladder in future competitions. 3. Morocco BRONZE 0: The data indicates that Morocco has not won any bronze medals in the event or series of events. Bronze medals are customarily awarded to athletes or teams who finish in third place in a specific discipline or category. The absence of bronze medals in the Moroccan tally suggests that their athletes either obtained better positions (such as securing gold or silver), or they faced fierce competition from other participants, narrowly missing out on the third-place finishes. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that even without bronze medals, the nation still managed to achieve a commendable ranking in the overall standings. In conclusion, the data highlights Morocco's medal count and ranking in the international sporting event or series of events. With two gold medals and a 9th place ranking, it reflects the determination and skill of Moroccan athletes and provides insights into the country's level of competitiveness on the global sports stage. The absence of bronze medals could serve as motivation for future improvements and lead to even better results in future competitions."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Write highlights for this article: The 10 golden rules to help avoid dementia have been unveiled by British scientists. From popping a fish oil pill to enjoying a glass of red wine, the simple everyday lifestyle changes can cut the risk of the disease by more than half, they say. Another recommendation is ballroom dancing - because having to remember the steps boosts brain function, say the experts. Taking up ballroom dancing or playing suduko are among the 10 simple lifestyle changes that can help stave off dementia, Scottish researchers say. Factor in eating well, exercise and enjoying life and you can significantly reduce your risk, say the experts from the University of Stirling’s Dementia Services Development Centre. They devised the 10 easy rules a a way to try and keep the debilitating symptoms of the disease. There are 800,000 people with dementia in the UK, and one in three people over 65 will die from the degenerative disease. And earlier this year, U.S. researchers warned that dementia rates will tripe by 2050 if we continue to live unhealthy lifestyles. Taking vitamins such as B6 and E. Take fish oils. Drink green tea. Drink the odd glass of red wine. Don’t get drunk. Take some physical activity. Enjoy a rich and stimulating environment. Keep your brain active. Dance. Don’t worry about life. Commenting on the 10 lifestyle recommendations, Professor June Andrews, from the University of Stirling, told the Daily Express: 'This is meant to be a cheerful list of positive things we can all do to help ourselves. They are not going to do any harm and there is research evidence that they can all help. 'We know we cannot affect the final outcome. When people are told they have dementia and it cannot be treated, that gives them the feeling there is nothing they can do. 'But if people are on that journey, the message is to live as well as you can and this list can help them do that.' Just last week, Boston researchers found that a rigorous walk could hold the key to slowing the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s in later life. A natural chemical produced by the body during exercise could one day be given as an injection to inhibit the diseases, the researchers said. The protein, called FNDC5, is produced by muscular exertion and is released into the bloodstream as a hormone called irisin. And Swedish research published earlier this month found that stress in middle age. could increase the risk of suffering dementia in later life. Some studies also show that eating fish oils, such as omega fatty acids, can slow the progress of Alzheimer's. They found conditions such as Alzheimer’s may be linked to the amount of stress experienced up to four decades earlier. Professor Andrews added that certain vitamins such as B6 and E have been shown to cut the risk of Alzheimer's. A regular glass of wine can also appears to have benefits, but the researchers point out that binge drinking has been linked to an increased risk of dementia. Drinking a regular glass of wine also has benefits but the group. warns against getting drunk, as the number of young people with dementia. caused by heavy drinking is increasing.

For this task, I will choose the movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" as it is a well-known and highly praised film. Step 2: Provide an introduction to the movie. In this step, I will briefly introduce the movie and its background, setting the context for the reader. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is a 1994 drama film directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Based on a novella by Stephen King, the movie is set in the Shawshank State Penitentiary and follows the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is wrongly convicted of murder. Step 3: Discuss the story and the characters. In this step, I will provide an overview of the main storyline and the characters, highlighting their depth and development. The movie excels in storytelling as it masterfully unfolds the tale of hope, friendship, and redemption. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is a character who maintains his innocence and displays remarkable strength, intelligence, and resourcefulness despite the harsh environment of Shawshank. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red, a longtime inmate and close friend to Andy, provides the audience with an unmatched narrative voice and emotional depth. Their relationship adds warmth and a sense of camaraderie amidst the oppression of the prison walls. Step 4: Highlight the technical aspects of the film. This step will focus on the technical aspects of the movie, such as the cinematography, music, and direction. Frank Darabont's direction and Thomas Newman's haunting score create a powerful atmosphere that resonates throughout the film.

Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set.

The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is at the height of cynical hypocrisy and bad taste, showing Diana's rich white set, which now includes the establishment, playing at concern, gorging themselves, gambling and generally behaving decadently.

Pidgeon thus became the second person , after Joshua Slocum , to do so .  - Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.  - Harry Clifford Pidgeon (August 31, 1869  November 4, 1954) was an American sailor, a noted photographer, and was the second person to sail single-handedly around the world (1921-1925), 23 years after Joshua Slocum, a professional sea captain. Pidgeon was the first person to do this via the Panama Canal, and the first person to solo circumnavigate the world twice. On both trips, he sailed a 34-foot yawl named the \\"Islander\\", which Pidgeon constructed by himself. Prior to his first trip, Pidgeon had no prior experience sailing. He accounts for his adventures in his book, \\"Around the World Single-Handed: The Cruise of the \\"Islander\\"\\" (1932). Biography. Harry Clifford Pidgeon was born 31 August 1869 on a farm in Iowa. His father, Isaac Marion Pidgeon, was married 3 times and had a total of 12 children. The family were Quakers. At the age of 15, he set out for California where he found work on a ranch. Before long, he traveled north to Alaska, where he took a raft down the Yukon River and spent some time sailing among the small islands of the southeastern Alaskan coast. Later, he returned to California and traveled and worked in the Sierra Nevada mountains, taking up a career in photography.  - Sailing Alone Around the World is a sailing memoir by Joshua Slocum in 1900 about his single-handed global circumnavigation aboard the sloop \\"Spray\\". Slocum was the first person to sail around the world alone.

There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, above sea level, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, capable of handling more cargo.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America.

Problem:Microtubule nucleation is an essential step in the formation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. We recently showed that androgen and Src promote microtubule nucleation and γ-tubulin accumulation at the centrosome. Here, we explore the mechanisms by which androgen and Src regulate these processes and ask whether integrins play a role. We perturb integrin function by a tyrosine-to-alanine substitution in membrane-proximal NPIY motif in the integrin β1 tail and show that this mutant substantially decreases microtubule nucleation and γ-tubulin accumulation at the centrosome. Because androgen stimulation promotes the interaction of the androgen receptor with Src, resulting in PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling, we asked whether these pathways are inhibited by the mutant integrin and whether they regulate microtubule nucleation. Our results indicate that the formation of the androgen receptor-Src complex and the activation of downstream pathways are significantly suppressed when cells are adhered by the mutant integrin. Inhibitor studies indicate that microtubule nucleation requires MEK/ERK but not PI3K/AKT signaling. Importantly, the expression of activated RAF-1 is sufficient to rescue microtubule nucleation inhibited by the mutant integrin by promoting the centrosomal accumulation of γ-tubulin. Our data define a novel paradigm of integrin signaling, where integrins regulate microtubule nucleation by promoting the formation of androgen receptor-Src signaling complexes to activate the MEK/ERK signaling pathway.

Summarize: The trailer, shown to thousands of fans at the Star Wars Celebration event in London, ends with a shot of Vader and his trademark heavy breathing. Director Gareth Edwards revealed James Earl Jones, who voiced Vader in the original trilogy, will be back in the new film. The veteran actor recorded his dialogue in New York last December. Edwards said recording the dialogue had been \\"like an early Christmas present\\". He described how he and his sound recordist had a \\"nerd-gasm\\" when they heard Jones say the word \\"power\\" in his deep, distinctive voice. \\"We said, 'that's great - let's do that one more time.'\\" The poster for the film shows a beach battle taking place on the planet Scarif - with the Death Star looming in the sky. Rogue One tells the story of a group of rebel fighters on a mission to steal the plans for the Death Star.

It is set before the first part of the original series, Episode IV: A New Hope. Vader's appearance had been rumoured for some time, but Lucasfilm only confirmed the Sith Lord's inclusion last month, giving no more details. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said Rogue One was going to be an \\"incredibly immersive experience\\". Edwards also introduced behind-the-scenes footage from the film during the Rogue One panel at the ExCel exhibition centre. The reel ended with British actress Felicity Jones, who plays Jyn Erso, saying: \\"May the Force be with us.\\" Jones was joined on stage by a number of cast members including Riz Ahmed, Forest Whitaker, Mads Mikkelsen and Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn, who plays villain Director Krennick, had arrived in costume - flanked by stormtroopers.  He described his character as a \\"smarter villain than most of his predecessors\\". The panel began with the host Gwendoline Christie, who played Captain Phasma in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, making reference to Thursday's terror attack in Nice. \\"Our hearts go out to people in Nice and in France,\\" she said.

A judge sentences Haley to her ultimate nightmare, attending an elite gymnastics academy run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges).Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. She made it to the World Championships, but the previous year she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics.After arriving at the school, Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and after that, she can leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts (as well as her past that she avoids talking about) causes conflicts. After getting the cold shoulder the first day at the gym, Haley realizes what she is up against.At the invitational, Haley's talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons she retired: the flaws in judging.

Hill town was full of gasoline powered vehicles, while Valley town 50 miles away, banned all gas powered vehicles and allows only electrical vehicles or horse-and-buggies.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which town emitted less carbon monoxide?  Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. The answer to this question is:","output":"Valley town emitted less carbon monoxide. This is because Valley town has banned all gas-powered vehicles and allows only electric vehicles or horse-and-buggies. Gasoline-powered vehicles release a significant amount of harmful emissions, including carbon monoxide, as a by-product of the combustion of hydrocarbons. Since Valley town does not have gasoline-powered vehicles, its carbon monoxide emissions would be significantly lower compared to Hill town, which is full of gas-powered vehicles.

(Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.The hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.There were two friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563. In 1489, the chapter founded a...

The boy preacher tells the children that they must kill everybody age 19 and over in town; leading them to found a death cult with a prime rule that, once reaching the age of nineteen, one must be sacrificed to the cult's God.Twelve years later in the year 1975, a constantly bickering couple consisting of Vietnam veteran Burt (David Anders) and his wife Vicky (Kandyse McClure) are driving along a back road near Gatlin, Nebraska, planning on celebrating their second honeymoon in California, when a boy named Joseph (Ramington Jennings) stumbles out of the roadside corn and in front of their car. Accidentally running Joseph over, Burt assesses his body and realizes the boy's throat was slashed. After wrapping and placing Joseph's body in the trunk, Burt tells Vicky to wait for him while he looks around with shotgun in hand. Among the corn, Burt finds Joseph's bloodied suitcase and takes it with him back to the car. He and Vicky drive off in search of aid, not realizing they were being watched by Isaac (Preston Bailey), the nine-year-old boy preacher and current cult leader, and his most loyal follower, the 18-year-old warrior Malachai (Daniel Newman).After hearing a group of children giving an evangelical sermon over the radio, Burt and Vicky reach an abandoned gas station before deciding to go to Gatlin after finding the phones non-functional.

Continue writing the following text. Megan was a real headache for Elena, because  OPTIONS: (A). Megan was always causing all kinds of trouble.. (B). Elena was always causing all kinds of trouble..","output":"(A). Megan was always causing all kinds of trouble. Megan was a real headache for Elena, because she was always causing all kinds of trouble. Despite being long-time friends, Elena found herself constantly in the line of fire whenever Megan managed to disrupt the peaceful balance of the world around them. It was a frustrating dynamic, one that left Elena questioning the longevity of their friendship. For instance, there were the numerous times when Megan would convince Elena to tag along for one of her infamous schemes. Some of these misadventures included sneaking into the movies without paying, taking a joyride on a neighbor's motorcycle that they had found unlocked, and even trying to shoplift a dress from a popular clothing store. Elena was always left shaking her head in exasperation whenever they somehow managed to escape getting caught, while Megan would laugh it all off as if it were the most enjoyable thing in the world. At school, Megan's antics were well-known among students and teachers alike. Her academic performance was lackluster at best, as she barely paid attention in classes, often submitting assignments late or not at all. Megan's cheeky attitude towards authority was the cause of many detentions, most of which Elena was also forced to endure because of her close friendship with Megan. It wasn't unheard of for Elena to be tasked with explaining Megan's actions to the school principal, who was rapidly losing patience with this wayward student. However, the biggest trouble Megan and Elena faced was when Megan's impulsive behavior started to creep into their personal lives. Relationships were a sore spot for the duo, as Megan's unpredictability and lack of respect for others' feelings often left a string of broken hearts in her wake. Elena, being the ever-loyal friend, was always there to pick up the pieces, consoling those who had fallen afoul of Megan's whimsical approach to love and friendship. Yet, despite all the headaches that Megan caused, Elena couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for her friend's unbridled zest for life. There were moments where Megan would display a boundless energy, working towards a goal or dream that, with her intellect if properly applied, seemed entirely achievable. It was during these brief flashes of brilliance that Elena knew she couldn't simply walk away from their friendship. This steadfast belief in Megan ultimately led Elena to continue supporting her, even when the odds seemed insurmountable. The balance between the frustration of dealing with Megan's trouble-making tendencies and the admiration for her moments of pure potential was precarious. Elena often found herself conflicted, torn between the need to protect her friend and the desire to see Megan grow and mature out of her unhelpful habits. Surely, there had to be a breaking point where everything either came together or fell apart entirely. And although Elena didn't know when that moment might arrive, she understood that she would have to be prepared for either outcome. For now, all she could do was support her friend, hoping that one day Megan would realize the consequences of her actions and accept the responsibility that came with growing up. Until that day, Elena would shoulder the burden of Megan's troubles, attempting to guide her along a path that would hopefully lead to happier times for them both."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The airline has decided not to renew the A380 plane when the ten-year contract expires next year. The news comes after Airbus more than halved its delivery target for the A380, raising fears it could slip back to making a loss from the aircraft. A Singapore Airlines spokesperson said: \\"Our first five A380s are on 10-year leases, with options to extend. The first expires in October 2017, and we have decided not to extend it. \\"For the other four, decisions will be made later.\\" But they added the airline had orders for five separate A380s with Airbus, which will start being delivered in the second half of 2017.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: Eebee and a friend explore the kitchen in one of 'Eebee's Adventures' Eebee, star of the home-DVD series \\"Eebee's Adventures,\\" doesn't sing, dance or say much on screen. And that's what his creators hope will make him a rock star with their target viewers—babies younger than 2 and their parents. Anjali Athavaley introduces us to Eebee, a colorful puppet and the star of the baby DVD series Eebee's Adventures, who's prime characteristic is that it doesn't do much on the screen. A full-body puppet the size of a 1-year-old, with spiky hair and an easy-to-pronounce name, Eebee laughs and makes baby sounds on screen. He (the character is officially gender-neutral) also plays with Cheerios, rolls a ball, takes laundry out of a basket and interacts with real-life babies and their moms and dads. Eebee marks one of the most ambitious approaches in years to the potentially lucrative but controversy-studded market of home videos for babies. The creators, New York-based Every Baby Company LLC (for which Eebee is named), want parents to watch the 10- to 15-minute episodes with their babies and imitate the activities they see. Parents need advice on how to interact with their child, says co-founder Stephen Gass, whose career includes stints as head of product development for Viacom's new media group and president of the online division at Sesame Workshop, the maker of \\"Sesame Street.\\" \\"Most parents are going to deplete their peekaboo repertoire pretty quickly,\\" Mr. Gass says. \\"What do you do then? Our goal was to be a catalyst for real-world play.\\" Eebee plays with Cheerios and rolls a ball down a ramp. His creators say they gave him spiky hair because it looked like something infants would enjoy grabbing. Many parents monitor and limit their children's \\"screen time,\\" though, and pediatricians frown upon any video-watching by babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently discourages television-viewing by children under 2 (the policy is under review). \\"The evidence is not there to support that [videos] are developmentally appropriate or educational for this age group,\\" says Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and a member of the academy's communications and media council. Studies comparing how young children learn from a parent versus video find \\"a video deficit,\\" she adds. \\"Children will always learn better from the live presentation.\\" Videos for babies under 2 are a difficult market. The viewers outgrow them, and consumer activists and pediatricians frown upon them. Here are some of the more popular series. Baby Einstein President George W. Bush praised the entrepreneur who founded the brand in his 2007 State of the Union address. Brainy Baby Has research it says suggests benefits for babies in recognizing shapes and colors. Sesame Beginnings A series of four videos starring baby versions of \\"Sesame Street\\" characters and their adult family members. It is supposed to model parent-child interaction. In recent years, critics such as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a Boston nonprofit that aims to restrict corporate marketing to children, have taken on the baby-video sector, including the popular Baby Einstein series, whose videos feature music, sounds and animal hand puppets. Activists complained to regulators about the series' implied educational benefits and the potential harms of video-viewing by the very young. Regulators didn't take action. Last year, parent company Walt Disney Co. offered refunds to Baby Einstein DVD customers, saying it did so under a long-standing customer-satisfaction guarantee. It continues to sell Baby Einstein videos and toys. Even so, Every Baby is venturing ahead with a video series it says has a positive influence on parent-child playtime. Content does matter in children's video, Eebee's makers say, and video watched by babies and parents together can have a far more beneficial effect than video used as an electronic babysitter. U.S. sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs for kids declined 3% to 400 million in 2009, excluding full-length feature films, and they are expected to shrink further as alternatives such as on-demand TV and videogames proliferate, according to Screen Digest, a London media analysis company. Still, sales of kids' video have been more stable than the rest of the DVD market. The \\"electronic babysitter phenomenon is really convenient,\\" says Jan Saxton, senior film analyst. \\"We think it's going to be one of the categories that has a long life in packaged video.\\" Every Baby has recently increased retail distribution, with Eebee DVDs, dolls and books currently sold at Nordstrom stores, Barnes & Noble and some 500 toy stores. The company wants to double sales in 2010 to 2 million. Two more DVDs are in the works, and Every Baby has extended the Eebee brand to books and toys, including a plush doll and, for 2011, \\"baby adventure kits\\" designed to help with sand play and other parent-child activities. Two Eebee smart-phone applications are in the works for next year. To create Eebee, Mr. Gass worked with Don Burton, a former head of business development at Disney's educational publishing unit. The two observed young children at play at Mr. Burton's A-Ha! Learning Center in New York, with \\"play labs\\" and \\"open-ended materials\\" such as water, light or shadows. \\"We got a much better idea of what material intrigued kids,\\" Mr. Burton says. The two derived much of Eebee's actions from what they saw the real kids do. Other marketers have tried similar approaches to video content for babies. In 2006, Sesame Workshop launched \\"Sesame Beginnings,\\" a home-video series featuring baby versions of Elmo and Cookie Monster at play with adult characters. The premise was \\"to model parent-child interaction,\\" says Rosemarie Truglio, Sesame Workshop vice president for education and research. After four releases, Sesame Workshop ended production of the series in 2007. Whether experts like it or not, plenty of babies watch television. A 2007 University of Washington study found that by three months of age, some 40% of children watch TV or DVDs regularly. \\"There are a lot of videos out there, so we have almost gone beyond the question of whether they are good or bad, and onto how people are using them,\\" says Rachel Barr, associate professor of psychology at Georgetown University. \\"Eebee's Adventures\\" is a new DVD series that features a colorful puppet Eebee and caregiver Kristy. The program aims to appeal to babies and toddlers while also serving as a primer for new parents on how to play with infants. At a recent children's book-signing in New York's Central Park, 18-month-old Lucas Novembre-Barbosa had his photo taken with Eebee. Lucas loves the DVDs, says his mother, Cathy, 37, an assistant kindergarten teacher. \\"Ever since I've put it on, he's been hooked,\\" Ms. Novembre-Barbosa says. She watches the videos with her son and has borrowed ideas, such as emptying cereal into plastic containers for him to play with. \\"I think they're good in moderation,\\" she says.

A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.   - Robert Bruce Simonds, Jr. (born 1964) is an American film producer and the Chairman and CEO of movie studio STX Entertainment. His over thirty Hollywood studio movies have generated well in excess of 6 billion in worldwide revenue, including \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" and \\"The Pink Panther\\" with Steve Martin, \\"Big Daddy\\" and \\"The Waterboy\\" with Adam Sandler, and \\"This Means War\\" with Academy Award-winning actress Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hardy.

The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Problem Child 2 is the 1991 comedy film sequel to the 1990 film \\"Problem Child\\"; a continuation of the exploits of Junior, an adopted orphan boy who deliberately wreaks comedic havoc everywhere he goes. In it, Amy Yasbeck portrays Annie Young, unlike the first one in which she portrayed Flo Healy, wife of Ben (John Ritter). It was produced by producer Robert Simonds, who also produced the first one.

The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions.  - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998.

PC Kevin Hughes, 42, is accused of making the racist comment as he pointed to three black men leaning against a wall. When challenged, he allegedly replied ‘but it’s true’ before arguing that the men were ‘closely related to chimpanzees and more closely related to Neanderthals’. His comments were alleged to have been made while he was on patrol in Newham, one of London’s most ethnically diverse areas. PC David Hair (left) and PC Kevin Hughes (right) denied their comments - overheard by a colleague - were racist. And his colleague David Hair asked a. black officer if she was staying to do overtime or ‘going home to cook. bananas', it is alleged. Kate Wilkinson, prosecutor, told. Westminster Magistrates Court that PC Hughes was on patrol with PC. Costas Dakoutros when he made the comments. Hair, of Epping, Essex, and Hughes, who met at police training school, both deny making any racist comments. Hughes allegedly made the racist remarks while in a patrol car in Green Street with three colleagues on February 22 after seeing three black men standing on the pavement, the prosecutor said. He allegedly turned to his colleague, PC Costas Dakoutros, who was in the back of the car with him, and said: 'Look at them, they look like f****** monkeys.' 'PC Dakoutros looked shocked and said ‘You can't say that',' Ms Wilkinson said. But Hughes allegedly replied: 'No, but it's true.' 'He began to deliberate that they [black people] were closely related to chimpanzees and then said they were more closely related to Neanderthals,' according to the prosecutor. Giving evidence, PC Dakoutros, who made an immediate note of the incident, said it has had a profound impact on his wellbeing. He said: 'It was horrible. I'd heard the comment and it was always playing on my mind. 'It affected me at the time. I felt I was given something that I didn't know how to deal with. I felt something should be done but I didn't know exactly what to do. I just wanted the matter taken out of my hands.' Charges: The two officers appeared in Westminster Magistrates Court where they denied making racist comments while on duty. He added: 'I stopped sleeping. I put on a bit of weight. I was generally moody. I retreated into myself a lot. 'I was kind of starting to doubt the organisation that I worked for.' PC Dakoutros described a culture of racist banter between Hughes and Hair, who were good friends. He. told the court the pair would refer to each other as 'auntie and. uncle'- using imitation Asian accents in the style of the TV show. Goodness Gracious Me, starring Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar. He. also described an incident in which the pair were on an operation with. an Asian female Special Constable and they decided not to use the term. in case she made an official complaint against them. He said: 'K [Hughes] said we can't use 'auntie' as she might complain. D [Hair] agreed. 'It backed up my initial thoughts that these two officers were aware that someone might complain if they heard it being used.' Another colleague who was in the car said he heard Hughes say: 'Black people hadn't evolved and lived in mud huts in Africa', according to Ms Wilkinson. But under questioning the officer denied being racist and said he was commenting on the way a man walked. Ms Wilkinson said: 'He said he didn't recall seeing three black males but said he saw someone with a certain gait who walked like a monkey and he had said to PC Dakoutros something about a monkey.' 'I didn't know if you were going to go into a little rant and say you were going to go home and cook bananas.' - Alleged words of PC Hair to black colleague. Hair is alleged to have made racist comments to his black colleague, PC Julia Dacres, on March 13. PC Dacres lived in south London and so would not regularly work overtime as she found it difficult to travel home late at night, Ms Wilkinson told the court. While on patrol, Hair asked PC Dacres if she was going to do any overtime, to which she sarcastically laughed and said she would. Hair then allegedly said: 'I didn't know if you were going to go into a little rant and say you were going to go home and cook bananas.' Ms Wilkinson said PC Dacres was 'stunned' by this comment and replied: 'That is a weird concoction. Is that what you had for dinner?' PC Dakoutros said when he heard the comment, he initially thought it was an ongoing joke', but 'when I spoke to PC Dacres, about it, it had obviously upset her'. Hughes was present in the police van at the time. 'PC Hughes admitted hearing the comment and said it was stupid,' Ms Wilkinson said. Hair admitted making the comment but said it was not racist because he 'could have named any food', according to Ms Wilkinson. She added: 'He does not deny the statement but asserts it was made with no racial connotation.' The prosecutor also said the pair, who worked in the North East Victim Offender Location Time team (Volt), regularly mocked Asian culture while working, which distressed some colleagues. Hughes and Hair would call each other 'aunty' and 'uncle', common terms in Asian culture for elders, using mock accents 'such as those heard on television comedy series', Ms Wilkinson said. Senior staff never challenged the pair for this, she said. The decision to charge the officers came after an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) following a referral of the complaints in April. The Met said both officers were suspended from duty on 5 April. The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

So, this story is about two police officers, Mr. Kevin Hughes and Mr. David Hair, who are in trouble for saying mean things that are not nice or kind to people who have skin a different color than theirs. They are accused of saying these hurtful things about black people and Asian people, which is a very bad thing to do because it is called being racist. Racism is when someone treats other people unfairly only because of their race, or the color of their skin. Now, these two officers are being taken to court, which is a place where people go when they do something wrong, to see if they really did say these mean things. The officers are saying that they did not say these mean things. This all happened while they were on their job as police officers, and now they can't work until it's all figured out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer.

Question 1: What is friction circle method and its uses? Question 2: Is there any method to make roads aseismic? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Before I answer the questions, let's analyze each question carefully. Question 1: What is friction circle method and its uses? This question requires me to explain the friction circle method and its applications. Step 1: Define the friction circle method. Step 2: Explain the applications of the friction circle method. Question 2: Is there any method to make roads aseismic? This question asks me to discuss if there is a way to create roads that are resistant to seismic activity. Step 1: Define what aseismic means. Step 2: Research and provide information on whether there is a method to make roads aseismic or how to increase their resistance to seismic activity. Now, let's answer the questions: Answer to Question 1: The friction circle method is a widely-used analytical technique in soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering. It is employed to analyze the stability of slopes, retaining walls, and other earth structures. The method is based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, which considers both the frictional resistance and cohesive strength of the soil. The friction circle method involves constructing a circle, wherein the diameter represents the combined effects of both the friction angle and cohesion of the soil. This circle is used to determine the limiting equilibrium of a soil mass, which indicates whether the mass will maintain its stability or experience failure. The friction circle method has several uses, such as: 1. Determining the factor of safety for slopes and embankments. 2. Analyzing the stability of retaining walls and foundations. 3. Estimating the load-carrying capacity of piles. 4. Investigating the potential for soil liquefaction during earthquakes. Answer to Question 2: Aseismic refers to a structure or design that is intended to reduce the effects of seismic activity like earthquakes. There are methods to make roads more aseismic or enhance their resistance to seismic forces. Some of these methods include: 1. Improvement of soil conditions: Compacting and stabilizing the soil underneath the roadway can help reduce potential deformation and improve overall stability during earthquakes. 2. Use of flexible pavements: Flexible pavements can better accommodate ground movements and deformations during earthquakes, reducing the potential for damage. 3. Implementing seismic isolation: Installing seismic isolation devices, such as rubber bearings and sliding isolation systems, can help reduce the impact of ground shaking on road structures like bridges and overpasses. Question 1 and Question 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 deals with a specific method in geotechnical engineering for analyzing the stability of soil, while Question 2 asks about aseismic design methods for roads."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With an estimated 400,000 residents, the Okanagan Country spans from the Thompson Plateau near Grindrod, British Columbia in the Okanagan to the Okanagan Highland near Douglas County, Washington in the Okanogan. The largest city in the Canadian portion is Kelowna, with 117,312 residents as of 2011, while the largest city in the American portion is Omak, with 4,881 residents as of 2011. The region took its current name in honor of the Okanagan term, \\"uknaqín\\". The mild climate and close proximity to lakes, rivers and mountainous regions make the Okanagan Country an outdoor recreational destination. The region's economy is dominated by the primary industries of agriculture and forestry, although economic diversification has also occurred with retirement communities and recreational tourism. The American portion is considered to be more remote than the Canadian division, with approximately 10 percent of the population.  - Yale - East was a provincial electoral district in the British Columbia legislature that appeared only in the 1894 , 1898 and 1900 elections .

Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell reportedly said it was more than likely they had used WhatsApp, but there is no evidence they did. Meanwhile, a comment from Belgian Federal Interior Minister Jan Jambon that they had used a PlayStation 4 to communicate was widely reported, but it later emerged suggestions the console had been found at the apartment of one of the attackers were false. It was also reported the PlayStation 4 used end-to-end encryption, but it does not. Encrypted products still reveal metadata - who talked to whom and for how long, and this has played a crucial role in the aftermath of events in Paris. \\"The arrests that are going on now have come from a trawl through metadata,\\" says Prof Woodward. \\"The first person is identified, and then the security services use what is called link analysis to build a picture of who they have been speaking to.\\" The British intelligence service is particularly good at link analysis, according to Prof Woodward And the Draft Investigatory Powers Bill, currently going through Parliament, would require internet service providers to hold on to this metadata for 12 months. But increasingly the security services are turning to hacking - placing malware on suspects' computers to find out what they are doing in real time. \\"If they can hack into a computer or smartphone, then they can find the key to decrypt their messages,\\" Prof Sommer says. Prof Woodward says: \\"There was an IS operative in Syria who was sucked into a Skype scam, persuaded to talk to what he thought was a pretty girl, but she was a cover to inject malware onto his machine,. \\"That was able to head off a couple of attacks.\\" For the past 20 years, there have been concerns a terrorist network could cause real disruption by attacking critical infrastructure such as air traffic control or hospitals, and Chancellor George Osborne has just announced he is going to double funding to fight cybercrime to Â£1.9bn a year by 2020. He said Islamic State militants were trying to develop the ability to launch deadly cyber-attacks, but his comments were \\"vague\\" rather than being about specific threats, according to Prof Sommer. And Prof Woodward says: \\"There are more power outages caused by squirrels than by cyber-terrorists.\\" However, the Stuxnet malicious worm believed to have targeted Iran's nuclear programme in 2009 suggests such attacks are possible. \\"These militant groups are getting much more sophisticated, and you only have to look at how they use social media to see that they are very tech-savvy,\\" Prof Woodward says. And much of the government's Â£1.9bn budget will go on finding highly skilled people to work out what militant groups might do next.

They prefer special hidden messaging systems that are harder for police and secret agents to track. This makes it hard for the good guys to stop them from planning bad things. There was confusion about how the bad guys in Paris talked to each other. Some said they used a popular app or even a game console, but those rumors were wrong. The good guys try to catch the bad guys by looking for patterns in who they talk to. They also try to sneak into the bad guys' computers to see their messages.

County Sheriff's official confirmed Tuesday that deputies recovered a stolen Rembrandt from the pastor's office of an Episcopal church in Encino. The Rembrandt sketch stolen Saturday night from the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey was recovered Monday night from Saint Nicholas Episcopal Church in the 17100 block of Ventura Boulevard, said sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. Investigators were still trying to determine how it found its way into the office of Father Mike Cooper and to verify whether it is an authentic Rembrandt. Cooper referred questions to Whitmore. The sketch titled \\"The Judgment\\" was recovered after authorities received a tip Monday evening that someone had seen the artwork on church property. Deputies went to the property and recovered the drawing, which was positively identified by its owners, the Linearis Institute, Whitmore said. No one has been arrested in connection with the theft, he said. \\"We have the Rembrandt at the station evidence lockup.... We are now seeking to authenticate it is a Rembrandt with other sources,\\" he said. Whitmore said detectives still plan to release a sketch and images of a person involved in the \\"well-thought-out, well-executed theft.\\" The 11-inch-by-6-inch quill pen and ink work dating to about 1655 was part of an exhibition staged by the Linearis Institute. Officials at the institute have not returned telephone calls. The institute is described on its website as \\"a public repository for the visual arts specializing in works on paper by great masters of the past 500 years.\\" The artwork was stolen Saturday between 9:20 and 9:35 p.m. when a curator told investigators he was distracted by a guest. \\"When the curator turned back to the Rembrandt, it was gone,\\" Whitmore said. Art experts said works by Rembrandt are some of the most popular targets for art thieves, second only to those by Picasso, because of the artist’s name recognition and the value of the pieces. Anthony Amore, chief investigator at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston and co-author of a book called \\"Stealing Rembrandts,\\" said there have been 81 documented thefts of the artist’s work in the past 100 years. One of those took place at the Gardner museum, where in 1990 a pair of thieves posing as police officers gained entry to the museum and stole 13 works of art, including three Rembrandts. The crime remains unsolved. In the majority of cases, stolen Rembrandts have been recovered, either when thieves were caught or returned the items, sometimes in an attempt to claim reward money after they were unable to sell them. Thieves find famous artworks extremely difficult to sell because of their high profiles and the publicity generated by such thefts, he said. \\"I’d be shocked if the person who stole this piece had any idea how to fence it,\\" Amore said. There are about 700 surviving drawings that experts agree to be Rembrandt’s work, said Amore’s co-author, Tom Mashberg.

To figure out the underlying pressure that drives some birds to leave home for the season,Boyle examined 379 related species of New World flycatchers  and compared their sizes,food types, habitats, migratory behaviors and whether or not they fed in flocks. To compare the birds,the researchers constructed a \\"supertree\\"  showing the exact evolutionary relationships among different species. A computer analysis then determined whether a particular species was migratory because it ran in the \\"family\\" or whether something in the bird's environment was forcing it to leave each season.Boyle and her colleagues found that food shortage was the number one issue that predicted a species' migratory behavior. \\"Food availability is the underlying pressure, not diet and habitat,\\" Boyle said. An alternative strategy that the birds use to handle food shortage is to hunt in flocks, since a group is more likely to find a new source of food than an individual. \\"If you suffer from food shortage, you have two options,\\" Boyle said.\\"You can either hunt with other birds or you can migrate.\\" Question: For what purpose does the author write the text? - Educating readers. - Informing readers. - Drawing people's attention. - Condemning the bad environment.

After sixteen years, the wait is finally over. Universal Pictures has officially announced that a movie adaptation of the spellbinding musical is set to swoop into theaters in 2019. Based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel 'Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,' the musical tells an alternative story of the Land of Oz that exists prior to the famous adventures of Dorothy and her ruby slippers. It unravels the untold tale of two young witches, Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda, the Good Witch, who meet as roommates in college and later become bitter rivals.  'Wicked' offers a fresh and unexpected perspective on the well-known Wizard of Oz narrative. The compelling plot, combined with Stephen Schwartz's unforgettable music and lyrics, has captured the hearts and imaginations of audiences worldwide, making 'Wicked' one of the most popular and enduring Broadway musicals of all time. After numerous rumors and speculations, Universal Pictures finally confirmed that they have green-lit the movie adaptation. The announcement comes in conjunction with the reveal of several key members of the creative team that will bring the musical to life on the silver screen. Academy Award-winning director Stephen Daldry, best known for his work on 'Billy Elliot' and 'The Hours,' will lead the charge in helming the project. Meanwhile, the original Broadway production's producers, Marc Platt and David Stone, will also play pivotal roles in adapting the musical for the screen. Fans of the stage production will no doubt be thrilled to learn that the original creators of the musical – book writer Winnie Holzman and composer Stephen Schwartz – have been tapped to collaborate on the screenplay, ensuring that the heart and soul of their creation will remain intact. As anticipation builds for the film's release, rumors surrounding the casting process have started to swirl. Given the iconic nature of the lead characters, Elphaba and Glinda, the casting choices will be met with great expectations.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"A brown dog chews on an orange ball.\\", is the sentence \\"A dog chews on a ball.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"A dog chews on a ball.\\" is indeed a true sentence based on the initial sentence, \\"A brown dog chews on an orange ball.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of why this statement is accurate: In the original sentence, \\"A brown dog chews on an orange ball,\\" we are given specific information about the dog and the ball. The dog is described as brown, and the ball is described as orange. The sentence describes an action where the brown dog is engaged in chewing the orange ball. The second sentence, \\"A dog chews on a ball.\\" is a more general statement derived from the original sentence. Let's analyze the components of both sentences to understand their correlation: 1. Both sentences mention a dog performing an action. In the first sentence, it is specified as a \\"brown dog,\\" while in the second sentence, the dog's color is not mentioned. By leaving out the color of the dog, the second sentence still retains the essential information about a dog being involved in the situation. 2. The action performed by the dog in both sentences is \\"chews on.\\" This implies that the dog is actively biting or gnawing on an object. The consistency of the action in both sentences confirms the interrelation between the two sentences. 3. The object of the action, in both cases, is a ball. The first sentence specifies the ball as being \\"orange,\\" while the second sentence does not provide this detail. However, the simplified statement still communicates the core meaning by mentioning that the dog is chewing on a ball. By removing the specific attributes of the dog and the ball, the second sentence distills the central action taking place in the original statement. This simpler sentence conveys the fundamental meaning of the original sentence by focusing on the key elements of the dog's action (chewing) and the object of this action (the ball). In summary, based on the given information in the original sentence, \\"A brown dog chews on an orange ball,\\" we can reasonably conclude that the sentence \\"A dog chews on a ball.\\" is a true statement. While it omits specific details about the color of the dog and the ball, it retains the essential information reflecting the primary action taking place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Actually, all you need to do is buy some nice cat furniture and have it in place by the time you bring it into your home. The first thing that you should prepare is a cat house. Two to three feet off the ground is the best height. If you don't have enough room for a cat house, a cat bed is also a nice choice. Once you have a nice spot where your cat can go to feel safe, then it's time to get cat furniture that offers your pet a nice place to play. One nice choice is cat trees. Scratching posts   are another great idea if you are short in space, but still want to give your cat a nice place where it can claw   at instead of your own furniture. If you're looking for a great way to shop for cat furniture, simply turn on your computer and do some online shopping. In no time will you be able to skim all the offerings from many online stores. What's great is that you can easily compare products and their prices, so you can get what you want at the best possible price. And, probably the nicest thing about online shopping is that your purchases may be shipped right to you, so you don't have to waste time making a trip to the store.

POST : I (33 M) have been dealing with ongoing issues with a colleague who I will refer to as G (40 F) at work. I am having trouble letting go of the situation and don't feel like I am in the wrong, but would like some validation in my opinion or to hear differing thoughts regarding the situation.  Just some background, this colleague and myself have been with the company for around 9 years and have worked together for 4 of those years. We ate lunch together daily, often times separately from people within our department and regularly had personal conversations regarding our families. I felt it was a very good relationship, which is likely why I am having issues with what the situation has degraded too. The company I work for is going through a major expansion and my entire department as well as others has been moved multiple times. One of the more recent moves, paired myself and G in a rather small cubicle. Everyone in the department was in a similar situation, some had more space, some had less, but for the most part was about equal. G was vocally upset regarding the closeness of our seating situation and informed myself, others in the department and our direct report of her unhappiness. I don't know if G ever asked to officially move, but there really wasn't any space to move to even if she had made a request. I was a little hurt that she would be that upset to share a cubicle with me, but I saw her point of view as it was close proximity and thought if was a good cubemate she may be more comfortable. As time went on the situation escalated as she became more vocal and began telling individuals in other departments of her discomfort, many of whom I did not know. I felt as if these people were looking at me like I was behaving inappropriately towards G. It was very uncomfortably for me, but I didn't want to ask someone that was genuinely uncomfortable to not voice their discomfort. I informed G that her saying this bothered me and asked if I could do anything better or different that might alleviate her discomfort. She told me there wasn't anything I could do and that it was just a proximity issue and that it wasn't personal. While I was still uncomfortable, I trusted her and believed she was not being malicious or attempting to make me look bad and opted to let it go and not make a big deal about the situation. After approximately 8 months of us sharing a cubicle, it was time for my department to move again. The week before we were scheduled to move, G asked if I wanted to go out for lunch, I had made previous lunch plans and couldn't go, which is what I informed her. I then saw her go and ask others in the department about going out for lunch, but they all had other plans as well. I felt bad because she and I usually got lunch together and it looked like she was going to have to eat alone, so I recommended G check and see if a friend of hers whom we regularly met for lunch was available, G responding by stating that was a weird and creepy thing to say. I often reminded her to text this friend when we went to lunch and I didn't view my recommendation as any different than that reminder. I had never been referred to as weird and creepy and didn't know what to do, so I just went to my lunch obligation without responding. The more I thought about it, the more it bothered me, two days after she referred to me as weird and creepy, I brought it up again, thinking she would talk about how it was a crazy day and that I caught her at a bad time, or that it was a miscommunication, something along those lines. Instead, she loudly and angrily referred to me as weird and creepy again, I tried to explain that I just felt bad and didn't want her to feel excluded, but she just kept loudly stating that it was weird and creepy, over and over. G was saying this loud enough that another colleague walked over to mediate and try to calm the situation, but he was unable to do so and I felt so humiliated, that I just stopped talking, wondering what I did wrong and hoping no one else would hear what she was saying. No one wants to be thought of as weird and creepy and to be told that by someone at work whom you trust was truly awful. We still had a few more days of sitting in the shared cubicle, I didn't understand why she spoke to me that way and wanted to talk about it, but the way she went off on me was so embarrassing, that I didn't know how to act, so I just put on headphones and focused on work. Over the course of the next few days, G acted like nothing had happened and I couldn't believe it. How could you say something like that, never talk about it and pretend like nothing had happened? I just wanted her to acknowledge that it was wrong or show some sign of caring that she hurt me, but she never did and the last day we sat next to each other was not a good one. I went to work and moved all of my belongings out of our shared cubicle early, G later mentioned to me how she had to wait for facilities to help her move, but I feel like she made this comment expecting me to offer to help. I did not offer, but rather told her that sitting next to her was not a good experience for me, packed up the remainder of my things and went to my new work area.   The new area we moved to is much larger, with everyone having their own space. About a month after moving, I noticed G spending a lot of time at the cubicle of another colleague, whom she does not share work responsibilities with. I likely would not have noticed, but this particular colleague sits adjacent to me, so I can't help but see when she goes to his cubicle. On multiple occasions, I have seen her sitting on his desk, much closer than what we sat at our cubicle, which had been a major issue for her. I overheard a conversation, where the same colleague asked her about lunch plans, specifically where she went to lunch and he was not told he was creepy or weird like I was previously. I can't help but view this as highly personal now. I feel like I was spoken about in a derogatory manner to colleagues and that I was called hurtful names, not because of anything I did, but because she had an issue with me the whole time and I was just too foolish to notice. I am so disappointed with myself for just sitting there while she spoke in what I now feel was a derogatory manner about me. I am so angry that I didn't yell back when she called me hurtful names, I wish I had so badly and I don't know how to let it go. I hoped time would heal all wounds, but it didn't, every time she goes to the other colleagues cubicle, it feels like an insult to me. I went to our direct report and informed her (40 F) of what occurred. She spoke to G regarding the issue and scheduled a meeting, at my request, to address the situation. The meeting went very poorly, G did not take it seriously, informed me I was only taking issue with her due to her gender and repeatedly threatened me with going to HR. I do not handle confrontations well and could have handled it better. Some of the meeting going poorly is most definitely my fault, but I strongly believe the fault is mostly hers. At the conclusion of the meeting, my direct report sat separately with each of us. My boss informed me that those threats were inappropriate and that nothing would come of it, that she believed me and other people had come forward with work related issues regarding G. My direct report scheduled another meeting two weeks later, but before the second meeting could occur, G suffered a tragic lose in her family and went on bereavement for 2 weeks. I have lost people in my life and felt horrified that I could in anyway worsen a already awful situation. My direct report informed me, that the second meeting would be canceled and that another one would be scheduled approximately 5 weeks after G returns from bereavement. I told my direct report that a time frame wasn't necessary, to use her judgement and schedule a meeting when she felt G was up to it. That was approximately 3 months ago and nothing has been scheduled or spoken about since then. I still feel the same as I did previously, I just want G to explain why she felt it was necessary to act like that and acknowledge that what she said was hurtful and that she should have addressed the situation differently. I am angry all the time at work and everyday I think about confronting her, creating a scene, forcing her to address it. But another part of me remembers how we used to stop for coffee and that I genuinely did enjoy her company. I think about how G just suffered a lose and I want to give her a hug and offer support, but I believe with all my heart that she thinks I'm creepy and weird. And that she is uncomfortable to be around me. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable or to worsen any situation. It has now been approximately 6 months, since she referred to me as creepy and weird and I just can't let it go, I think about it every day. At this point am I now the asshole for not moving on with my life?  Student:","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: WASHINGTON – After saying there was no evidence the two had ever met, the White House acknowledged Thursday that President Obama once lived for a few weeks with his uncle, Onyango Obama, a Kenyan who was in the United States illegally and faced possible deportation.      The president met his father’s half-brother when he moved to the Boston area to attend Harvard Law School and stayed with him until his apartment was ready, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. After moving out, Obama saw his uncle, known as Omar, once every few months until he graduated.      “The president has not seen Omar Obama in 20 years and has not spoken with him in a decade,” Carney said.      The update follows Onyango Obama’s statement in court this week that the president had lived with him. The elder Obama was in court for a deportation hearing following a drunken driving arrest. He won status as a legal permanent resident. He came to the United States in 1963 on a student visa that expired in 1970, and he has lived in the country illegally ever since.      PHOTOS: 2013's memorable political moments      The Boston Globe reported last year that the White House said the president had never met his uncle. White House aides say they actually told the Globe that there was no record of the two having met.      On Thursday, Carney said no one at the White House had actually asked the president if he’d come face to face with his uncle before making that statement to the press.      “Back when this arose, folks looked at the record, including the president’s book, and there was no evidence that they had met,” Carney said. “Nobody spoke to the president.”      When the issue came up again this week, Carney said, he personally took the question to the president.      “The president said that he, in fact, had met Omar Obama when he moved to Cambridge for law school, and that he stayed with him for a brief period of time until his apartment was ready,” Carney said.      After that, aides say, uncle and nephew saw each other once every few months while the president was in Cambridge, and then gradually fell out of touch after the president graduated from law school.      Carney said there was “absolutely zero interference” by the White House in Obama’s legal case.      Follow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook      christi.parsons@latimes.com      Twitter: @cparsons ||||| President Obama acknowledged on Thursday that he lived with his Kenyan uncle for a brief period in the 1980s while preparing to attend Harvard Law School, contradicting a statement more than a year ago that the White House had no record of the two ever meeting.      Their relationship came into question on Tuesday at the deportation hearing of his uncle, Onyango Obama, in Boston immigration court. His uncle had lived in the United States illegally since the 1970s and revealed in testimony for the first time that his famous nephew had stayed at his Cambridge apartment for about three weeks. At the time, Onyango Obama was here illegally and fighting deportation.      On Thursday, a White House official said the press office had not fully researched the relationship between the president and his uncle before telling the Globe that they had no record of the two meeting. This time, the press office asked the president directly, which they had not done in 2011.      Advertisement - Continue Reading Below      “The president first met Omar Obama when he moved to Cambridge for law school,” said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. “The president did stay with him for a brief period of time until his apartment was ready. After that, they saw each other once every few months, but after law school they fell out of touch. The president has not seen him in 20 years, has not spoken with him in 10.”      The White House said Obama’s immigration case was handled “without any interference from the president or the White House.”      Onyango Obama’s immigration case raised numerous concerns about a potential conflict of interest after his arrest in August 2011 for drunken driving in Framingham. The arrest revealed is outstanding deportation orders and his relationship to the president.      Shortly after his arrest, he told an officer, “I think I will call the White House.”      Obama is the second relative of the president’s father to face deportation to Kenya since he took office.      Zeituni Onyango, Obama’s sister, won asylum in 2010 after a federal official disclosed days before the president’s historic election in 2008 that she was living illegally in the United States, in Boston public housing.      President Obama had written in his memoir, “Dreams from My Father,” that he had met Zeituni Onyango, his aunt.      But his relationship with his uncle, nicknamed Omar, was less clear.      In November 2011, a White House spokesman said he had no record of the two ever meeting. The Washington Post had also reported that scholars believed the two had never met.      The White House never moved to correct the record, until the president’s famously private uncle took the witness stand in Boston immigration court two days ago.      Onyango Obama, now a 69-year-old liquor store manager in Framingham, said he had helped numerous students and had relatives in the United States, including his nephew, Barack Obama.      He said the president had stayed with him at his Cambridge apartment for three weeks when he came to attend Harvard Law School in the 1980s.      “It’s a good thing to let your nephew stay with you,” he said after the hearing, adding that in his family, “your brother’s kids are your kids as well.”      The president’s father, Barack Obama Sr., had helped Onyango Obama come to America in 1963 to attend an elite boys’ school in Cambridge. But Obama testified that he could not afford the tuition after the first year and graduated instead from public school in Cambridge. He said he went on to earn a degree in philosophy from Boston University, but the university would not confirm that.      On Tuesday, immigration Judge Leonard I. Shapiro granted Obama legal residency based on what he said was his good moral character and a section of federal law that allows him to get a green card because he arrived before 1972.      The president’s father, Barack Obama Sr., and his family were rarely in the president’s life. Obama Sr. died in a car crash in 1982. The president was raised by his mother’s family. |||||","output":"The White House has acknowledged that President Obama once lived for a few weeks with his uncle, Onyango Obama, a Kenyan who was in the United States illegally and faced possible deportation.

But the woman's tweets—including an image of the bloodied body of a child—betrayed a new level of fear in recent days as she warned that bombs were falling near her home. On Sunday, her tweets became more panicked. \\"The army got in, this could be our last days sincerely talking,\\" she wrote, per NBC News. \\"Under heavy bombardments now, can't be alive anymore. When we die, keep talking for 200,000 still inside. Bye,\\" she added. A few hours later she tweeted a photo of Bana covered in dust, explaining she \\"almost died\\" when the family's home was bombed. \\"In between death and life now, please keep praying for us,\\" reads the most recent tweet, sent around 10am local time Monday.

After both teams punted on their opening drive, the Raiders reached the Patriots 31 and struck first blood on a 49-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. After both teams punted again, the Patriots embarked on a 15 play, 84-yard drive, converting four third-downs,  and scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski midway through the second quarter to take a 7-3 lead. The Raiders punted on their next drive, and Marquette King punted only 22 yards to midfield. With the great field position, the Patriots drove all the way to the Raiders 2, but their red zone struggles continued, and they settled for a 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving them a 10-3 lead at halftime. Strong defense continued in the second half. The Raiders drove deep into Patriots territory early in the second quarter, but could only score on a 37-yard field goal by Janikowski. Following a Patriots punt, the Raiders drove from their own 14, to the Patriots 37, but a false start penalty on guard Donald Penn made it 3rd-and-15, and then Carr completed a 13-yard pass to James Jones to the Patriots 29, bringing up a 4th-and-2. The Raiders decided to settle with Janikowski's 47 yard field goal, making the score 10-9. Matthew Slater returned the ensuing kickoff 26 yards to the Patriots 41. With the good field position, the Patriots drove to the Raiders 2 again, but were once again held out of the end zone, and increased their lead to 13-9 on another 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After the Raiders went three-and-out, the Patriots marched 63 yards culminating with Gostkowski's 36-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 16-9 midway through the fourth quarter. The Raiders, though, couldn't muster up any offense against the Patriots and they went three-and-out again, but the Patriots failed to put the game away and punted. In just three plays the Raiders reached Patriots territory, but two plays later, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 30-yard line, Carr threw an incomplete pass seemingly bringing up a do-or-die 4th down, but Ryan was called for pass interference moving the ball to the Patriots 6-yard line. On the very next play, Darren McFadden scored on a 6-yard touchdown run, but the score was nullified by a holding penalty on Raiders left guard Gabe Jackson. On the next play, Carr's pass attempt was tipped and intercepted by Vince Wilfork with 0:51 seconds left, which sealed the win for the Patriots. Tom Brady had his best game to date, despite being pressured relentlessly by the Oakland defensive line, including being sacked twice, completing 24 of 37 passes for 234 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. The running game struggled, with Ridley leading the team with only 54 yards on 19 carries. Julian Edelman was the leading receiver for either team, with 10 catches for 84 yards. Rob Gronkowski continued to slowly work himself into the offense catching only 3 passes for 44 yards, but also caught the only touchdown. Derek Carr had a sub-par day, going 21 of 34 for only 174 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. Both defenses were spectacular holding the opposing offense to under 300 yards of offense (241 for the Raiders, 297 for the Patriots). With the win the Patriots advanced to 2-1 and Brady won his 150th career game, 3rd most by a starting quarterback in NFL history. Which player kicked the fifth longest field goal?","output":"Sebastian Janikowski kicked the fifth longest field goal in this game. He scored on a 47-yard field goal, which made the score 10-9. He also scored field goals of 49 and 37 yards during the match."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Question: What does Sam's daughter place on the grill? Movie title: Butterfly Effect: Revelation Movie plot: Sam Reide (Chris Carmack) witnesses a woman killed, then wakes up in an ice-filled bathtub, his vitals being monitored by his sister Jenna (Rachel Miner). It is revealed that Sam can travel back to any time and location during his lifetime (occupying his body of that time in his life), needing only to concentrate on where and when he wishes to arrive. He has helped the local police capture criminals under the guise of being a psychic. We learn that Sam pays his sister's rent and buys her groceries, and that she rarely leaves the apartment and lives in squalor in a run-down section of Detroit.That night, Elizabeth (Sarah Habel), the sister of Sam's murdered girlfriend Rebecca (Mia Serafino), arrives at Sam's apartment. She believes that the man about to be executed for her sister's murder, Lonnie Flennonds (Richard Wilkinson), is innocent, and she offers to pay Sam to find the real murderer. Sam turns her down, but goes to speak with the man who tutored him on time travel, Goldburg (Kevin Yon), who reminds him of the cardinal rules: he's not to alter his own personal past, nor travel in time with his body left unsupervised. We learn that a fire that claimed the lives of Sam and Jenna's parents had claimed Jenna's life, but Sam altered time so that their parents died instead. After Goldburg's departure, their buxom bartender Vicki (Melissa Jones) seductively offers Sam a buttery nipple; he and Vicki have sex, but upon seeing Rebecca's photo, he cannot continue.Sam changes his mind and agrees to help Elizabeth out. He tries to help Lonnie without time-traveling, but Lonnie refuses the help, believing Sam to be the culprit. Frustrated, Sam travels back to June 1998. He first runs into a drunk Elizabeth, telling her to stay in her locked car. He goes into Rebecca's bedroom to find her already dead; while there, Elizabeth is attacked from her backseat.

To start, you both should try writing some lyrics independently, and then we could see what matches up or complement each other's ideas. Chris: That's a cool idea. We'll definitely give that a try. Jay: As for the music production aspect, you'll need a strong beat to carry the song, but it shouldn't steal the spotlight from your voices. I can help with that. We can experiment with different sounds and instruments to find the perfect beat for your song. Dave: That sounds great. We're really excited to see what we can come up with together. Jay: It's important to remember that creating a great R&B song isn't just about the lyrics and the beat – it's also about how you both use your voices.

Article:","output":"Title: Independent Review Author Expresses Hope for UK Government Support on Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon Project Introduction: Charles Hendry, author of an independent review into the planned Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project, says he remains hopeful that the UK government will provide backing for the scheme. The ambitious project is expected to harness tidal energy, serving as a groundbreaking advancement in renewable energy sources in the country. Background on the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon Project: The Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon is a proposed energy project designed to capture tidal energy and generate electricity. The project, which is estimated to cost approximately £1.3bn, involves building a 320-megawatt (MW) tidal lagoon with 16 underwater turbines, around an 11 km sea wall in Swansea Bay. If successful, it would be the world's first tidal lagoon power plant and could potentially provide clean electricity for more than 150,000 homes in the United Kingdom. Independent Review Findings: Charles Hendry was assigned to lead an independent review into the feasibility and potential benefits of the Tidal Lagoon project. The review's findings, which were published in January 2017, concluded that the project would bring \\"significant economic opportunity\\" and provide a long-term energy source. Hendry stated: \\"I believe the project would help provide the energy security that is required over the coming decades, whilst delivering important advantages like reduced carbon emissions and job creation.\\"  UK Government Stance: The UK government has not yet reached a decision on whether to financially support the project, but Hendry's expressions of optimism offer some reassurance for proponents of the scheme. The tidal lagoon project, if approved, could set a precedent for future renewable energy projects not only in the UK but around the world. Public Support and Future Implications: The Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project has garnered widespread public and industry support. Many proponents argue that the project would be a major step towards achieving the UK's goal of reducing carbon emissions and generating a significant portion of its energy from renewable sources. Moreover, the initiative could lead to the development of associated industries, injecting an economic boost into the region and creating high-quality job opportunities for locals. Conclusion: As the author of the independent review, Charles Hendry remains optimistic that the UK government will see the long-term benefits and potential of the groundbreaking Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project. If supported, the project has the potential to revolutionize renewable energy generation and contribute considerably to the UK's future energy security and economic prosperity. The world eagerly awaits the UK government's decision, as it could potentially pave the way for a new era of renewable energy projects globally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 15-year-old girls were dressed in elegant evening gowns and escorted to the ball held in a Copacabana dancehall by members of the Pacifying Police Unit from their community. These police units have been instrumental in reclaiming slums that were previously ruled by drug-dealing gangs. The community came together to make this event a reality: the girls' hair and makeup were done by volunteers, and their beautiful dresses were loaned by a formal wear shop. Debutante balls, which mark a girl's transition from childhood to adulthood, are a time-honored custom among upper-middle-class and wealthy Brazilian families. However, these young ladies from the favela slum would typically not have the means to celebrate this milestone in such a grand manner. This extraordinary event helped build goodwill between the residents of pacified favelas and the police officers who patrol them. The group debutante ball was a momentous occasion for the teenage girls and their families, as well as the police officers who attended to share in the celebration of these young women's transition into adulthood. Throughout the evening, touching moments were captured in photographs: girls exiting police cars and taking the hand of the officer who patrols their neighborhood, police officers kissing the hands of their charges, and the beautiful debutantes posing with the police for a group picture, among many others. With the generous support of various community members, the debutante ball became a reality for these girls from the Santa Marta favela, proving that the people in this community can come together to make a difference and create unforgettable memories for everyone involved. This inspiring event not only provided a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the young women but also fostered a sense of unity between the community, the girls, and the local police, creating a powerful bond that will last much longer than just one night. The group debutante ball organized by the Pacifying Police Unit is a shining example of how a caring community can transform someone's life and give them a memory to cherish forever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His legacy as one of Arizona's most influential and important political figures was already without question,\\" Ducey said. \\"But he did return and I remain deeply grateful for his willingness to step up and serve again when Arizona needed him.\\"      The new appointed senator must be a Republican, according to state law, because McCain won the term as a Republican in 2016. But beyond that, the Arizona GOP is divided over the best choice for the appointment.      While McSally brings experience, connections and name identification from her recent statewide campaign, she also became the first Republican to lose a Senate race in the state in three decades when Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema defeated her by 2.4 percentage points. Some Arizona Republicans have questioned the McSally campaign's decision-making and how far behind Ducey she ran as the governor coasted to reelection, casting doubts on whether she would be the best choice for an appointment.      Adams, who led the state House and narrowly lost a Republican primary for Congress before joining Ducey's office, has strong connections with the donor community in Arizona. But he has never run a statewide campaign. And Montgomery, who has been Maricopa County attorney since 2010, has no federal or statewide campaign experience.      But Montgomery has been elected multiple times in Maricopa County, where he turned aside a well-funded challenger in 2016 even as Republican Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio lost his reelection race. Though Maricopa — Arizona's largest county and home to Phoenix — is a traditional Republican stronghold, Sinema defeated McSally by more than 4 percentage points there, a significant factor in her victory.      Dan Eberhart, a Phoenix-based Republican donor, said there is \\"momentum\\" in the donor community for an \\"anybody but McSally\\" appointment to the seat.      \\"Donors are quietly whispering in Gov. Ducey's ear that Martha McSally had her chance and came up a little short,\\" Eberhart said.      Barrett Marson, a veteran Republican strategist who ran a pro-McSally super PAC during the Senate race, said he expected the choice would come down to Adams or McSally.      \\"Each has incredible upsides and each frankly have some downsides,\\" Marson said, pointing to McSally's recent loss and Adams' lack of statewide experience. He said the appointment would likely be decided based on who would have the best chance to hold the seat in the 2020 special election, when Democrats are expected to make a strong challenge, and again in 2022 when the seat is up for a full term.      \\"You need to give a person a good head start,\\" Marson said.

Ducey is required under law to name another Republican to the seat. A replacement to the Senate seat \\"will be announced in the near future,\\" according to the Governor's Office.      Kyl wrote a letter dated Dec. 12 to Ducey, informing him of his resignation. The letter was hand-delivered to the Governor's Office late Thursday afternoon.      \\"Thank you for appointing me to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy created by John McCain's death,\\" Kyl wrote. \\"It has been an honor and a privilege to again serve the people of Arizona.      \\"When I accepted your appointment, I agreed to complete the work of the 115th Congress and then reevaluate continuing to serve.

Therefore, I will resign from the U.S. Senate effective 11:59 p.m. EST December 31, 2018.\\"      Kyl succeeded McCain to the seat in September, after McCain's Aug. 25 death, with the understanding that he would serve at least until the end of the year and possibly until 2020, when the seat was on the ballot again. It became clear in recent weeks, as Kyl was hesitant to discuss his future in the Senate, that he would be leaving.      Kyl, who served alongside McCain during his 18 years in the U.S. Senate, retired from the chamber in 2013 after rising to become the second-highest-ranking Republican senator.

Doug Ducey announces his appointment to the late Sen. John McCain's Senate seat during a press conference at the state Capitol in Phoenix on Sept. 4, 2018. (Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic)      There is intense interest from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, for Ducey to appoint outgoing Rep. Martha McSally, the Republican who lost to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema for Arizona's other U.S. Senate seat. Sinema will be sworn into office Jan. 3.      Republican donors spent millions of dollars McSally's election effort and likely want to see that investment pay dividends. Ducey and McSally met recently, but it is unclear if there was discussion about a Senate appointment.      Other names have been mentioned as well, including Ducey's former chief-of-staff, Kirk Adams, and state Treasurer Eileen Klein.      Ducey will have to weigh pressure from power players in the White House and on Capitol Hill against advice by friends, staffers and other voices in Arizona.      It is not known if Ducey has discussed his next appointment to the seat with McCain's widow, Cindy McCain.      Martha McSally met with Cindy McCain Friday afternoon at her north Phoenix home, according to Republicans familiar with the conversation.      In the meeting, McSally apologized for not mentioning the senator’s name during President Donald Trump's signing of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 2019. McSally did not use McCain's name in discussing the act when it was signed in August.      Cindy McCain expressed her appreciation for the apology and conveyed the importance of her late husband’s legacy and his service to Arizona, they said.      The two women did not speak directly about the Senate appointment, the Republicans said.      The meeting lasted about 30 minutes.      Follow the reporter on Twitter and Facebook.

The basic unit of pressure is the newton per square meter (N/m2). This combined unit is redefined as a pascal (Pa). One pascal is not a very large amount of pressure. A more useful unit of pressure is the bar, which is 100,000 Pa (1 bar = 100,000 Pa). Other common units of pressure are the atmosphere (atm), which was originally defined as the average pressure of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level; and mmHg (millimeters of mercury), which is the pressure generated by a column of mercury 1 mm high. The unit millimeters of mercury is also called a torr, named after the Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli, who invented the barometer in the mid1600s. A more precise definition of atmosphere, in terms of torr, is that there are exactly 760 torr in 1 atm. A bar equals 1.01325 atm. Given all the relationships between these pressure units, the ability to convert from one pressure unit to another is a useful skill.

Title: Children of Men Movie plot: In 2027, after 18 years of global human infertility, civilization is on the brink of collapse as humanity faces extinction. The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death, as the group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house. Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, as Julian had told her to trust only Theo. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the \\"Human Project\\", a supposed scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing infertility; however, Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is later voted as the new leader of the Fishes. Later that night, Theo eavesdrops on a meeting of Luke and other Fishes.

You should answer the question using the information from the passage. Input: passage: Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of beta oxidation inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.  question: do fatty acid synthesis and degradation occur in the same location of the cell?

Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz.  I am facing a new situation today: David wants to categorize animals according to the sound waves they can hear.

The nearest town to the base, Killeen, has one house of worship for every 245 residents, according to the Austin American-Statesman, and attendance at many appeared to be up. \\"We’re here to provide extra comfort in a time of trial,\\" said a greeter at one chapel. Nidal Malik Hasan, who allegedly killed 13 people and wounded dozens Thursday, remains in critical condition and has been taken off a ventilator. An FBI spokesman was unable to confirm whether Hasan has been charged, the San Antonio Express-News reports.","output":"Title: Fort Hood Community Prays for Hasan's Family, Seeks Comfort in Houses of Worship In the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, church attendance surged on Sunday, as residents sought solace and spiritual guidance in their houses of worship. This tight-knit community, still reeling from the loss of 13 individuals and the injury of many more in the hands of alleged shooter Major Nidal Malik Hasan, came together to pray not only for the victims but also for Hasan's family. As churches in the town of Killeen filled with mourners and seekers of comfort, the spirit of unity and empathy was distinctly tangible. Killeen, known to hold one house of worship for every 245 residents, according to the Austin American-Statesman, teemed with people attending church services. Many churches in the area reportedly experienced an increase in attendance numbers as residents sought comfort in numbers and faith in the shadow of this tragic event. Volunteers and greeters at various chapels extended their warm embrace as they guided people further into the sanctuaries for consolation and fellowship. At one of the local services, the chaplain's unexpected appeal captured the essence of the community's resilience and compassion. He implored the congregation to remember the Hasan family amidst the shock, grief, and anger. \\"Lord, we pray for Major Hasan's family, who find themselves in a position no one wants to be in—to try and explain the unexplainable,\\" he said. By including Hasan’s family in their prayers, the community displays a truly transformative empathy, standing as a testament to the power of faith in even the darkest of times. It echoes the community's understanding that the family of the alleged shooter is also grappling with their own anguish and unanswered questions. Hasan, who is accused of the mass shooting that took place on Thursday, remains in critical condition and has been taken off a ventilator. It is yet unclear whether he has been charged, as a representative from the FBI was unable to confirm this information, according to the San Antonio Express-News. While the full extent of Hasan's actions and motives remains to be uncovered, the town of Killeen and the surrounding Fort Hood community have chosen to turn their attention to their faith and support system within their churches. By prioritizing unity and compassion, the community serves as an inspiring example in the face of unimaginable hardships. In times of deep heartache, perhaps it is communities like these that demonstrate the very best of our human potential. The Fort Hood community, grappling with a devastating tragedy, has found their solace in the power of prayer, the company of one another, and the understanding that even the families of those who have caused them immense pain seek the same healing comfort in times of despair. Churches in Killeen and Fort Hood will continue to provide a safe haven for anyone who needs a place to grieve, find solace, or seek answers, upholding the pillars of empathy and unity in these trying times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This majestic bird is often said to be humankind's last line of defense against an ancient, malevolent threat called the Dark Nexus. When the Dark Nexus unexpectedly begins to awaken from a centuries-long slumber, it falls upon a disillusioned young man, an aspiring warrior, and an enigmatic wanderer to unravel the mystery of the Great Eatlon, and seek its help in order to save their world. Act I: In the sprawling city of Arandor, a young man named Aiden dreams of excitement and adventure, feeling stifled by the monotony of his everyday life. Working as an apprentice to his father, a blacksmith, Aiden spends his days forging weapons and armor for warriors who, he feels, lead much more interesting lives. One fateful day, a traveling storyteller named Leona arrives in the city. As the sun begins to set, she weaves a tale of the Great Eatlon to a captivated audience in the town square. She explains that the mythical bird was created centuries ago by a legendary sorcerer as a guardian against the Dark Nexus, a powerful and malevolent force that threatened to destroy all life in Antharas. Act II: Gradually, news reaches the city about strange occurrences outside Arandor's walls - colossal, twisted roots emerging from the ground, unexplained disappearances, and frightening shadows that seem to stir with malevolent intent. Sensing that the Dark Nexus has begun to awaken, Leona reveals to Aiden that she is an adept - a warrior who swore an oath to protect Antharas from the Dark Nexus. A legendary Holy Order of Adept Warriors exists, tasked with safeguarding the secret of summoning the Great Eatlon, which has been passed down through generations. With catastrophe looming and time running out, Leona and Aiden venture forth to seek the Holy Order, find the Great Eatlon, and unite a divided world against the impending threat of the Dark Nexus. During their journey, they encounter Mara, a mysterious wanderer with unique abilities and knowledge of Antharas' ancient history. With her guidance, the trio delves into long-lost ruins, encounters mythical creatures, and begins to uncover the intricate tapestry of events that led to the creation of the Great Eatlon. Through each step, they grow closer as a group; Aiden coming to understand that his seemingly mundane life has given him the skills and wisdom necessary to confront the challenges placed before him. Act III: With the Dark Nexus inching closer to full awakening, Aiden, Leona, and Mara manage to locate the Holy Order and learn the secrets of summoning the Great Eatlon. As they unite the people of Antharas to stand together against the looming threat, Aiden suddenly finds himself the reluctant leader of an army. In the climactic final battle, Aiden, empowered by the bond he shares with his friends, manages to summon the majestic Great Eatlon. With the combined might of the Holy Order, the people of Antharas, and the Great Eatlon, the trio secures a hard-fought victory against the Dark Nexus, banishing it to a dormant state once more. In the aftermath, Aiden realizes that the true power of the Great Eatlon lies not simply in the legendary beast itself, but in the unwavering unity and spirit of the people standing together against overwhelming darkness. The tale ends with Aiden, Leona, and Mara together, reflecting on their incredible journey as they watch the Great Eatlon disappear into the sunset, knowing that it will always be present to protect Antharas when the need arises."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the state that saw its only historical decline in population over a twenty-year period ending in 1950?, what is it ?

Summarize: B vitamins may help to reduce the effects of stress, which may include preventing headaches. Try taking a daily B-complex multivitamin to see if this helps to reduce the number and intensity of your barometric pressure headaches. Purchase a small barometer that you can install at home. Pay attention to whether the pressure drops or rises suddenly before you develop a headache. Then in the future, take preventative headache medication at the first sign that the pressure is changing quickly.  Check to see if your cell phone has a barometer app. This can alert you if the pressure begins to rise or drop. It's also a good idea to watch the weather predictions for pressure changes. Because dehydration is a common headache trigger and hydration is key in managing a headache, men should drink 15 cups (3,500 ml) of water a day while women should drink 11 cups (2,600 ml). Staying hydrated is especially important if you notice that increased humidity triggers your headaches. Magnesium can help to treat and prevent headaches because it promotes muscle relaxation. If you know the weather will be changing, include magnesium in your diet or take a supplement. Magnesium can block pain receptors in the brain and prevent blood vessels from narrowing in the brain. If you want to supplement, ask your doctor before you begin taking a daily 400 to 500 mg magnesium citrate supplement. To get magnesium from your diet, eat more:  Dark leafy greens Fish Soybeans Avocado Bananas If you've noticed that bright light, glare, or sensitivity to fluorescent lights triggers your headache or makes it worse, pay attention to weather changes. For example, if the weather has been overcast and a bright, sunny day is predicted, be prepared to take medication, stay indoors, or wear sunglasses.

It also happens to be the first stop in a wildly busy auto show season that includes layovers in Chicago, Geneva, Beijing, New York, Paris, Frankfurt, Los Angeles and, well, back in Detroit once January 2017 rolls around. This year, the sky is the limit when it comes to the variety of new cars and concept vehicles. Chevy is going electric with the production version of the Bolt EV, Chrysler is reinventing the minivan (again), while BMW and Porsche have turbocharged performance monsters at the ready. The 365-horsepower M2 Coupe represents everything we love about BMW. Lithe and lean, this rear-wheel-drive rocket is motivated by a twin-turbocharged, inline-6 cylinder engine coupled to your choice of 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE AND BE SURE TO FOLLOW ALL THE ACTION LIVE FROM DETROIT Scion is getting its first SUV. The C-HR has worn both Toyota and Scion badges during previous auto show appearances around the world. But Scion is getting the glory – and the potential sales boon – in the Motor City. Powered by a 4-cylinder and with a choice of front- or all-wheel-drive, the C-HR cashes in on the market surge for smaller, budget-conscious crossovers and SUVs. Minivans aren’t dead; they’ve just been ignored by the brand that invented them. Chrysler is finally revamping the Town & Country minivan, giving this family-friendly conveyance a wide range of gas and hybrid powertrains, along with an all-wheel-drive option for anyone living in snowy climates (like Detroit!). Here’s a name we didn’t think we’d see again. The first Ridgeline was a popular truck-meets-crossover, though the styling always struck us as being…well, weird. Look for the next Ridgeline to feature a boxier body, positioning it closer to outright pickups rather than cutesy crossovers. We’ve been saying it for years; Hyundai needs its own luxury division. That day has finally arrived, courtesy of the large and luxurious G90 sedan. This four-door cruiser is the first of many Genesis-branded cars and SUVs. Will buyers consider this South Korean upstart as a viable alternative to powerhouse brands from Germany, Japan, and the U.S.? Detroit will offer a big hint of things to come. Ford’s midsize sedan is due an update, even if the Aston Martin-like front end still packs plenty of curb-side appeal. Rivals like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry don’t stand still for long, so expect Ford to offer plenty of fuel-sipping engines, along with a plug-in hybrid variant. Most importantly, Ford’s oft-criticized infotainment system should get a massive overhaul to make it simpler to use. Big, bad, and very blue! The Lincoln Continental Concept wowed crowds throughout 2015 and, here in Detroit, we’re seeing the production version in all its glory. A twin-turbo V-6 engine and tons of road presence could mark the Continental as being the car that makes good on the Lincoln brand’s promised renaissance. Mercedes-Benz is leaving no stone unturned when it comes to loading the 2017 E-Class Sedan with power and tech. Autonomous drive functions, diesel engines, highly advanced dashboards and a twin-turbo V-8 are just a few of the highlights coming to this iconic German luxury sedan. The XC90 crossover has earned rave reviews, so now it’s up to the Swedish brand’s S90 sedan to keep the good vibes going. Elegant design, Volvo’s suite of City Safety features, and an optional 316-hp 4-cylinder engine that’s both turbo- and supercharged ensure that Volvo isn’t going away like dearly departed Saab. And thank goodness for that! Power, power, and MORE power. The all-wheel-drive Porsche 911 Turbo is mind-crushingly quick, yet it won’t try to kill you (much) if the weather doesn’t want to cooperate. A top speed in excess of 200 mph is made possible by the twin-turbo, flat-6 cylinder engine mounted at the rear of the car. The sprint from 0 to 60 mph takes only 2.8 seconds. Infiniti is revamping its hottest selling SUV in time for Detroit. The company’s new twin-turbo V-6 is being kept in the Q50 sedan, though the QX60 does benefit from crisper styling, including new head- and tail-lights, along with an upgraded cabin. Like Lincoln and Hyundai’s Genesis, Infiniti is a luxury brand on the move in the Motor City. Lexus is being coy, but we’re certain Toyota’s luxury division has something big planned. Possibly drawing inspiration from the LF-FC Concept shown at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show, this V-8-powered performance coupe should have around 500-hp and a 10-speed automatic transmission. Buick is a really big deal in China – it’s one of the country’s most popular car brands – so it was only a matter of time before a Chinese-built Buick headed stateside. Built in Shandong province, the Envision is a midsize SUV that blends inoffensive styling with Buick’s penchant for building whisper-quiet cabins. Mercedes has axed the SLK name, replacing it with the SLC you’ll see in Detroit. The base SLC300 comes with a 241-hp 4-cylinder, but we’re pining for the big daddy twin-turbo V-6 in the AMG-tuned SLC43. With 362-hp, this little Mercedes roadster only needs 4.6 seconds for the 0-60 mph sprint. Acura is giving a strong hint as to its future design direction with the Precision Concept. The teaser image looks to be a long sedan, with a low and swept-back greenhouse, along with aggressively flared rear fenders. A slinky four-door coupe, perhaps? Or could it be the rebirth of a Legend? (Please Acura, bring back actual names, especially that one!) Chevy is thinking small when it comes to going green. The electric-powered Bolt will be noticeably smaller and less expensive than the American brand’s current Volt hybrid. Driving range is expected to be around 200 miles a charge, while the Bolt’s price should fall around 30,000.","output":"The 2016 Detroit Auto Show showcased many exciting new cars and concepts. Some highlights included: Chevrolet's electric Bolt EV which is smaller and less expensive than Chevrolet's current Volt Hybrid, Chrysler's revamped Town & Country minivan with gas and hybrid powertrains, Scion's first SUV the C-HR, Hyundai's luxurious G90 sedan, the Lincoln Continental Concept, Mercedes-Benz's 2017 E-Class Sedan with advanced technology, Porsche's all-wheel-drive 911 Turbo, and Volvo's S90 sedan.

The answer is:","output":"To answer the question, let's consider the main factors that can affect the brightness of two objects: distance and intrinsic brightness. Step 1: Understand the context The question mentions two objects - a star and the sun. The context indicates that the distance from the observers plays an essential role in the perceived brightness of these objects. Step 2: Consider the distance factor The Sun is the star located at the center of our solar system, and its average distance from Earth is approximately 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. This distance makes the Sun the closest star to us. Meanwhile, other stars are located much farther away. The closest known star to us, Proxima Centauri, lies at a distance of around 4.24 light-years from Earth, which is roughly 268,770 times farther than the Sun. Step 3: Analyze the intrinsic brightness The intrinsic brightness of a star refers to its luminosity or the amount of energy it emits. The Sun, being a medium-sized and average-brightness star, might have higher or lower intrinsic brightness compared to other stars in the universe. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Given that distance is a significant factor in determining the perceived brightness of celestial objects, the dimmer of the two would be \\"a star.\\" This conclusion is based on the vast difference in distance between the Sun and other stars, which makes the Sun appear brighter in our sky even if some stars may have higher intrinsic brightness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I normally like the bratz dolls, but they do dress a bit on the slutty side and for a 4 year old that is just inappropriate. I am only encouraging the ones that do something active, like race cars, go skiing, and snowboarding. I think she will love this doll, it will be one of her first ones from the actually doll line. She has the baby bratz, but those dress very skimpy too. She actually took regular doll clothes that were appropriate and redressed her baby bratz without my prompting. I never thought I would buy bratz, but she really likes them and if they're not too slutty, I don't see the harm in it. Plus, buying the sporty ones can encourage her to think she's not just a pretty face and can do more with her life than sit and look pretty. A:","output":"The given review is likely to increase the chances of you buying the product, especially if you are concerned about the appropriateness of the toy for a young child. The reviewer acknowledges that they usually find the Bratz dolls to be dressed inappropriately, but this specific doll seems to be an exception. The fact that this doll is dressed more modestly and engages in active pursuits, such as racing cars or skiing, seems to be a positive aspect that the reviewer appreciates. Additionally, the review suggests that because the doll promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle, it's better suited for young children, especially those who may already be interested in the Bratz doll line but need a more appropriate option.

Among the topics we address in our course is the retention  of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim  position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays. An important lesson for the price of a Little League baseball glove. Question: This passage shows us that to run a business well it is necessary for managers to let their employees know    _    .

Translate to English","output":"The leader of the CHP (Republican People's Party), Deniz Baykal, has claimed that the European Union (EU) has treated Turkey differently than it has treated other candidate countries in the past. He stated the following: \\"We had previously drawn attention to the fact that no other candidate country has ever been offered open-ended negotiations.\\" In this statement, Baykal highlights the differential treatment that Turkey has allegedly received from the European Union in comparison to other countries that have applied for membership in the past. He emphasizes that Turkey has been subjected to a unique process of open-ended negotiations, which means that there were no definitive deadlines or clear expectations regarding the possible outcome of the negotiations. This approach, according to Baykal, has not been applied to any other candidate country in the past, which suggests that Turkey has been treated unfairly. The concerns raised by the CHP leader have been shared by many within Turkey who believe that the EU has not treated Turkey as an equal contender for accession, and instead imposed stricter conditions and requirements on the country. Some of the reasons cited for this differential treatment stem from apprehensions about Turkey's predominantly Muslim population, its potential impact on European integration, and its geopolitical location between Europe and the Middle East. Critics have also mentioned the fact that the negotiations with Turkey have been proceeding at a rather slow pace, with both sides experiencing difficulties in reaching agreement on certain benchmarks and criteria. Despite commencing in 2005, the accession talks between Turkey and the EU have not reached a conclusion, and there have been several occasions when the process was stalled or suspended. Nonetheless, both Turkey and the EU have expressed interest in continuing the negotiations, with the ultimate goal of securing Turkey's accession membership. As a result, many within the country remain optimistic that the ongoing dialogue will eventually lead to fruitful outcomes, despite the historical disagreements and challenges that have characterized the process."},{"instruction":"Q: ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground.

It uses the Latin script with additional diacritic marks to denote specific sounds. The language is closely related to other Slavic languages such as Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. In the Czech language, word order is relatively flexible compared to English. While the usual word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), it can be changed to emphasize certain parts of the sentence without losing its overall meaning. Additionally, Czech is a highly inflected language, meaning that words change their form to reflect grammatical information such as tense, case, person, gender, and number. For those interested in learning the Czech language, some useful phrases to start with are: 1. Dobrý den (Good day) - a standard greeting during daytime. 2. Ahoj (Hello) - an informal greeting, similar to \\"hi\\" in English. 3. Jak se máš? (How are you?) - a common question to ask about someone's well-being. 4. Mluvíte anglicky? (Do you speak English?) - a helpful phrase when trying to communicate with locals. 5. Děkuji (Thank you) - an essential expression to show gratitude. 6. Promiňte (Excuse me) - a polite way to get someone's attention or apologize for a minor offense. 7. Kde je…? (Where is…?) - a useful phrase for asking directions. It is essential to note that, like many languages, Czech has formal and informal forms of address. When speaking to someone older, in a higher position, or whom you don't know well, it's essential to use the formal form to show respect."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Uther's lust for Cornwall's wife Igrayne (Katrine Boorman) soon ruins the truce, and Merlin agrees to help Uther to seduce Igrayne on the condition that he gives Merlin whatever results from his lust. Merlin transforms Uther into Cornwall's likeness with the Charm of Making. Cornwall's daughter Morgana senses her father's mortal injury during his assault on Uther's camp; and, while Igrayne is fooled by the disguise and Uther impregnates her, Morgana sees through it, watching Uther as Cornwall dies in battle.

The exact time of the liftoff varies from source to source and is mentioned as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.At peak acceleration Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate. The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik 2's nose cone was jettisoned successfully; however the \\"Block A\\" core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the thermal insulation tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to 40 °C (104 °F). After three hours of weightlessness, Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas, \\"It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.\\"Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2—including Laika's remains—disintegrated during re-entry on 14 April 1958.","output":"Dimitri Malashenkov submitted a paper explaining how Laika died in the city of Houston, Texas, during the World Space Congress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir.

In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all.

Read this: In the Byzantine Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, \\"The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.\\" This a cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian musika which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as khorovïye kontsertï (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, Grammatika musikiyskaya (1675), by Nikolai Diletsky. Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as Peter Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Arkhangelsky, and Mykola Leontovych are fine examples of this. khorovïye kontsertï were typically done similar to what pieces? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The khorovïye kontsertï, or choral concertos, were typically done similar to the Venetian-style pieces during the late 17th century. This was a period when Russian Orthodox Church music started to adopt elements from Western European music, particularly from the Italian tradition. The Venetian-style pieces often referred to the polychoral style that was prevalent in Venice at that time, popularized by composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Claudio Monteverdi. These compositions featured multiple choirs, usually spatially separated, singing in alternation or antiphonally in a kind of dialogue, and often with different vocal combinations, color, and texture. The late 17th-century Russian khorovïye kontsertï made a cappella adaptations of these Venetian-styled pieces, staying true to the Byzantine Rite's tradition of singing without instrumental accompaniment. This adaptation was in part due to the influence of Nikolai Diletsky, who wrote about this style in his treatise Grammatika musikiyskaya (1675). The unaccompanied choral music often featured rich harmonies and polyphonic textures, with a primary focus on the human voice and the beauty it could create within the Eastern Orthodox Church's liturgical context. Examples of the khorovïye kontsertï-style compositions can be found in the works of later composers such as Peter Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Arkhangelsky, and Mykola Leontovych. These composers blended the traditions of the Byzantine Rite with the creative potential of Western musical styles, thus giving rise to a rich choral tradition marked by its a cappella rendering and intricate vocal lines that managed to convey the beauty and spirituality within the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Church's liturgies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Surfactants dissolve in water and reduce the surface tension on your hair, which helps the product remove dirt from the area. That sounds good, but some surfactants, like sulfates, can also be damaging to your hair, as they strip it of its natural oils. When using the Curly Girl method, avoid products with these ingredients. Look for products that are labeled \\"sulfate-free\\" to help you choose the best option for your hair.  In addition, read the ingredient list to look for sulfates. Even if a product is labeled \\"sulfate-free,\\" it may still contain sulfate ingredients. That's because the manufacturer is typically referring to more damaging sulfates, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Go over the ingredient list carefully to find sulfate ingredients before deciding if a product is Curly Girl approved.  Common sulfates include alkylbenzene sulfonate, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate, ammonium or sodium xylenesulfonate, and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate. Look for words or endings like \\"sulfate,\\" \\"sulfoacetate,\\" \\"sulfonate,\\" and \\"sulfouccinate.\\" These products tend to build up on your hair over time because they coat your hair to give it shine. They keep moisture from getting into your hair, and to get them out, you need harsh products that contain sulfates. Therefore, it's best to avoid them. Read the ingredient list to find ones with endings like \\"-xane,\\" \\"-cone,\\" \\"-col,\\" and \\"-conol\\" so that you can avoid products that contain them.  Common ingredients that fall into this category include dimethiconol, cetyl dimethicone, dimethicone, cetearyl methicone, and stearyl dimethicone. Use the same rues when buying styling products. Sometimes, proteins can make your hair dry and brittle. You're more susceptible to this issue if your hair is coarse, so if you're having this problem, check the ingredient list for proteins. Look for things like soy proteins, wheat proteins, amino acids, collagen, and keratin. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses the importance of avoiding certain ingredients, particularly sulfates and other harsh surfactants, when following the Curly Girl method for hair care.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What four bands went on a worldwide tour together? ?  Opeth entered Fascination Street Studios in November 2007 to record their ninth studio album, with Åkerfeldt producing. By January 2008, Opeth had recorded 13 songs, including three cover songs. The finished album, Watershed, features seven tracks, with cover songs used as bonus tracks on different versions of the album. Watershed was released on June 3, 2008. Åkerfeldt described the songs on the album as \\"a bit more energetic\\". Opeth toured in support of Watershed, including headlining the UK Defenders of the Faith tour with Arch Enemy, an appearance at Wacken Open Air, and the Progressive Nation tour with headliner Dream Theater. Watershed was Opeth's highest-charting album to date, debuting at number 23 on the US Billboard 200, on the Australian ARIA album charts at number seven and at number one on Finland's official album chart. Opeth went on a worldwide tour in support of Watershed. From September to October, the band toured North America backed by High on Fire, Baroness, and Nachtmystium. They returned to tour Europe for the rest of the year with Cynic and The Ocean.In 2010, Opeth wrote and recorded the new track, \\"The Throat of Winter\\", which appeared on the digital EP soundtrack of the video game, God of War III. Åkerfeldt described the song as \\"odd\\" and \\"not very metal.\\" To celebrate their 20th anniversary, Opeth performed a six-show, worldwide tour called Evolution XX: An Opeth Anthology, from March 30 through April 9, 2010.

Answer:","output":"The Woman's Journal was around for a longer time period as compared to Missbehave magazine. To provide a detailed understanding, let's dive into the history and publication run of both magazines: 1. Woman's Journal: The Woman's Journal was an American women's rights periodical that was first published on January 8, 1870. The magazine was established by Lucy Stone and her husband, Henry Browne Blackwell, both prominent figures in the women's suffrage movement. The publication served as the official organ of the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) and primarily focused on women's rights, with a particular emphasis on women's suffrage. The Woman's Journal was initially a weekly newspaper and later transitioned to a monthly magazine format before merging with another publication, \\"The Woman Citizen,\\" in 1917. After this merger, it continued publication under the new title, \\"The Woman's Journal and Suffrage News\\", until 1931. So, the Woman's Journal, in various forms and titles, had a publication run of over 60 years. 2. Missbehave: Missbehave was a contemporary women's magazine that was launched in 2006 by former \\"Vice\\" magazine editor, Lesley Arfin. It targeted a younger, urban demographic and covered topics such as fashion, culture, music, and lifestyle. The magazine aimed to empower young women by presenting alternative role models and encouraging self-expression. However, Missbehave faced financial challenges and struggled to maintain its footing in an increasingly competitive market. As a result, the magazine ceased publication in 2009, only three years after its inception. In conclusion, the Woman's Journal enjoyed a much longer publication run compared to Missbehave. Starting from 1870 until its discontinuation in 1931, the Woman's Journal had a publication run of over 60 years, whereas Missbehave had a publication run of only three years (2006 to 2009). This demonstrates the substantial difference in longevity between these two magazines, making the Woman's Journal the clear winner in terms of the duration it was around."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Investigate and determine the answers to each question. Step 3: Compare the context and answers of both questions to determine if they are paraphrases. Step 1: Identify the scope and context of each question. The first question asks for the best budget smartphone by an 'Indian Company'. The context here is specifically about Indian Company smartphones that are budget-friendly. The second question asks for the best non-Chinese budget smartphone. This question's context is broader, as it encompasses all budget smartphones that are not made by a Chinese company. Step 2: Investigate and determine the answers to each question. A) \\"What is the best budget smartphone by an 'Indian Company'?\\" There are several Indian smartphone companies that offer budget options. Based on online reviews and specifications, the Micromax IN 1B could arguably be considered one of the best budget smartphones by an Indian Company. B) \\"What is the best non-Chinese budget smartphone?\\" This question has a broader context, as it is not limited to only Indian companies. Popular options for non-Chinese budget smartphones include brands like Samsung, Nokia, and Motorola. Among them, the Samsung Galaxy A12 could be considered a great budget option. Step 3: Compare the context and answers of both questions to determine if they are paraphrases. The context of both questions is different. While Question 1 is focused on Indian companies, Question 2 is focused on non-Chinese companies (which could include Indian companies but also other countries' companies). Furthermore, the answers to both questions are also different. Thus, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"House Republicans Elect John Boehner as Speaker\\" Article:","output":"Title: House Republicans Elect John Boehner as Speaker Introduction In a recent, momentous decision, House Republicans have elected John Boehner as their new Speaker. Boehner, an experienced politician and former House Majority Leader, has proven himself to be a capable leader worthy of taking on this role. This article will delve into the factors that contributed to this decision, as well as what this means for the Republican Party moving forward. Background Before being elected as Speaker, John Boehner had held various leadership positions within the Republican Party over the years. Serving as a congressman from Ohio since 1991, Boehner had risen through the ranks, earning respect and admiration from his colleagues. His tenure included a stint as the House Majority Leader from 2006 to 2007, and as Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011. Boehner's experience and dedication to his party were critical factors in his recent election as Speaker. Reasons for Boehner's Election One of the primary reasons for Boehner's election was his ability to bring people together. Boehner has a strong track record of bridging gaps between the diverse factions within the Republican Party, including Tea Party members and moderate conservatives. Additionally, Boehner's skills in crafting and negotiating legislation were highly valued by his colleagues. Known for his pragmatic approach and focus on results, Boehner has been able to work effectively with legislators from both parties, which has resulted in the passage of several crucial bills despite the often-divisive nature of Congress. Implications for the Republican Party With Boehner now serving as House Speaker, the Republican Party is expected to strengthen its position in Congress. Boehner's leadership style, which emphasizes unity and collaboration, is likely to help develop a more cohesive party platform going forward. Moreover, Boehner's election could signal a shift in the party's strategy regarding its legislative agenda. As a seasoned negotiator, Boehner may be more inclined to forge compromises with Democrats in order to pass significant legislation, rather than adopting a purely obstructionist stance. However, Boehner will still face challenges from within his own party. Some members of the Tea Party faction may not fully support his approach to governance, which may result in internal disputes and potential difficulties in maintaining party unity. Conclusion In conclusion, John Boehner's election as House Speaker marks an important milestone for the Republican Party. His experience, ability to unify different factions, and pragmatic approach to legislation make him an ideal choice for this critical leadership role. As Boehner sets out to lead the Republican-controlled House, it will be intriguing to observe the impacts his leadership will have on both the Republican Party and the American political landscape as a whole."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE/BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children who have been detained apart from their parents. \\"We have a plan to do that,\\" the secretary told reporters at an event in Washington Thursday morning. Shortly before she spoke, a VOA reporter at an immigration court hearing in Brownsville, Texas, said prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges against 17 migrants. The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units. David Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \\"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\\" he told VOA. The administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \\"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts – that should be the end of the policy,\\" Bier added. The moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties. Nielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act. \\"I want to be very clear on this. Congress has the authority and responsibility to make the law of the land and to fix the immigration system,\\" the secretary said. \\"We have done everything we can do in the executive branch.\\" The outcome of the votes is uncertain.

Some supporters felt good about the decision, as they believed that keeping families together was a more humane approach. Others may have felt indifferent or even bad, thinking that the administration was stepping back from its initial stance on tough immigration enforcement. The response among Trump supporters was not uniform, and it is important to note that individual opinions may differ. It is not possible to definitively categorize the collective response of Trump supporters as bad, indifferent, or good, as there was a range of reactions with differing degrees of support for the policy change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

News article: 6 Creative iPad Uses For Small Business Retail This post originally appeared on the American Express OPEN Forum, where Mashable regularly contributes articles about leveraging social media and technology in small business. We all know iPads make great presentation devices and are excellent for business travel and chock-full of useful apps. Now, let’s focus on retail businesses — shops, salons and restaurants that use iPads to better service customers. Read on for some creative implementations of the iPad. If you start using an iPad at your business, just be sure to sanitize it frequently — fingers can carry a lot of germs. “The iPad is awesome,” says Flannery Foster, co-owner of Brooklyn’s goodyoga studio. The studio is also a bed and breakfast and serves as home to Flannery and her partner, “so we want it to seem less like a business and more like a community center or a home.” First order of business? Ditching the front counter and bar code scanner you see at a lot of yoga studios and gyms. “When people walk in the door, we hand them the iPad, and they sit on the couch — it’s a lot more casual, and we can bring them tea or water,” Foster says. Instead of standing awkwardly at the counter and filling out waivers and liability forms on a clipboard, the iPad makes people feel comfortable and also makes data entry a breeze for goodyoga. The studio uses a Google form, so the staff doesn’t have to worry about decoding a patron’s chicken scratch and the team saves times since the client info goes into the database automatically. “People have fun with it, and we have a lot of people who’ve never used an iPad before,” says Foster. “Sometimes they’re apprehensive, but most people have a lot of fun using it, and they love being able to sign with their finger when they pay with Square.” Lesson: Impress new customers and get them in your system quickly (for e-mail blasts, etc.) with a sleek iPad setup. TriBeCa nail salon Tenoverten offers iPads at every nail station. Co-owner Nadine Ferber says customers mostly use the iPads for web browsing, so they don’t have to offer any fancy apps. And yes, they still offer the typical glossy magazines for those customers who’ve been staring at a screen all day at work and want something more low-tech. “Customers love the iPads — some people have never used one before and are just thrilled to be able to without making a commitment to buying one,” says Ferber. She says more than half of the people who come in for manicures or pedicures use the iPad during their service, either to look something or check an email. “It’s a great tool for them to multitask while taking a little time out of the day for themselves,” she says. “And it’s one of the most differentiating things about our business as we are the only nail salon in the world that has an iPad at every manicure station.” Lesson: An iPad is a great investment as a differentiator that could keep customers coming back. Butter Lane in New York’s East Village was an early adopter of the iPad craze, affixing one to the wall to encourage people to “like” and follow the shop on Facebook and Twitter. Now the cupcakery has taken to rewarding customers who interact with the iPad, offering a free frosting shot to those who do. Frosting shots sell for 1, so it’s a small price to pay, and co-owner Maria Baugh says the shop gets a lot of engagement with the device, and “it’s definitely increased our number of ‘likes’ and follows — we give away a lot of icing shots!” Baugh says the device also helps them get customers in other ways. “We find that people use it to get more information about our [baking] classes and sometimes register for them,” she says. However, be warned that if you have an iPad, some customers might use it to check their own social media profiles, and you should also make an effort to lock it down. “The first one we put up just after iPads came out was stolen within the first month! We now have heavy duty industrial brackets holding it in place — it would take serious power tools to get this one off the wall,” says Baugh. Lesson: Use an iPad on-site to increase your Facebook and Twitter followings — you can offer a small reward as a thank you. “The iPads allow guests to control the flow and timing of their experience,” says Paul Motenko, co-founder of Stacked. “Guests can order a drink and appetizer and then entrees and desserts, when they are ready — or their whole meal at once to move things along faster.” Stacked also offers customers the option to pay directly via the iPad, so patrons don’t have to wait for the server to bring the bill, and one’s credit card information is encrypted at the table, so the system is secure. Of course, sometimes talking to a person is easier than dealing with a machine, so there are concierges on the floor to help guests when they need it. And all guests are given paper menus so that everyone can read through the menu at their own pace. When they are ready, they order from the custom-developed iPad app and tap “send” and then the order is routed directly to the kitchen. Motenko says customers love using the iPad. Since Stacked offers burgers, pizzas, salads and sausages with myriad available toppings, guests build their meal from the plate up. “The technology just makes it easier to customize what you want, how you want it and how quickly you want it,” he says. Since the iPad is intuitive, Motenko says guests of all ages have found the app to be easy to use and empowering to choose your own ingredients. Lesson: The iPad is a great, non-invasive tool that’s easy to use. You can save money on staff and not have to worry about pacing a meal, since the guests order at their own convenience. Healthy fast-food concept 4food opened last year in New York City, chock full of digital integrations, like a 15′ Twitter feed on one of the walls. The restaurant has six iPads available for customers to order from and browse the web. During peak hours, 4food “hawkers” roam the restaurant with iPads to take orders from customers so they don’t have to wait in line. The iPad integration is working well for the concept, and 4food brand strategist Ashley Tyson says the restaurant hopes to develop an iPad app soon so that customers can order easily and access information about the food and offerings. Lesson: Integrating digital tools into your business can help it run more efficiently, which could help your bottom line. ‘We take all of our orders with an iPod, and the staff runs credit cards with iPads,” says Jordan Langer of 620 Jones, a San Francisco bar. His team was also “very heavily entwined in developing the app” that drives the POS system. “It was a project that POSlab started doing, and then we jumped on board as their first main client. We started going after it with them because we know how a real POS should work,” says Langer. Jones servers go to tables with an iPod to take orders, and then the iPad drives the merchant processing. The iPads are always in the hands of staff and never handed to patrons. “People love it … they absolutely love it,” Langer says. “Inventory’s a lot easier to manage, the development is a lot easier, the interaction with the customers is a lot easier.” Lesson: An iPad can help you organize and stay on top of inventory, in addition to serving as an excellent POS system.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Long ago, Bluebird's feathers were the colour of dust. She did not like her ugly colour. She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home. It was as blue as the sky after a storm. Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, \\"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended  to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \\"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced  that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped  and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur. He rolled and rolled until he hit into Bluebird's tree heavily. No matter how much he tried, foolish Coyote could not shake the dust from his fur. And so the fur of all coyotes had the dull colour of dust to this very day. Question: Where did Coyote go after his fur turned blue? Options: A: To the lake. B: To the tree. C: To the cave. D: To the hill. The answer is:","output":"D: To the hill."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue the following story. Tim went to ride his motorbike down the coast this morning and checked the tire pressure which was low enough to not ride the","output":"bike safely. Realizing this, Tim decided to tackle the issue before he even attempted to set off for the journey. Having learned his lessons from past experiences, he knew very well the potential risks of motorbiking with low tire pressure.  First, he went to his garage to look for his trusty bike pump. It was a bit old and rusty, a relic from his early biking days but surprisingly efficient. Hidden behind a stack of boxed memorabilia and other infrequently used tools, it was like finding a treasure each time. Having dusted off the old pump, Tim approached his bike for a closer inspection of the tires. With an experienced eye, he could see that the rubber on his tires was worn out but still had a few more miles before needing a replacement. Sighing with relief, he knelt down beside his motorcycle and fixed the nozzle of the pump onto the valve of the bike tire.  As he began to pump, he could feel his arm muscles work with the rhythm of each pump. The morning sun had started shining brightly illuminating his garage in a golden hue, making the ambiance full of warmth and vivacity. The sound of metal clanging reminded him of the many mornings he had spent tuning up his motorcycle, a beloved hobby that gave him a sense of profundity and satisfaction. After a few minutes of vigorous pumping, the tire began to regain its solid, firm feel. Satisfied with the pressure, Tim removed the pump nozzle from the tire valve. He had a special gauge for checking the tire pressure which he had bought just recently. Fetching it from a drawer filled with an array of bicycle repair tools, he checked the tire pressure. The reading came back as normal, free from any deficiency that could potentially compromise his safety.  Casting a final appreciative glance at the bike that had seen him through many adventures, Tim took a few steps back. The bike stood there in all its glory, the newly pumped up tire adding to its proud stance. It was a thing of beauty, a source of joy, and a means of escape all combined into a well-greased, well-oiled machine. Satisfied, Tim wiped his sweaty forehead with the back of his hand and gave a small triumphant smile. Today was the day he would ride down the coast, feel the fresh ocean breeze against his face, and let his cares be drowned out by the purring of his motorbike's engine. He had a quick shower, ate a hearty breakfast, and picked a pair of sunglasses off the stand. As he put on his leather jacket and gloves, a sense of adventure welled up within him. Finally, strapping on his helmet and swinging his leg over his bike, he revved it up, the engine roaring to life. With a final wave to his quiet suburban home, Tim kicked up the stand and pushed down on the accelerator, his motorbike leaping forward, eager to be on the open road. With his tire issue resolved and the prospect of a thrilling ride ahead, he felt an overwhelming sense of anticipation.  Today was going to be another memorable chapter in his book of biking adventures. And as he rode down the lane, the wind carrying him forward, he knew that there was no other place he'd rather be than on his motorbike, exploring the unknown coast down the winding lanes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn? from the following article ?  John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest.  A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas. Answer:","output":"The full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn is John Michael Wright. The biographer who accepted this epithet is referred to as Verne in the article. Wright was a renowned portrait painter, and his origin is uncertain – he might have been born in London or Scotland.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The YouGov survey, commissioned by Stonewall Scotland, also revealed that a third of teachers hear homophobic language from other staff. The poll suggests the problem is rife, but only 16% of teachers have had specific training to deal with it. Some staff also said they were not allowed, or were not sure if they were allowed, to teach about LGBT issues. The Teachers' Report 2014 showed that 89% of primary school staff and 83% of secondary school staff have not received any specific training on tackling homophobic bullying. It also revealed that the majority of teachers in both secondary and primary education believe school staff have a duty to prevent and respond to homophobic bullying. The vast majority of primary school teachers - 92% - said different types of families, including those with same-sex parents, should be addressed in the classroom. Introduced by the Conservative government in 1988, Section 28 prohibited schools and councils from using lessons or publications to \\"promote\\" homosexuality. The law was scrapped in Scotland in 2000, but the YouGov poll revealed that 75% of primary and 44% of secondary school staff say they either were not allowed to, or were not sure if they were allowed to teach about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues in their school. Drama teacher John Naples Campbell, who has been teaching for more than 10 years, told the BBC: \\"There are still a lot of teachers within Scotland who believe that Section 28 is still there, or who were actually trained under Section 28 and haven't been given the training by the Scottish government to actually deal with (the issues) now.\\" \\"I think staff need to be more openâ€¦ we need to be much more confident about being open within our classrooms about issues that affect young people in the world today.\\" Stonewall Scotland director Colin Macfarlane said it was \\"troubling\\" that so many teachers said they had never received specific training on how to tackle homophobic bullying. He added: \\"That's why this year Stonewall Scotland launched a Train the Trainer programme which means we can work directly with teachers across Scotland. \\"However, the responsibility cannot be ours alone. The Scottish government, local authorities, schools and other agencies must now make it a priority that every single teacher is trained to tackle all types of bullying and abuse in our schools.\\" A Scottish government spokesman said: \\"Every secondary school in Scotland has been sent guidance on dealing with homophobia and homophobic bullying, as well as the filmed adaptation of Stonewall's highly successful play for schools. \\"Our national approach to anti-bullying sets out a common vision and aims to make sure that work across all agencies and communities is jointly focused on tackling bullying. We expect that all schools develop and implement an anti-bullying policy, which should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. \\"To support this we have established and wholly fund respectme, a national anti-bullying service, to build confidence and capacity to tackle all bullying, including prejudice-based bullying, effectively.\\" The Teachers' Report 2014 presents the findings from 260 respondents in Scotland. A total of 122 primary staff and 138 secondary staff were surveyed.

Write a title for this article: A seventh woman has stepped forward publicly with allegations that the comedian and actor Bill Cosby sexually assaulted her decades ago. In an interview on WPTV in West Palm Beach, Fla., the woman, Therese Serignese, 57, a registered nurse, accused Mr. Cosby of drugging and having sex with her after one of his shows at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1976 when she was 19. Although Mr. Cosby’s lawyers have routinely characterized such allegations as unfounded, the drumbeat of similar accusations over the last few weeks has led Mr. Cosby to withdraw from television interviews and has cost him several business opportunities as companies have canceled projects. Mr. Cosby has been all but silent on the matter. On Wednesday, The Associated Press released an interview it conducted with him on Nov. 6 in which he would not answer questions on camera about the allegations. The interview was intended to promote an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African Art, which features some works from Mr. Cosby’s collection, but when asked about the furor, he declined to comment. After the interview, while still being filmed, Mr. Cosby asked that none of the video of his refusal to comment be shown. “I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,” he said. In her interview with the local TV station in Florida, Ms. Serignese said that after meeting Mr. Cosby in the hotel gift shop, he invited her to watch the show, and she was given a front-row seat. She said that while she was alone with Mr. Cosby at an after-party, he offered her three large pills and said she should take them. She said she felt that she could not object. She was then sexually assaulted, she said. After that, she said, she stayed at a room in his penthouse suite for several weeks, but he made her leave when she told him she might be pregnant, which turned out to be a false alarm. They kept in touch, she said, and, later, when she got into financial difficulty, Mr. Cosby sent her money. Mr. Cosby’s lawyer Martin D. Singer did not reply to a request for comment. Mr. Cosby’s other lawyers have characterized the accusations that he drugged, raped or molested women decades ago as “decade-old, discredited allegations.” Ms. Serignese also gave her account to People magazine and to The Huffington Post. She said she had not spoken out publicly years ago because at that time she was young and believed that, given the culture of the era, few would have listened. “I did not want to be shamed, humiliated,” she said. But now, she said, she wants an apology. She said she came forward anonymously in 2005 and was one of 13 “Jane Doe” witnesses who had said they were prepared to present similar accounts as part of a lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand, a woman who had met Mr. Cosby when she was a staff member with the basketball program at Temple University, Mr. Cosby’s alma mater. She said she had been drugged and molested by Mr. Cosby. Ms. Constand’s suit was settled in 2006, but the terms were not released. By late Thursday, two additional women had come forward with stories about Mr. Cosby’s inappropriate sexual advances toward them, each occurring decades ago. Mr. Singer issued a statement in response. “We’ve reached a point of absurdity,” he said. “The stories are getting more ridiculous.” On Thursday, Temple University in Philadelphia said that Mr. Cosby would remain a trustee, a position he has held since 1982, according to The A. P. As the allegations have swirled around Mr. Cosby in recent weeks, NBC, Netflix and a cable network have canceled projects with him. But he has not let up on his “Cosby 77” stand-up tour. He was slated to go on stage Thursday evening at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas. On Friday, he is scheduled to appear in Melbourne, Fla., at a sold-out show at the Maxwell C. King Center for Performing Arts. The center said in a statement that while it was aware of the claims, “we are only in a position to judge him based on his career as an entertainer and humanitarian.” But on Thursday, the Desert Diamond Casino in Tucson canceled Mr. Cosby’s Feb. 15 show. The casino, in a statement, did not give a reason but said it regretted “any inconvenience to our guests.” A version of this article appears in print on November 21, 2014, on page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: 7th Accuser Joins Claims of Assault by Cosby.

The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

While on a television program several years ago, I recounted a story about moving with my family into a new home in the suburbs of Washington. As a black family, we were welcomed to the neighborhood with a shocking sight. My mother and I looked out the kitchen window the morning after we moved in to notice that someone had driven across our new lawn, skidding over mom's cute dogwood tree, and placed a cross there to intimidate us. Not being wanted in this neighborhood based on the color of our skin made a fearful and lasting impression on me as a 9-year old. About a week after the show a letter came to my office. Penned by a man who identified himself as a \\"White Fundamentalist Supremacist Christian,\\" the letter was a fiery missal responding to my television appearance and underscoring his disdain for black people and his glee over the fact that I had a \\"burning cross\\" (I never said it was burning) in my front yard. I have this letter posted on the back of my office door with a note I wrote across it with a black sharpie: \\"This is why God has called us to be gracists and ambassadors of reconciliation!\\" As whites become minorities in America, traditional minority groups like mine will be called upon to graciously build bridges to help whites adjust to their new minority status without malice or vengeance. Diversity is an ever-evolving, rotating movement of new people and new perspectives in America. While the term may have been largely about blacks at one time, and more recently, Latinos, we find Koreans, Chinese and Filipinos filling up the melting pot. In some areas of the country, as in Michigan, it's the burgeoning Muslim population, or in Minnesota and Ohio, the growing populations of Somalis. Diversity is here to stay. Welcome to the realization of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. Yet, when King gave his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, I wonder if he ever envisioned a day when whites in America would actually be the minority. Judging people by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin is altogether as important as it is for blacks. This will become increasingly the case in the decades to come. Integrating whites into the mosaic of American society is an important ideal to embrace, because integration has always been construed as mixing other minorities into a white-dominated world. Whites will become a minority within three decades, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If this happens as predicted, within little more than one generation, whites will be the largest minority group in America. In the United States we are in for a new age of diversity that all Americans should be aware of with eyes wide open. For the first time in U.S. history, the majority rule of whites will be threatened, which means the concept of rugged individualism that worked so well for whites in America in centuries past may be threatened. The rules of personal responsibility and relational networking (some call it the \\"good old boy\\" network) as an avenue for success will no longer be sufficient in a multicultural and global society. I predict the new minority whites will break into at least two groups: diverse whites, those who are culturally aware and multiculturally proficient, and reverse whites, those who will fight doggedly to hold on to whatever superior status they can. Other minorities, especially blacks, have a choice to be what I call \\"gracists,\\" people who extend favor, kindness, forgiveness and grace to others regardless of, and sometimes because of, color, class or culture. Whites will have the choice of retreating into fear and loathing or embracing their new status with understanding and grace. The integration of whites is not their sole responsibility. Gracism is the powerful assertion that each group should extend grace toward other groups, including minorities extending it to their former oppressor and whites extending it to others rather than protectionism out of fear. The more perfect union will become a reality if that union of gracists will realize that the dream of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. extends to all multicultural configurations and presupposes the coming together of all people as equally human. The factional system of dysfunctional diversity, where power structures are reserved for a majority race to dominate others, is being dismantled one generation at a time. The mosaic of more Americans sharing power beyond one or two dominating racial groups will demand new partnerships based on sociological-political ideas that will drive robust debates, giving birth to innovation and collaboration. The ugly beast of race baiting and power hoarding will not easily die, at least not without a vitriolic fight. In the not-so-distant future, we can expect that diverse whites and reverse whites will be at odds. Gracists must be present to step into the divide and integrate them both. Reverse whites who want to go back to the way things were will still write letters applauding fear mongering. White interest groups may subversively advocate for sustaining institutional structures that perpetuate inequality. The fear of loss of racial dominance may give birth to a growing number of whites feeling cultural disequilibrium. But diversity is here to stay. Immigration is our history. Unity has a chance at being our destiny. If we enter into this brave new world with a spirit of grace, our success as a multicultural, multi-ethnic nation will be a dream realized. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Anderson. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article, written by a black individual recounting their own experiences with racial intimidation in childhood, explores the topic of diversity and the predicted shift of Whites becoming minorities in America. The author notes the increasing diversity of America, encompassing not only Blacks and Latinos but also other ethnic groups from Asia and Africa. He suggests that while America moves toward Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision of people being evaluated on their character rather than their skin color, it's crucial to consider this in light of Whites also becoming a minority. Based on U.S. Census Bureau predictions, Whites are set to become a minority within three decades. This shift challenges the traditional concept of individualism under which Whites largely prospered, in favor of a more multicultural and globally oriented society. The author categorizes the future white minority into two - 'diverse whites' who are more culturally aware and 'reverse whites' who will strive to maintain their previously superior status.  The author introduces the concept of 'gracism', which involves people extending favor, forgiveness, and grace to others irrespective of color, class, or culture. He argues that gracism is not only the responsibility of the whites but of all racial groups, each extending grace towards the other, including to their previous oppressors.  The author predicts the ongoing dismantling of power structures that allow a single race to dominate others, leading to a more democratic distribution of power across racial lines. This shift could promote new partnerships, foster innovation, and fuel robust debates. However, he also warns of potential resistance and conflict, particularly among 'reverse whites' reluctant to accept the change. The author ends on a hopeful note, emphasizing that with grace and tolerance, America can successfully transition into a truly multicultural, multi-ethnic nation. He argues that the increasing racial and cultural diversity is America's reality and potentially its destiny. So it's critical to embrace it with grace and understanding. The continued integration of formerly dominant racial groups is seen as a key part of achieving this vision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They were fascinated by the subject and learned a lot. Team A studied Earth, team B studied planet Venus.  Which team didn't learn about sulfur dioxide clouds?  Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! The answer is:","output":"Team A didn't learn about sulfur dioxide clouds. To elaborate, Team A focused their studies on Earth's atmosphere. As the hint in the question suggests, clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Earth's atmosphere primarily consists of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and trace amounts of other gases like argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. The clouds in Earth's atmosphere mostly contain water vapor and occur in various forms, such as cirrus, stratus, and cumulus. On the other hand, Team B studied the atmosphere of Venus. Venus has a thick and highly toxic atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. The clouds on Venus are primarily made of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid, which makes them very different from the clouds we find on Earth. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venus is 90 times greater than on Earth. This, coupled with a strong greenhouse effect, makes Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures reaching up to 465°C (860°F).

Senator Charles Carroll (William \\"Bill\\" Boyce), an independent senator, is holding a luncheon atop the Seattle Space Needle. Joe Frady (Warren Beatty), an alcoholic journalist, tries to gain entry to the luncheon, but is turned away. At the restaurant atop the Space Needle, Senator Carroll is holding a press conference when he is suddenly shot to death by an unseen assassin. Everyone looks around and sees a waiter holding a gun, and he is jumped by security guards. However, a second waiter (Bill McKinney), who also has a gun (and the real or second shooter) leaves unnoticed. The first waiter replies that he didn't do it, and he is chased over the roof of the building by guards, where he accidentally slips and falls off the roof to his death. The real assassin chuckles as he leaves the scene and reports to an unseen contact that the job is finished. Four months later, a commission holds a special public gathering and they conclude that the waiter, named Thomas Richard Lindern (Chuck Waters), acted alone and that there is no greater conspiracy to the assassination of Senator Carroll.Three years later. Joe Frady, writing for a Portland, Oregon newspaper, sets himself up to get arrested to get a story on a major drug bust. Frady is bailed out of jail by his boss and editor Bill Rintels (Hume Cronyn) who always complains that Frady is trying to create news rather than reporting it. Shortly thereafter, Frady is visited by Lee Carter (Paula Prentiss), a Seattle newscaster and his former girlfriend, who tells them that she fears for her life. Lee tells Frady that someone is trying to kill her and that six other reporters at the luncheon have all died mysteriously during the past two years. Frady shrugs her off by telling her that she's just being paranoid. But a few days later, Lee is found dead in her apartment. Frady investigates and the coroner tells him that she apparently killed herself with an overdose of sleeping pills, but Frady knows different.Frady tells Rintels that there is a story...

If \\"A photographer adjusting the settings on his camera.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A photographer adjusts the lights.\\"?","output":"While it is possible that a photographer adjusting the settings on his camera may also adjust the lights, it does not logically follow as a necessity. There are various aspects to consider when understanding the relationship between adjusting camera settings and adjusting lights within the context of photography. Here, we will discuss these aspects in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of why these two actions don't necessarily imply one another. Firstly, let us consider the numerous settings on a camera that can be adjusted. These include: 1. Aperture: This controls the amount of light that enters the camera lens during exposure. A larger aperture allows more light, while a smaller aperture allows less light. 2. Shutter Speed: This determines the duration that the camera sensor is exposed to light. Faster shutter speeds allow less light, and slower shutter speeds allow more light. 3. ISO: This controls the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light. Higher ISO values increase sensitivity, allowing for correct exposure at lower light levels, while lower ISO values decrease sensitivity. 4. White Balance: This setting adjusts the colors in an image to ensure accurate color representation based on the temperature of the light source. 5. Focus: This setting controls the sharpness of the subject within an image. None of these adjustments explicitly require a photographer to adjust the lights, as they can all be made on the camera itself. However, adjusting the camera settings may sometimes lead a photographer to consider adjusting the lighting as well if they feel it could help achieve their desired outcome. This is more a matter of preference and need, rather than a logical conclusion. Secondly, let us consider the various lighting conditions a photographer may encounter and the reasons for (or against) adjusting external lights: 1. Natural Light: When working with natural light, a photographer may opt to utilize the available sunlight and make adjustments on the camera itself instead of adding supplementary light sources. 2. Studio or Artificial Light: In a studio setting or when using artificial light, a photographer may need to manipulate external lights to achieve the desired effect. However, adjusting the camera settings may still be done independently of adjusting the lights. 3. Mixed Light: In situations where both natural and artificial light sources are present, a photographer may need to balance these light sources using both camera settings and external lighting adjustments to achieve the best possible result. It should be noted that adjusting lights in any context might require various techniques, such as modifying light intensity, changing the direction of the light, or utilizing light modifiers like diffusers, umbrellas, and softboxes. However, these actions don't necessarily correlate with adjusting camera settings. In conclusion, while it can be beneficial for a photographer to adjust and balance both camera settings and lighting to achieve optimal results in their photography, it doesn't logically follow that adjusting the camera settings inherently leads to adjusting the lights. The two actions have the potential to be done independently of one another, and will often depend on factors such as the photographer's preferences, needs, and the lighting conditions they are working with."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City.

English jeweller and naturalist William Bullock and his son travelled to Mexico soon after its independence, spending six months in 1823 collecting archeological artifacts and many bird and fish species new to science. The bird specimens were given to naturalist William John Swainson, their countryman, to formally describe, which he did in 1827. Among these was the red warbler, which was assigned to the genus Setophaga, as Setophaga rubra. Over the next half century, other authorities moved it to Cardellina, with the red-faced warbler, and to the widespread tropical warbler genus Basileuterus, as well as to the Old World warbler genus Sylvia and the Old World tit genus Parus. In 1873, English naturalists Philip Lutley Sclater and Osbert Salvin moved the species to the genus Ergaticus, where it remained for more than a century.The red warbler forms a superspecies with the pink-headed warbler of Chiapas and Guatemala. Despite their disjunct ranges and considerably different plumages, the two have sometimes been considered conspecific. Conversely, it has also been suggested that the red warbler should be split into a northern gray-eared species (C. melanauris) and a southern white-eared species (C. rubra). A comprehensive 2010 paper by Irby Lovette and colleagues analysing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the New World warblers found that the red and pink-headed warblers are each others' closest relative and that their common ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the red-faced warbler. The authors recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina, a suggestion which has been adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).There are three subspecies, which differ slightly in appearance: C. r. rubra, described by Swainson in 1827, has white ear patches and is found from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca.

My girlfriend and I always frequent Starbucks and this is one of the locations that she is a regular at.     Every day, if not twice a day, she comes here and will order a Venti Iced Caramel Macchiato, no ice (because she has sensitive teeth), skinny and mixed well.  What they do with no ice is that they add milk to fill it up.  For almost 4 months now, she's never had a problem with that.  But this last week, after getting her coffee she noticed that her usual coffee was no .75 more.  What??  When asking the girl behind the window to explain, she said that was for the few ounces of milk.    Last I checked, a gallon of milk was about 2.00.  So you're telling me for barely 3/4 of a cup, you are going to charge .75?  WOW.  She asked to speak to the manager, who you could tell loved being the manager of a Starbucks.. Oh the power.

She said \\"Ill take my damn coffee and never be back here again!\\"    Seriously, every other Starbucks we visit and its probably 4 or 5 total,  have never charged to add milk.

If \\"A person mixes together ingredients.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A person is eating the ingredients\\"?","output":"No, it does not logically follow that if \\"A person mixes together ingredients,\\" then \\"A person is eating the ingredients.\\" These are two separate actions that may or may not be related. Let us break down the two statements and understand the logic behind each of them. Statement 1: \\"A person mixes together ingredients.\\" This statement describes the action of a person combining different ingredients, typically during the process of preparing a dish or recipe. It implies that the individual is engaged in an activity such as cooking, baking, or making a beverage. Mixing ingredients is an essential step in creating various food items or concoctions. In this step, the person is not consuming the ingredients but rather combining them to achieve a desired result, such as a specific taste or texture. Statement 2: \\"A person is eating the ingredients.\\" This statement describes the action of a person consuming the ingredients, either individually or as a part of a prepared dish. Eating is an act of ingesting food or ingredients, typically to provide nutrition and sustenance. While it is possible that the person may sometimes taste ingredients during the preparation process to ensure the desired flavor is achieved, it does not necessarily mean that they are eating the ingredients as a whole or in significant quantities. When we analyze these two statements, we can see that they describe separate and distinct actions. In other words, just because a person is mixing ingredients, it does not automatically mean that they are eating the ingredients. Mixing ingredients is related to the preparation process, while eating refers to the consumption of food.  However, it is worth noting that the two actions could be related in some instances. For example, after a person mixes together ingredients to prepare a dish, they may decide to eat the resulting food after it is cooked or properly presented. In this case, mixing the ingredients is a precursor to eating them. Nevertheless, the act of mixing ingredients alone does not imply that a person is eating them simultaneously or will automatically consume them shortly after. In conclusion, mixing ingredients and eating them are two separate actions, and one does not necessarily imply the other. While it is possible that both actions may occur consecutively or in conjunction as a part of the food preparation and consumption process, they are ultimately independent of one another and should not be assumed to occur simultaneously or interchangeably."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If heat causes fewer grapes to grow, it will have a direct impact on the number of grapes available for washing. With a reduced number of grapes, there will be less grapes to wash, meaning the second stage in the process will be affected. The decrease in grape production due to heat will result in a lower volume of grapes to be cleaned, and therefore, the washing workload will lessen. The supposed perturbation influencing the second effect mentioned can be analyzed as follows: 1. Less raw material (grapes) due to heat: As fewer grapes are grown, the raw material for wine production will be significantly reduced. This will directly affect all the subsequent steps, including washing, as there will be fewer grapes available for processing. 2. Change in workload: With the reduction in grape volume, there will be less demand for washing and handling the grapes. This will affect the workload on the individuals or machinery involved in the washing process, potentially resulting in reduced efficiency or increased idle time. 3. Quality considerations: As the heat affects grape growth, this can also have an impact on the quality of grapes, which may lead to a higher percentage of grapes being discarded before washing due to inadequate quality. This, in turn, can exacerbate the reduction in the number of grapes to be washed. In conclusion, the effect of heat causing less grape growth directly influences the washing stage of the grape production process by reducing the volume of grapes to be washed, leading to a lesser workload and potentially affecting grape quality. Therefore, it can be said that the perturbation has a lessening effect on the second stage, washing, as it causes a decrease in the number of grapes available for processing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Verify the information To determine whether the provided statement (\\"In terms of theory, Arabic translation drew heavily on earlier Near Eastern traditions as well as more contemporary Greek and Persian traditions.\\") is a correct answer, research needs to be done on the time period when translation work into Arabic increased, as well as the possible factors or influences in that process. Step 3: Research Based on my research, Arabic translation began to increase during the Islamic Golden Age (8th-13th century). This period saw significant progress in various fields such as sciences, mathematics, and literature, thanks in part to the translation movement. Scholars translated numerous works from Greek, Persian, and Indian sources into Arabic, which played a critical role in preserving, integrating, and expanding upon their knowledge. Step 4: Evaluate the provided statement The given statement highlights the sources that influenced the Arabic translation. It is correct to say that Arabic translation drew from earlier traditions and other contemporary sources like Greek and Persian, but it doesn't give an explicit time frame for when translation began to increase. Step 5: Formulate an answer The statement has relevant information about the influences on Arabic translation, but it does not directly answer the question about when translation into Arabic began to increase. A more fitting answer would be: \\"The translation of material into Arabic began to increase during the Islamic Golden Age (8th-13th century) due to the vibrant intellectual environment and the influential role of translation in preserving and expanding various fields of knowledge.\\" So, the correct answer is not the one provided, but rather the aforementioned statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The word \\"strike\\" in both sentences refers to the same core meaning of hitting or making contact with something, usually to produce some effect. However, the context in which the word \\"strike\\" is used in each sentence helps to shape how the action is performed and the purpose of the action. In the first sentence, \\"Strike 'z' on the keyboard,\\" the word \\"strike\\" means to press, hit or make contact with the 'z' key on a keyboard. The purpose of this action is to input the character 'z' into a computer program or system. It implies that the person should apply force to the key in a firm manner to ensure that the desired character is entered. In the second sentence, \\"The pianist strikes a middle C,\\" the word \\"strike\\" refers to a similar action, where the pianist is hitting or making contact with the piano key (middle C) to produce a specific note or sound. In this context, striking the key is done to create music, and the forcefulness or technique with how the key is struck will influence the style and character of the sound produced. Although the specific context and purpose of the action might vary between the two sentences, the core meaning of the word \\"strike\\" remains consistent as an action of hitting or making contact to produce some effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this math problem Solve 1092 - 1078 = -2*c for c.","output":"To solve this problem, you first need to simplify the left side of the equation by subtracting 1078 from 1092. Let's do that: 1092 - 1078 = 14  So, now our equation on the left-hand side is simplified as: 14 = -2*c To solve the equation for c, you need to isolate c. To do this, divide both sides by -2 to cancel out the -2 multiplying c on the right side. It's important to remember that whenever you perform an operation (like division) on one side of an equation, you must also perform the same operation on the other side to keep the equation balanced. Do the math: 14 / -2 = -7 When dividing 14 by -2, we get -7.

Write highlights for this article: British Gas has launched an investigation into solar panels at dozens of schools and businesses after a series of mystery fires. Some 92 schools that signed up for free panels have been told their equipment will need improvements before it is considered safe to use. It comes after solar panel fires in three schools were confirmed by British Gas following a tip-off to The Mail on Sunday. A third roof blaze damaged two classrooms at Sutton Bonington Primary School in Nottinghamshire (above) Although an investigation after the first two was ruled 'inconclusive', it is believed the energy giant was forced to carry out improvements when a third roof blaze damaged two classrooms at Sutton Bonington Primary School in Nottinghamshire. More than 90 schools and 27 business fitted with the suspect equipment have been left without free solar energy since April. The news is likely to come as a blow to Energy Minister Greg Barker, who the same month unveiled plans to put solar panels on the roofs of 24,000 schools. British Gas has stressed that 160 other schools fitted with earlier versions of the panels are unaffected and that household ones are safe. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire County Council said the panels had been installed as part of British Gas's Generation Green project, which gives schools free equipment in return for a Government green subsidy payment. A British Gas spokesman would not reveal the cost of the shutdown, although sources say it could run 'well into six figures' once compensation – for the extra cost of mains electricity – is included. Gab Barbaro, managing director of British Gas Business Services, said: 'Safety is our number one priority. Following an incident in April, we decided to turn off solar panels at certain non-domestic sites as a precaution while we undertook a full investigation. British Gas has stressed that 160 other schools fitted with earlier versions of the panels are unaffected and that household ones are safe (File photo) No one was hurt and we have worked with independent experts to establish the cause. 'As a further precautionary step, we are upgrading part of the solar installations at these sites.' Professor Stuart Irvine, director of Glyndwr University's Centre for Solar Energy Research, said panel fires were unusual. He added: 'The cause here may lie in wiring or junction boxes, where power is converted for the grid, rather than the panels themselves. 'There's an argument that the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) needs to look at this. We must make sure there's adequate testing of components and sufficient protection for buyers.' A spokesman for the DECC said: 'As legal action is pending, it would not be appropriate to comment.' Highlights:","output":"1.

Question: This article: Since 1991, the anniversary of the massacre has been designated the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, intended as a call to action against discrimination against women.  A White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 1991 by a group of men in London, Ontario, in the wake of the massacre, for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing \\"the idea of men giving up their arms.\\" Commemorative demonstrations are held across the country each year on December 6 in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been built. The Place du 6-Décembre-1989 in the Côte-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre. Located at the corner of Decelles Avenue and Queen Mary Road, a short distance from the university, it includes the art installation Nef pour quatorze reines (Nave for Fourteen Queens) by Rose-Marie Goulet. It is the site of annual commemorations on December 6.A memorial erected in Vancouver sparked controversy because it was dedicated to \\"all women murdered by men\\", which critics say implies all men are potential murderers. As a result, women involved in the project ironically received death threats and the Vancouver Park Board subsequently banned any future memorials that might \\"antagonize\\" other groups.The event has also been commemorated through references in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called The Anorak was named as one of the best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette.  Colleen Murphy's  play \\"December Man\\" was first staged in Calgary in 2007  The movie  Polytechnique, directed by Denis Villeneuve was released in 2009, and sparked controversy over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person made a fire that burned less bright?  Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. The answer to this question is:","output":"Danny made a fire that burned less bright. This is because he used large logs that he fell a few months back, which have a smaller surface area and thus burn relatively slowly compared to small twigs, kindlings, and sawdust used by Bob.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you're treating a stain on a piece of fabric or clothing, stretch the fabric over a large bowl. Position the stain in the center and wrap a rubber band around the outside of the bowl to hold the fabric in place. Bring a kettle of water to a boil and slowly pour the hot water through the stain and into the bowl.  The hot water can loosen the stain and force it out of the fabric. If you're cleaning a fabric stain on a couch, you'll need to remove the cover or cushion to get to the stain. Get out a small bowl and pour in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of gentle dishwashing liquid. Stir in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of hydrogen peroxide until it's combined. Apply the solution to the stain and let it just soak in for 20 minutes. Once the stain looks like it's lifting, wash the material in the washing machine. Only use the brightening dish soap solution on light fabrics since it can lighten dark fabrics. Another way to lift stubborn stains is to coat the stain with white vinegar. Take a few spoonfuls of liquid laundry detergent and rub the soap in. This should loosen the stain. Wash the fabric in hot water to completely remove the stain. If you don't have very many materials to make a deep cleaning solution, just spray club soda mixed with equal parts of white vinegar over the stain. Use paper towels or an old towel to blot up the mixture. You can repeat spraying and blotting until you see the stain lifting.

As you drink, try to hold your breath for as long as you can. Additionally, you might plug up your ears. This technique works best if your water is ice cold rather than just chilled. Add water to a glass until it’s half full. Then, lean over your glass and drink from the side farthest away from you, which will simulate drinking upside down. As another option, you can lie upside down off of your bed or couch, then carefully drink the water.  Stop every few sips to see if your hiccups have gone away. Be careful that you don’t accidentally breathe in the water or pour it into your nose. Take a spoon and fill it with white or brown sugar. Then, hold the spoon in your mouth for 5-10 seconds. Finally, swallow the sugar and take a big sip of water. If this doesn't work straight away, it's not a good idea to ingest spoonful after spoonful of sugar. Instead, switch to a different technique. Place a lemon wedge into your mouth. Then, either bite into the wedge and drink the juice, or suck on the wedge to get the juice. If the taste is too much for you, it’s okay to add a little sugar to the lemon wedge to sweeten it. The taste of the lemon juice causes a similar reaction to someone scaring you. Vinegar may help combat your hiccups, but you may find its smell and taste to be unpleasant. Since pickle juice contains vinegar, you can drink it instead. Take a few sips of pickle juice or put a few drops of it onto your tongue. Then, repeat as necessary until your hiccups are gone. All pickle juice contains vinegar, no matter the type of pickle. Scoop out a small spoonful of peanut butter, then place it onto your tongue. Hold it in place for 5-10 seconds to let it dissolve some. Then, swallow the peanut butter without chewing. Other nut butters like almond butter or Nutella can be substituted for the peanut butter, if you prefer. Summary:","output":"1. Fill a glass with ice-cold water. 2.

Sentence 2: Scheck would have many more trials. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"In order to analyze the truth of the second sentence based on the first sentence, we must first understand the content and context of both sentences. It is important to note that the truth of the second sentence is not solely dependent on the content of the first sentence, but it can be related depending on the context.  Sentence 1: \\"But the Woodward case--his second Trial of the Decade--reflects Scheck's high-mindedness as much as his greed.\\" In this sentence, we get information about a specific case, the Woodward case, which is referred to as Scheck's second \\"Trial of the Decade.\\" This statement seems to suggest that Scheck has participated in two significant and high-profile trials during this decade. Moreover, the sentence describes Scheck's characteristics, mentioning both his high-mindedness and his greed. Sentence 2: \\"Scheck would have many more trials.\\" This sentence states a prediction or hypothesis that Scheck will be involved in many more trials in the future. It does not specify how many trials or over what period. Now, to address the question as to whether the second sentence is true if the first one is true: these sentences are related to each other in the sense that they both pertain to Scheck and his career in trials. However, the truth of the second sentence is not determined solely based on the first sentence. The first sentence confirms that Scheck has already participated in at least two well-known trials, but it does not provide any direct information regarding his future involvement in trials. The second sentence is a separate statement about Scheck's future and cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided in the first sentence alone. We would need further evidence or context to determine if Sentence 2 is indeed true. For instance, if we knew that Scheck is a successful and ambitious defense attorney who is consistently involved in high-profile cases, the likelihood of the second sentence being true would increase. However, the truth of the second sentence cannot be definitively concluded based on the content of the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I just bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time the other night. I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years now, ever since I got out of high school. I didn't grow up on this movie...perhaps my mother kept me away from it. It's definitely not for children. Not that it's bad in a graphic sense, but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads. Overall, the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978/1979. I thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense. But I am bothered that Bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the Return of the King parts. That would've made it the ultimate movie. I was bothered by it's abrupt end, and then when I heard Return of the King sucked, I was bothered even more. Too bad it wasn't one great animation film. It might have garnered a higher vote from me. I give it a 7. I can only hope Peter Jackson will do the books justice with the new live action LOTR. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review? Choose from:  + negative  + positive","output":"The sentiment of this review is generally positive.  In this review, the watcher begins by expressing their longstanding appreciation for J.R.R. Tolkien's work and how they have recently watched a movie adaptation of it. They praise the animation quality given the time it was created, noting it was \\"excellent.\\" They also commend the filmmakers for following the original story to a reasonable extent, describing the adaptation as \\"fairly good in a loose sense.\\" This shows that, overall, their impression of the movie is largely favorable. However, the review also contains elements of criticism and disappointment. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the film's ending and the omission of some parts of the original story, specifically related to \\"Return of the King.\\" They express disappointment that these missing parts weren't included, suggesting it would have made the movie more complete and likely would have earned it a higher personal rating from them. Despite these criticisms, the reviewer still rated the film a 7, showing that they found significant value and enjoyment in the movie despite its flaws. They end by expressing hope for future versions of LOTR by Peter Jackson, indicating that they remain a fan of the franchise. In conclusion, while the reviewer found fault with some aspects of the film, their overall sentiment leans toward the positive side, acknowledging the film's strengths and ultimately giving it a respectable rating.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government? from the following article ?  Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including \\"Meadowlands\\" by Strike Vilakezi and \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\"Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period\\". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\".

Answer the following question: Article: As one of Hollywood's all-time greatest actress, Audrey Hepburn is famous all over the world. When Hepburn died in 1993, the world mourned the loss of a great beauty, a great actress and a great humanitarian. Born in Belgium on 4th May 1929, Hepburn dreamed of becoming a successful ballet dancer. She had also been a model before she entered the film industry. In 1951, while acting in Monte Carlo Baby, Hepburn met the famous French writer Colette, who was attracted by Hepburn's beauty and charm. She insisted that Hepburn was the perfect girl to play the lead role in Gigi, a play based on her novel. That event marked the beginning of Hepburn's successful career. Shortly after, Hepburn was chosen to play the lead role of a young princess in the Hollywood film Roman Holiday. It was a big success and earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. She also won a Tony Award for the play Ondine.[:..] During her lifetime, Hepburn earned four more Oscar nominations. In 1989, she made her final appearance in her last film Always and played the role of an angel. Throughout her acting years, she acted in only one TV series, Gardens of the world with Audrey Hepburn. By showing us the beauty of nature, Hepburn wanted to remind us that we should protect the environment. Hepburn is remembered not just as a great actress, but also as a great humanitarian. She was honoured with a number of awards because of her efforts in her charity work. In 1992, the President of the United States presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1991, Hepburn discovered that she had cancer. In 1993, at the age of 63, she passed away peacefully in her sleep. Question: People remember Hepburn not only as a great actress but also as   _   . Yes or no, is the answer \\"a kind lady\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"a kind lady\\" can be considered appropriate, as Audrey Hepburn is remembered not only as a great actress but also as a great humanitarian for her charity work and efforts to protect the environment.

Now, let's analyze the information: Premise states that the choice of more awkward Dems requires dismissing talk of Lewinsky and then talking endlessly about why they're not talking about her. The hypothesis states that most awkward Dems enjoy talking a lot about why they don't talk about Lewinsky. With the given information, to draw a conclusion, we need to connect the premise to the hypothesis.

If Enclosed by the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan, this azure freshwater lake is surrounded by orchards, banana plantations, kibbutzim, and Old and New Testament sites., can we conclude that \\"The lake between the Galilee and Golan mountains is not saltwater.\\"?","output":"Yes, one can conclude that the lake between the Galilee and Golan mountains, based on the given description, is not saltwater. Here is a more detailed explanation to elucidate on the matter. Firstly, the description explicitly designates the lake as a \\"freshwater\\" body. Freshwater, by definition, is water that contains minimal amounts of dissolved salts, particularly sodium chloride, or what we familiarly refer to as \\"salt\\". Therefore, these types of bodies of water, contrast sharply with \\"saltwater\\" which, as expected, possesses a high concentration of the dissolved salt. This category predominantly includes the oceans and seas. Secondly, the ecosystems and biodiversity surrounding and within freshwater and saltwater bodies tend to reflect their environmental conditions. According to the description, the lake hosts an array of human-made and natural features that are generally affiliated with freshwater. To illustrate, orchards and banana plantations necessitate access to fresh, untreated water to thrive. Saltwater, owing to its high salt content, is typically unsuitable for these types of crops since excess salt can impede the ability of plants to take in essential nutrients from the soil. Additionally, kibbutzim, which are collective communities typically found in Israel, often rely on local supplies of freshwater for various uses such as household, irrigation, and livestock. Also, the sites mentioned from the Old and New Testament, primarily in the region of Galilee, often reference areas associated with fresh bodies of water. Lastly, the described lake is virtually certain to refer to the Sea of Galilee, known also as Lake Tiberias or Kinneret in Israel. This lake is recognized for its biblical significance to Christianity and its rich historical context, besides being the primary water source of the country. It is one of the few freshwater lakes in the region and is indeed enclosed by the mountains of Galilee and Golan. In conclusion, the given description of the lake, along with the reference to its environment and associated activities, strongly indicate that the lake situated between the mountains of Galilee and Golan is indeed a freshwater lake, and not a saltwater body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth. contains an answer for the question: What was the location of the structure that was built for Marquess of Annandale?, what is it ?

The key phrase here is \\"we reject the holding,\\" which indicates that the current court is overruling the decision made in the Schenck case. Part #2: Identifying a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court Usage: In this sample sentence, there is no explicit reference to a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court. However, the statement \\"we reject the holding\\" suggests that the current court has the authority to overrule the previous decision, implying that the current court is at least the same rank as the court that decided the Schenck case. Thus, it meets the criteria of being a decision by the same or higher ranking court. Part #3: Establishing a different rule on the point of law involved Usage: In the given sentence, the point of law involves the fiduciary duty of introducing brokers. By rejecting the holding from the Schenck case, the current court is effectively establishing a different rule on that point of law. The previous decision stated that there is no fiduciary duty for introducing brokers in certain circumstances, and the current court is disagreeing with that conclusion, which suggests that they are establishing a different rule on this specific legal issue."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster.

It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \\"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \\"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted. To build the houses, he fills a wood frame with tightly packed bales of straw. Next he coats the walls inside and out with layers of clay plaster. He says the common ideas... Question: What can we infer from the passage? Answer: A:","output":"From the passage, we can infer that straw bale houses can be a strong, environmentally-friendly, and cost-effective alternative to traditional home construction materials. The research conducted by Professor Pete Walker's team at the University of Bath suggests that using straw and hemp materials in home construction can lead to energy-efficient homes with good thermal insulation, leading to reduced home operating expenses and less impact on the environment. Additionally, the growing interest in straw bale houses is a response to addressing climate change, and these construction methods are becoming more widely accepted.

Would \\"It was adopted on 18 October 1817.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"While it is true that the flag of Chile, or 'La Estrella Solitaria,' was officially adopted on October 18, 1817, this brief explanation does not adequately detail the process of how the flag was actually created. The flag of Chile consists of three distinct elements: two horizontal bands of white (top) and red, with a blue square at the hoist-side end of the white band, and a white five-pointed star in the center of the blue square. The flag, in its present form, was conceived by Minister Jose Ignacio Zenteno, Secretary of War under Bernardo O'Higgins, a key figure of Chilean independence. The design comprises significant symbolism: the blue square signifies the sky and the Pacific Ocean, the white band indicates the snow-covered Andes, and the red represents the blood that was spilled by those who fought for Chile's independence from Spain. Furthermore, the star within the blue square depicts a guide to progress and honor. Prior to the adoption of the current flag, Chile used a variety of flags associated with its struggle for independence. The current Chilean flag followed the Flag of the Patria Vieja, which was used from 1812 to 1814, and the flag of the transitional period. The flag was created as a symbolic representation of the values, aspirations, and sacrifices of the Chilean people in their fight for independence. So, while 'It was adopted on 18 October 1817.' is factually accurate, it is very simplified and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the creation of the Chilean flag."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: John Charles Wiltshire-Butler (born 1 April 1975), known professionally as John Butler, is an Australian singer, songwriter, and music producer. He is the front man for the John Butler Trio, a roots and jam band, which formed in Fremantle, Western Australia in 1998. The John Butler Trio has recorded five studio albums including three that have reached number one on the Australian charts: Sunrise Over Sea, Grand National and April Uprising. His recordings and live performances have met with critical praise and have garnered awards from the Australian Performing Right Association and Australian Recording Industry Association. Context: The early sessions for the John Butler Trio's sixth studio album commenced in mid-2013, following the band's largest tour of the US. For the first time in the band's lifetime, the members began with a blank songwriting slate, rather than using the initial ideas of Butler that had been introduced. Butler gathered with Luiters and Bomba at The Compound in Fremantle, Western Australia, which serves as the band's headquarters and the frontman's artistic space, and co-wrote material for the first time, deviating from the Butler-centric process of the past: \\"I had always brought the material.\\" After contributing a large portion of work towards the album, Bomba eventually left the Compound space to work on his Melbourne Ska Orchestra project and was replaced by Grant Gerathy.  Butler explained in an interview during the band's US tour:  But a lot of these songs on this album I kind of magpied. Magpies are this bird in Australia that takes shiny things from anywhere and builds its nest, and so that's kind of what I do. I'll take a little of my own experience of having some heavy party time with certain friends, and then I'll hear some other stories about addicts or other intense relationships. I'll put them into the mixing pot and make up these characters to explore different possibilities and emotional landscapes.  One of the songs on the album, \\"Wings Are Wide\\", was written as a dedication to his grandmother, who gave Butler his grandfather's Dobro guitar that became the foundation for his songwriting. Butler admitted that \\"I wasn't at all into roots music or playing the slide or anything when I got it, and it sat under my bed for a long, long time.\\" Released in Australia on 8 February 2014, Flesh and Blood was produced by Jan Skubiszewski and features a vocal duet with Ainslie Wills. Question: Is there an example of a song he magpied ?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there is an example of a song that John Butler \\"magpied\\" during the creation of the John Butler Trio's sixth studio album, Flesh and Blood. In an interview, Butler mentioned that he took inspiration from various sources, including his own experiences and stories of others, to create song characters and explore different emotional landscapes. While he didn't explicitly mention the song's title in the interview, it can be inferred that one such \\"magpied\\" song on the album is \\"Wings are Wide,\\" which he wrote as a dedication to his grandmother. \\"Wings Are Wide\\" is a tribute to his grandmother who gifted him his grandfather's Dobro guitar. This instrument played a significant role in forming the foundation for his songwriting and musical style, even though it initially sat untouched under his bed for a long time. The song was written as an appreciation for his late grandmother and represents the blending of personal experience along with a sense of gratitude and respect for family tradition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

История развития Проблемы рационального управления водными ресурсами и их использования в бассейне Аральского моря возникли еще в 70-80-х годах прошлого столетия (рамка 4.1). Translate to English","output":"4.1.1. The history of development The issue of rational water resource management and their use in the Aral Sea basin emerged as early as the 1970s-1980s (Frame 4.1). The emergence of the problem of rational utilization and management of water resources in the Aral Sea basin can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s. During this period, the growing demand for water resources in the region, coupled with inadequate policies and practices, led to significant environmental degradation and the resulting socio-economic effects. The Aral Sea, once the fourth largest lake in the world, has been shrinking at an alarming rate, mainly due to the excessive diversion of water from its two primary sources, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. This diversion was primarily driven by the intensive agricultural development, particularly of irrigation for cotton production, in the Soviet period. In the 1960s, the Soviet government had sanctioned major irrigation projects, including the construction of a canal network that diverted large volumes of water from the two main rivers to agricultural fields. This increased the demand for water resources manifold in the region, leading to over-extraction and inefficient use of water. The situation was further exacerbated by the lack of effective water management and monitoring systems in place. As a result, by the 1970s and 1980s, the Aral Sea began to experience severe environmental degradation, including a decrease in its area and volume, the increased salt concentration in the water, and the progressive disappearance of its endemic flora and fauna. These changes had profound ripple effects on the surrounding region, such as soil salinization, loss of biodiversity, a decline in fish stocks, increased desertification, and negative impacts on human health and welfare. Recognizing the critical state of the Aral Sea basin and the urgent need for action, the international community started to take notice of the issue. From the mid-1980s onwards, numerous conferences, summits, and workshops were organized to address the issue. These efforts culminated in the establishment of the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC) in 1992, and the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) in 1993, which aimed to facilitate cooperation among the Central Asian states to address the pressing water management issues in the region. Since then, various initiatives and projects have been implemented to restore and improve the condition of the Aral Sea basin. These efforts have primarily focused on improving water management infrastructures, promoting more efficient water use, and restoring ecosystems in the affected areas. Additionally, the international community has also provided financial and technical assistance to help the countries in the region address the complex challenges. Despite the significant progress made over the past decades, the Aral Sea basin remains under tremendous stress due to the ongoing water resource challenges and related environmental and socio-economic consequences. To ensure a sustainable future for the region, it is crucial for the international community and the countries in the basin to continue working together on coherent and long-term measures to improve water management, conserve the ecosystems, and promote sustainable development. In conclusion, the issue of rational water resource management and their use in the Aral Sea basin emerged as early as the 1970s-1980s as a result of inadequate policies and practices during the Soviet era. Since then, various initiatives and measures have been implemented to address the issue, and it continues to be a priority for the region and the international community to ensure a sustainable future."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

If she's looking at the Sun one day and notices less sunspots then she usually sees, what is happening to the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth increasing or decreasing?    Assuming that:  When there are more sunspots the Sun is more active and there are more solar storms and more of the Sun's energy reaches the Earth. Answer:","output":"When Mary notices fewer sunspots than usual, it indicates that the Sun is in a less active phase, and the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth is decreasing. Sunspots are dark, cooler regions on the Sun's surface that are generated by intense magnetic activity. An increase in sunspots typically correlates with heightened solar activity, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), both of which can release significantly more energy into space and towards the Earth. During periods of lower sunspot activity, the Sun's overall energy output, or solar irradiance, may slightly decrease. As a result, the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth is reduced compared to periods when there are more sunspots, and the Sun is more active. However, this effect on the Earth's climate is relatively small compared to other factors like greenhouse gas concentrations and human-related activities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The term is used in contrast with Western Christianity (namely the Latin Church and Protestanism). Eastern Christianity consists of the Christian traditions and churches that developed in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, the Balkans, Southern India and parts of the Far East over several centuries. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots.  - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - An icon (from Greek \\"eikn\\" \\"image\\") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from Eastern Christianity and certain Eastern Catholic churches.

Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating photographs is called photography. The word \\"photograph\\" was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek  (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and  (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\".  - Nicolas Bouvier ( March 6 , 1929 , Lancy -- February 17 , 1998 ) was a 20th - century Swiss traveller , writer , icon painter and photographer .

Heredity means all the characteristics you inherit from your parents. You get your genes from your parents. You inherit half of your genes from your mother. You inherit half of your genes from your father. Genes are a kind of code. A tree's genes tell what shape its leaves will be. A cat's genes tell what color1 its fur will be. Your genes tell what color1 your eyes will be. Your genes tell what color1 your hair will be. Everything about you comes from the code in your genes. Genes line up on strands called chromosomes in cells. Everything alive is made up of cells. Chromosomes are in the center, or nucleus, of cells.   An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first saw inherited patterns in pea plants. He experimented with pea plants in the 1860s. One of the things, or traits  , Mendel studied was what makes some pea plants tall and some short. He said that the traits must come from units of heredity passed from the parent plants. These units were called genes.   In the mid-1900s, scientists discovered that genes are made of DNA. In the 1970s, scientists learned how to change DNA with genetic engineering. Scientists also learned that problems with certain genes cause diseases. Muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and hemophilia are some genetic diseases--diseases caused by problems in genes. Today, scientists are looking for ways to cure genetic diseases by  _ genes through a process called gene therapy.

Article: If your dog looks pleased to see you - it is probably because it loves the particular way you smell. The odour of a familiar human apparently lingers like perfume in the animal's brain - where it triggers an instinctive emotional response, research published yesterday reveals. Our scent acts on a part of the canine brain associated with reward and the strongest reactions are produced by humans that pets know best, say scientists in America. Gregory Berns, of Emory University in Atlanta, said: 'While we might expect that dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of other dogs, it seems that the \\"reward response\\" is reserved for their humans. 'When humans smell the perfume or cologne of someone they love, they may have an immediate, emotional reaction that's not necessarily cognitive. 'Our experiment may be showing the same process in dogs. But since dogs are so much more olfactory  than humans, their responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have. 'It's one thing when you come home and your dog sees you and jumps on you and licks you and knows that good things are about to happen. 'In our experiment, however, the scent donors were not physically present. Why do animals avoid pylons? Because they emit terrifying flashes of light that are INVISIBLE to humans. Dolphins use sponges to protect their sensitive noses while foraging for food on the sea floor 'That means the canine brain responses were being triggered by something distant in space and time. It shows that dogs' brains have these mental representations of us that persist when we're not there.' The university's experiment - the first of its type - involved 12 dogs of various breeds who underwent brain scans while five different scents were placed in front of them. The scent samples came from the subject itself, a dog the subject had never met, a dog that lived in the subject's household, a human the dog had never met, and a human that lived in the subject's household. The familiar human scent samples were taken from someone else... Question: Which of the following is true according to the passage? - The dog's olfactory responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have. - In our experiment, the scent donors were physically present. - Dogs reacted strongest to the scent of a familiar human even when they were there. - Dog's brain responses were not being triggered  by something distant in space and time.

Summarize: Sole guardians of the professional league from 1888 to the Premier League's formation in 1992, the EFL, as it was rebranded in the summer of 2016, is at the centre of the biggest issues affecting the game. BBC Sport spoke to EFL chief executive Shaun Harvey about: After a number of former professional footballers came forward with historical child abuse allegations, Operation Hydrant was set up by the police as an over-arching inquiry. By January, 1,106 cases, implicating 248 clubs, had been referred in what Football Association chairman Greg Clarke called one of the game's biggest crises. Prior to 1992, the Football League was the major domestic league and a number of its member clubs have been implicated. Media playback is not supported on this device Harvey said: \\"This has been exceptionally difficult for football. But let's not forget, it has been a lot more difficult for the individuals who were directly affected. \\"Other than help the victims, we can't do anything that changes the past. But sexual predators exist in our society. We have to make sure, as an industry, we do everything to repel them at our borders. \\"I am satisfied, having seen what goes on today, that we are in an infinitely better place than we were when these historical cases came forward. \\"We will never be complacent. We must put in place a culture that allows parents and players to come forward with anything they feel uncomfortable with so we can deal with these matters in the here and now rather than wait for a 20-year review.\\" There are currently three black managers in charge at the 92 clubs in the top four divisions of the English football pyramid; Brighton's Chris Hughton, Marcus Bignot at Grimsby and Carlisle's Keith Curle. There have been 29 managerial appointments since Bignot replaced Paul Hurst at Grimsby on a six-month rolling contract on 7 November to become the most recent black manager to be given a job. In June 2016, the EFL unanimously approved proposals aimed at tackling the under-representation of coaches and managers from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. The new measures were a version of American football's Rooney Rule and included the introduction of mandatory recruitment practices for coaching positions in academy football and a voluntary recruitment code in first-team football. There has been no change in the number of BAME managers since then. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was sacked by QPR a day before Bignot's appointment. Harvey said: \\"It is apparent the imbalance is there, just on a purely statistical basis. \\"We have set on this process of trying to address the inequality. There is probably further to go but we have moved the dial to a position that is way beyond where we have been in the past. \\"You can't just take a snap shot. The Rooney Rule wasn't an overnight success. It took time. Football needs to be given the same amount of time to achieve the same outcome.\\" In recent months, Leyton Orient, Morecambe, Coventry, Charlton and Blackpool have all experienced large amounts of disquiet amongst their supporters about the ownership of their clubs. At others, including Championship trio Nottingham Forest, Blackburn and Leeds, there is an uneasy relationship between the fans and the owners. Media playback is not supported on this device So, is football's fit and proper persons test for club owners and directors doing its job? Harvey said: \\"It is purely an objective test. It tests against a set of conditions that ask if you are an appropriate person to own, be a director or be a relevant person at a club. That is as far as it goes. It offers no view on skill or ability. It offers no view on judgement. \\"There is always something to be reviewed and we have a responsibility to ensure people are running clubs in their best long term interests. \\"But it is very difficult, unless you get into areas of subjectivity, to start engaging on how someone is going to perform. \\"We also have to be careful that we don't categorise people as good owners or bad owners because fans' views move, usually because of success on the pitch or ticket prices.\\" From 2016-17, parachute payments - the money given to clubs relegated out of the Premier League to prevent them suffering major financial problems given the increased contracts needed to compete in the top flight - are expected to be around £90m per club over a three-year period. It has been suggested they might be reviewed because some promoted teams are choosing not to invest in their squad, knowing they will receive a huge amount of money even if they go down. Harvey said: \\"Yes, the allegation has been made that clubs have got promoted, pocketed the cash, then come back down in a very healthy financial situation. In reality, the number of clubs who come into that category are very small. \\"The real challenge is maintaining a competitive balance. \\"If we can't keep football competitive in the Championship, week in, week out, and clubs don't start the season with a realistic ambition of getting promoted, the competition will eventually die. \\"We can't allow that to happen. Neither can we get into a position where clubs are putting themselves in financial trouble chasing the dream of getting promoted.\\" Prior to 2016-17, when it introduced 'profit and sustainability' rules that would be assessed over three seasons, the EFL's Financial Fair Play regulations were based upon a single season. In 2013-14, clubs that exceeded losses of £8m were subject to a transfer embargo or a fine if they had been promoted. Champions Leicester and play-off winners QPR were fined. Both clubs decided to fight their cases through the courts. Neither has been resolved, with Leicester saying on 2 March they were confident of success. Harvey said: \\"There are ongoing matters with some clubs who didn't meet FFP requirements in the relevant years. Those issues and debates continue. For everybody's benefit, they need to be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. \\"The objective of keeping clubs secure for the long term whilst allowing them the ambition to chase promotion is one most people can agree with. The real challenge is how do you achieve it when you have some owners who would like to be able to spend as much money as they choose and we have some who seek a sustainable model so they don't have to invest as much to stay in the division. \\"We will never find the right balance exactly but the profitability and sustainability model means we should be in a position where clubs' long-term futures are not messed with and everyone is given a chance of getting promoted.\\" In January, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said English football would benefit from allowing the reserve teams of major clubs to compete in the Championship. A similar system applies in Spain, where B teams can be promoted as far as the league below their senior team. In 2016-17, no Spanish B team is higher than the third tier. The concept has been resisted in England. In July 2016, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said it would never happen. Harvey agrees, and now also dismisses the notion of Scotland's Old Firm, Celtic and Rangers, being invited into English football, an idea that was floated when the subsequently scrapped 'Whole Game Solution' was launched in May 2016. Asked if B teams or Celtic and Rangers will ever form part of the English pyramid, he said: \\"As it stands, no. \\"The clubs who are the key to the 92 club professional structure make their views clear each time this conversation is mooted. \\"They want sovereign clubs playing inside our competition. \\"Whilst ever that is the case, it will never change.\\"","output":"The EFL, or English Football League, used to be the major soccer league until the Premier League was formed in 1992. Some big issues affecting soccer are being discussed, and BBC Sport talked to the EFL's chief executive, Shaun Harvey, about them.

This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflection to signify its return to the nest to its mate. Answer:","output":"The Australian raven's flocks make a quiet chattering sound while at rest."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two men have pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges tied to the shooting death of a Chicago teenage girl, who days before had performed at a Washington brunch in the run-up to President Barack Obama's inauguration. Kenneth Williams, 20, and Michael Ward, 18, have been in custody since last month, when a judge ordered that they be held without bond after their first court appearance. On Thursday, they formally pleaded not guilty to a host of charges, the Cook County State Attorney's Office said. The two young men are accused of killing 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton on January 29. Police: Killing was case of mistaken identity. Police said Ward and Williams were gang members seeking revenge against the people who had shot Williams in July, men against whom Williams had refused to press charges when police arrested them. He and Ward thought they had spotted members of a rival gang at the park when police said Ward sneaked up on Hadiya and her friends and began shooting. Williams was the getaway driver, Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy has said. Ward later confessed to shooting Hadiya and two others in a case of mistaken identity, according to McCarthy. He is charged with 141 counts of murder, 10 counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm, eight counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and one count of mob action, according to the Cook County State Attorney's Office. Opinion: Chicago's violence took my dad, friends. Williams, meanwhile, faces 17 counts of murder, 10 counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm, two counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and one count of mob action. The Cook County State Attorney's Office did not return calls from CNN on Friday, seeking an explanation as to why the two men face so many murder charges even though only one person was killed. The Chicago Tribune, citing interviews with legal experts and former prosecutors, said it is not uncommon in Illinois for prosecutors to press a large number of charges -- with the understanding that, as the investigation evolves, many of the charges might be dropped. The newspaper pointed out that William Balfour at one point faced 53 murder charges in the 2008 deaths of three of actress/singer Jennifer Hudson's relatives. He was convicted last May on three counts of first-degree murder. Nurses dodge bullets to provide care in Chicago. Whatever the rationale, Ward's lawyer Jeffrey Granich slammed the 141 murder charges against his client as \\"extreme.\\" He said that, in his 20 years as a practicing lawyer, he's never seen that many murder charges related to the death of a single person. \\"What the prosecutors are trying to do ..., because this is a politically charged case and a case that has gotten a lot of media attention, is to show off how seriously they are taking this case,\\" Granich speculated. \\"Unfortunately, with this indictment, they show not that they are serious, but that they are being absurd.\\" The case helped shine attention on the high murder rate of late in Chicago. It also became intertwined with the national debate over gun violence, with Obama referring to Hadiya's life and death in his latest State of the Union address as her parents looked on.

Plot title: The Passion of the Christ Movie plot: The film opens in Gethsemane in 'medias res as' in the dead of night some hours after the last supper. Jesus prays and is tempted by Satan, while his apostles, Peter, James, and John sleep. After receiving thirty pieces of silver from the highly feared Jewish priests of the Temple in Jerusalem, one of Jesus' other apostles, Judas Iscariot, tells them the location where his teacher is and the priests send a contingent of guards to arrest Jesus for heresy.In the woods outside Gethsemane, Judas approaches with the temple guards and betrays Jesus with a kiss on his cheek. As the guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter intervenes and attacks them, cutting off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards, but Jesus tells Peter to stop with the violence and magically heals Malchus' ear. The temple guards arrest Jesus and the rest of the apostles flee.John runs and tells Jesus' mother, Mary, as well as Mary Magdalene of the arrest, and Peter follows Jesus at a distance who is severely beaten by the Temple guards on their way back to Jerusalem. At the Jewish Temple, the head priest, Caiaphas, holds a trial of Jesus over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the son of God, Jesus replies \\"I am\\". Caiaphas is horrified and tears his robes, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Upon entering the Temple, Peter is confronted by a mob of Jewish spectators who recognize him being one of Jesus followers and confront him. Three times Peter denies knowing Jesus, but then runs away sobbing at his cowardice.Meanwhile, the remorseful Judas attempts to return the money in order have Jesus freed, but he is refused by the priests.

He is best remembered for his four classic horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Whale also directed films in other genres, including what is considered the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity. After the armistice he returned to Birmingham and tried to find work as a cartoonist. He sold two cartoons to the Bystander in 1919 but was unable to secure a permanent position. Later that year he embarked on a professional stage career. Under the tutelage of actor-manager Nigel Playfair, he worked as an actor, set designer and builder, \\"stage director\\" (akin to a stage manager) and director. In 1922, while with Playfair, he met Doris Zinkeisen. They were considered a couple for some two years, despite Whale's living as an openly gay man. They were reportedly engaged in 1924, but by 1925 the engagement was off.  In 1928 Whale was offered the opportunity to direct two private performances of R.C. Sherriff's then-unknown play Journey's End for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, Journey's End gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope's fiancee. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role, but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role, Olivier having accepted an offer to take the lead in a production of Beau Geste. The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play \\"managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like\\". After three weeks at the Savoy, Journey's End transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years.  With the success of Journey's End at home, Broadway producer Gilbert Miller acquired the rights to mount a New York production with an all-British cast headed by Colin Keith-Johnston as Stanhope and Derek Williams as Raleigh. Whale also directed this version, which premiered at Henry Miller's Theatre on 22 March 1929. The play ran for over a year and cemented its reputation as the greatest play about World War I. how many openings did it have?","output":"James Whale's play, Journey's End, had two main openings. First, it opened in London's West End at the Savoy Theatre on January 21, 1929. Then, it had a New York opening at Henry Miller's Theatre on March 22, 1929.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. Each question pertains to different aspects of the show 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'. Let us address each question individually for a thorough explanation. Question 1: Why is Avatar: The Last Airbender not on Netflix? The availability of 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' on Netflix may vary depending on the country or region. As streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video sign contracts and licensing agreements with a variety of content providers, these agreements may limit the platforms from hosting specific shows or films. In some cases, the contract may only include streaming rights for a specified period, and once the contract expires, the streaming platform may face the removal of the content in question. Another factor that affects the availability of a show on a streaming platform is the competitive landscape. Some content producers may opt to release their work on their own streaming platforms or exclusively on other partnerships rather than Netflix. So, if 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' is not on Netflix in your country or region, it is likely because of licensing agreements or decisions made by the content creators. Question 2: Who is Katara in Avatar: The Last Airbender? Katara is a significant character in the animated television series 'Avatar: The Last Airbender.' She is a teenage waterbender from the Southern Water Tribe and the daughter of Hakoda and Kya. Katara has a brother named Sokka, and together, they embark on a journey with Aang, the main protagonist of the series and the last surviving airbender. Katara plays a vital role as the group's main waterbender, responsible for the healing of any injuries and the eventual teaching of waterbending to Aang. Katara is known for her strong sense of morality, passion for justice, and commitment to her family and friends. Throughout the series, Katara's character develops, and she faces personal challenges that ultimately allow her to master not just her waterbending skills but also grow as an individual.

The first question addresses the availability of 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' on Netflix, depending on licensing agreements, while the second question describes Katara, an essential character in the series."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - sewing - sewing machine - art store - frame - livingroom  The rationale to choose \\"sewing\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"Among the given options - sewing, sewing machine, art store, frame, livingroom - the correct one is \\"sewing\\". This is based on the context provided within the question which identifies hobbies related to craftiness with needles.  To begin, let's comprehend each option in relation to the question. The question is asking about a potential hobby someone would have if they're good with needles. We can safely conclude it's referring to a needlework hobby. Hence, the answer is likely going to be a needle-related handicraft. 1. Sewing: This is an action done with needles to connect pieces of fabric or other materials together. It certainly fits the context of someone who is artistic with needles. 2. Sewing Machine: This tool does involve needles and is used in sewing, but it is a tool, not a hobby. Hence, it's not as accurate response as \\"sewing\\". 3. Art Store: This is a place where someone might purchase supplies for various crafts and hobbies, but it's not a hobby unto itself. While one could argue the person may enjoy shopping at art stores, it doesn't directly correlate to craftiness with needles. 4. Frame: A frame is generally used to display completed artwork, like needlepoint or a beautiful piece of sewn fabric. It doesn't involve the use of needles, nor is it a hobby. 5. Livingroom: This is a room in someone's house; it isn't related to needlework or a hobby in itself. Perhaps a person might enjoy crafting in their living room, but the crafting is the hobby, not the room. Hence, the answer is \\"sewing\\". It is the only option that is both a hobby and involves the use of needles. Sewing is a craft that requires precision, skill, and creativity, especially in designing and making clothes, home decor, and assorted other projects. Many people who are good with needles often learn to sew because it is a versatile skill that allows for a high degree of personal expression and practical application. Therefore, the rationale to choose \\"sewing\\" is that it directly relates to the craftiness with needles and is a hobby in itself."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Paragraph: Representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor. There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases. In fact, self-represented litigants - formally called \\"pro se\\" in Latin, or \\"for oneself\\" - in criminal defenses are so rare that statistics about the practice generally are not kept, legal experts say.  Question: \\"Why can representing yourself in court be \\"a tricky endeavor\\"?\\" Answer: \\"Because County officials and private agencies want to make it \\"a tricky endeavor\\"\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: pick from the following. (I). no (II). yes","output":"I. no The answer is incorrect because the paragraph states that representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor due to confusing legal terms, strict procedures, and the need to understand volumes of case law to prepare a case.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer?  In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

Please briefly summarize this news article: Will the Next Attorney General Crack Down on Marijuana? Despite substantial scientific evidence that marijuana is not as harmful as alcohol, many law enforcement officials continue to pretend otherwise. Add to that list Loretta Lynch, President Obama’s nominee for attorney general. In response to a question at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Ms. Lynch pointedly disagreed with Mr. Obama who once told David Remnick of The New Yorker that he didn’t think ingesting the drug was more dangerous than drinking. She said that Mr. Obama was “speaking from his personal experience and personal opinion.” She also said that she did not support marijuana’s legalization. Ms. Lynch’s statements are not all that surprising considering the fact that she spent much of her career as a federal prosecutor in the heady days of the “war on drugs.” Other officials in law enforcement including the current head of the Drug Enforcement Administration hold similar views. But as my colleague Philip Boffey wrote in an editorial in July, the scientific evidence is not on Ms. Lynch’s side. In 2010, for example, a British scientific committee said that alcohol was the most harmful to users and society of the 20 drugs it studied; marijuana ranked eighth, behind heroin, cocaine and tobacco. Ms. Lynch’s views are important because the Department of Justice, which she will head if confirmed, said in 2013 that it would not interfere with the legalization of cannabis in Colorado and Washington as long as those states met several conditions. Since then Oregon and Alaska have also legalized recreational use and the District of Columbia legalized the possession of small amounts. In her hearing, Ms. Lynch did not say if she would try to reverse the department’s policy toward state legalization. But she emphasized that under the existing policy federal officials could still pursue cases to make sure marijuana was not distributed to children, and crack down on transportation of the drug across state lines to places where the drug was not legal. Ms. Lynch’s statements serve as a reminder that the Obama administration’s policy on marijuana could easily be reversed. It would make much more sense for the administration or Congress to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act’s Schedule I and let states decide whether they want to permit its use.","output":"The article ponders upon the possible changes in marijuana policies by the next Attorney General under the Obama administration, specifically Loretta Lynch, President Obama’s nominee for attorney general. Despite research suggesting that marijuana is not as harmful as alcohol, many officials including Lynch continue to hold a different perspective. At her confirmation hearing, she disagreed with President Obama's view that marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol, and expressed her opposition to the drug's legalization. Her views are particularly relevant given the potential role she would play as head of the Department of Justice, which in 2013 announced it would not interfere with the legalization of cannabis in states including Colorado and Washington, provided certain conditions were met. It is however uncertain if she would attempt to reverse this policy. While she did emphasize that under the existing policy, federal officials could still pursue cases to prevent distribution of marijuana to minors and to curb its transportation across state lines to places where it's not legal, the article speculates that Obama’s policy could yet be reversed under her. The author of the article strongly suggests instead that the administration or Congress should remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act’s Schedule I, allowing states to decide its usage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - A prologue or prolog ( Greek  prólogos , from pro , \`\` before '' and lógos , \`\` word '' ) is an opening to a story that establishes the setting and gives background details , often some earlier story that ties into the main one , and other miscellaneous information . The Ancient Greek prólogos included the modern meaning of prologue , but was of wider significance , more like the meaning of preface . The importance , therefore , of the prologue in Greek drama was very great ; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance , to which , or to an episode in which , the play itself succeeded . It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of Euripides , and with him , as has been said , it takes the place of an explanatory first act . This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue , as an impertinence , a useless growth prefixed to the play , and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it . The point precisely is that , to an Athenian audience , it was useful and pertinent , as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible . But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of producing a god out of a machine to justify the action of deity upon man , because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it . He seems , in such a typical prologue as that to the Hippolytus , to be accepting a conventional formula , and employing it , almost perversely , as a medium for his ironic rationalismo .  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - A preface or proem is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author. An introductory essay written by a different person is a \\"foreword\\" and precedes an author's preface. The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work.  - A foreword is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of literature. Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells. Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'subclass of' with the subject 'prologue'.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Answer:","output":"No, the supposed perturbation of more dissolved oxygen being picked up by blood cells does not directly or indirectly affect the process of valley formation. Here's why: 1. The described process focuses on geological formations and erosion, which are primarily influenced by physical factors such as rock type, rainfall, gradient, and the flow path of the river. 2. The perturbation suggested is biological in nature. The amount of dissolved oxygen picked up by blood cells typically impacts bodily functions and processes in living organisms, like respiration and energy production.  3. Even on an ecological level, an increase in the amount of dissolved oxygen in blood cells doesn't directly influence geological processes. While it could potentially affect the organisms living in or around the river, it would not cause significant changes in the river's course, flow, or erosion capabilities, essential factors for the creation or reduction of valleys.

PUBLISHED:. 07:37 EST, 28 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 06:32 EST, 21 November 2013. Allowances: Idreez Popoola, 34, should have been deported in 2006 after his temporary UK visa expired but he was allowed to continue living and working in Britain. An illegal immigrant who was twice spared deportation went on to rape a woman just months after using human rights legislation to remain in the UK. Idreez Popoola, 34, will finally be sent back to his home country of Nigeria when he is released from a seven-year jail term imposed after the attack in the victim’s home. Last night an MP said the case highlighted Britain’s ‘dysfunctional’ border controls. A court heard that Popoola came to the UK on a 12-month visa in 2005, but when it expired he was given permission to remain on a temporary basis. But when Popoola was arrested by Northamptonshire Police in December 2011 over an allegation of assault he was found to be an ‘overstayer’ – an immigrant who had not left the country by an agreed date. Although no charges followed the alleged assault, Popoola – by now married with a child – was told he would be deported. However, he successfully appealed the ruling, arguing that the Human Rights Act provided him with the right to a family life. Northampton Crown Court heard that Popoola, who worked as a nightclub bouncer, was granted temporary leave to remain in the UK again in January last year, after his family circumstances were taken into account. But 11 months later he went on to brutally rape a woman in her own home. Bouncer: The court heard Popoola met his victim while working as an agency-employed bouncer outside Bar So in Northampton town centre. Popoola, who sold mobile phone top-up. cards in Nigeria before moving to the UK, is thought to have lived in. Oxford before settling in Thornton Heath, South London, where he trained. as a bouncer and gained work with an agency which supplied a. Northampton nightclub. Judges granted Popoola the temporary right to stay in the UK because he had family just days before he raped a woman in her home. Gordon. Aspden, prosecuting, said Popoola met his victim at a McDonald’s. restaurant in the town. After going back to her home he attacked her,. then forced her to drive him to a train station. Popoola was sentenced to seven years after being found guilty of rape following a four-day trial. Judge. Lynn Tayton told him: ‘It was a serious aggravating factor that the. rape took place in the victim’s own home, as this was an abuse of the. trust placed in you by the victim and has undermined her feelings of. safety in her own space.’ Michael Ellis, Tory MP for Northampton North, said: ‘This is an example of the dysfunctional border control in the UK. ‘Although. there has been considerable improvement since this government took. over, the previous regime was completely not fit for purpose. ‘Here. is another example of someone who has gone on to commit a serious and. unforgivable act when they shouldn’t have even been in the country at. all.’ Alp Mehmet, deputy chairman of the Migration Watch UK pressure. group, said: ‘The sensible course of action, in respect of anyone. without a right to be here, is to remove them as speedily as possible.’ A. Home Office spokesman said: ‘We have introduced tough new rules to. protect the public from those who try to stay here through abuse of the. Human Rights Act. 'Our Immigration Bill will give the full force of. legislation to our policy that foreign criminals should ordinarily be. deported despite their claim to a family life.' Guilty: Popoola was jailed for seven years at Northampton Crown Court after he was found guilty of rape following a four day trial last month. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Article:At the height of the conflict between the Colombian government and left-wing Farc guerrillas, Mr Bermudez - then a 26-year-old policeman - was on patrol in a rural area in the south of the country when he stepped on a land mine. The explosion left him completely blind and with terrible facial injuries. Eleven years and dozens of medical procedures later, Mr Bermudez is no longer angry with the guerrillas who probably laid the mine that maimed him but he is frustrated with a deeply divided society, which he says has missed a chance to move on and pursue a lasting peace. \\"If I and all the other victims of violence can find the strength to forgive and to compromise then those people, sitting behind their desks in the cities, who have not suffered in the same way can surely do the same,\\" Mr Bermudez tells me in his modest Bogota home. He lives here with his wife and two young daughters, children he has never seen because of his blindness and whom he dotes on. Scrapping by on a police pension and as a part-time musician, Mr Bermudez worries about what kind of country his girls will grow up in now that a peace deal between the government and the Farc guerrillas hangs in the balance after Colombians' surprise rejection of the deal in a referendum on Sunday. 'Fundamental flaw' Other Colombians are more optimistic, even interpreting the \\"no\\" vote as a positive development. Jaime Castro is a former mayor of Bogota and was a prominent campaigner against accepting the agreement that had taken four years to negotiate. \\"The fundamental flaw with President [Juan Manuel] Santos' strategy was that it was a single-party, political approach rather than a national policy,\\" says Mr Castro. \\"If what we now end up with is a multi-party solution, acceptable to everyone, it could strengthen the process.\\" Earlier this week I took a short stroll through La Candelaria, the old colonial quarter of Bogota. There is plenty of poverty, misery and crime in Bogota - like any other Latin American metropolis - but the Colombian capital is a much safer and more tranquil place than I remember when I first started reporting from here in the 1990s. Indeed no one wants a return to the violence that ravaged the country and its institutions for decades. Juana Acosta was an adviser to the peace talks, which were held in the Cuban capital, Havana. She worked specifically on the issue of justice and political participation. It is one of the most contentious parts of the existing agreement and Ms Acosta admits that it is probably one of the main reasons why it was narrowly defeated in the referendum. \\"Which former guerrillas, who are accused of abuses and violations, will be allowed to take part in the political process and what punishment they must serve for their crimes is one key area that Farc negotiators are going to have to look at again,\\" Ms Acosta tells me. The adviser, who hopes to be returning to Havana for fresh talks, added: \\"Colombian society cannot allow again the presence of child soldiers. We cannot allow again atrocities against the civilian population. We are not prepared again to live through such violence so we're going to have to find a way through this and to sign a new peace agreement.\\" Those close to the talks, like Ms Acosta, realise that time is now a crucial factor. In recent weeks and months, thousands of Farc guerrilla fighters have been gathering in jungle camps, preparing to hand over their weapons and uniforms. The plan was for them to rejoin society after demobilising, receiving guaranteed monthly payments from the state and limited immunity from prosecution. But after the result of the plebiscite, no one is really sure what will happen next. The longer the hiatus remains, the greater the risk that the Farc members will sink back into the jungle, re-arm, perhaps join other smaller left-wing organisations or criminal gangs making money from the drugs trade. For now all sides say they are committed to peace but in his latest pronouncement, President Santos warned that a mutually agreed ceasefire between his government and the Farc would expire at the end of October. While Colombia's ministry of defence has since said that the ceasefire can be extended again beyond that date, Mr Santos' statement was interpreted as a thinly veiled warning to negotiators that they would have only weeks to put their heads together and resubmit a modified agreement. The president's words also elicited an ominous response from the Farc leadership, with the question; \\"What happens when the ceasefire expires? Does the fighting start all over again?\\" It is a thought most Colombians, especially people like Edgar Bermudez, who have suffered so much already, dare not contemplate. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article narrates the story of Edgar Bermudez, a victim of a landmine blast, who is concerned about the future of Colombia after the country's surprise rejection of the peace deal between the government and the FARC guerrillas in a recent referendum. The political atmosphere has been polarized, and the rejection of the peace deal has left many feeling uncertain about the future of the country. Jaime Castro, a former mayor of Bogota, believes the \\"no\\" vote to be a positive development, stating that a multi-party solution, acceptable to everyone, could strengthen the process. However, Juana Acosta, an adviser to the peace talks, acknowledges that the existing agreement's most contentious parts need to be revisited for a successful peace deal to come to fruition. The rejection of the agreement has led to concerns over the demobilized FARC fighters rearming and rejoining smaller left-wing organizations or engaging in drug trade. The stakes are high, and the timeline for renegotiating the peace deal looks limited, with both sides committed to peace for now."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The best answer in the given choices would be \\"very deadly,\\" as it is directly related to the consequences of faulting of rocks in Earth's crust leading to earthquakes. However, this answer choice only covers one aspect of the results of faulting of rocks, and it is important to understand that there are several other consequences and processes related to it. Faulting of rocks in the Earth's crust is the fracturing or breaking of the Earth's surface due to the shifting of tectonic plates. This can cause several phenomena, such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the creation of new landforms. The movement, deformation, and fracturing of rocks near the fault line have significant implications for the surrounding environment and the planet as a whole. Some of the consequences of the faulting of rocks in Earth's crust include: 1. Earthquakes: As the tectonic plates move and interact with each other, energy builds up along the fault lines. This energy is eventually released, causing the ground to shake and move, sometimes resulting in very deadly and destructive natural disasters. 2. Mountain-building: The movement of tectonic plates can result in compression, leading to the formation of mountain ranges. This can alter the landscape and change the regular patterns of erosion and sedimentation in adjacent areas. 3. Basin formation: As the rocks are pulled apart along the fault lines, depressions, or basins can be created. These basins can eventually fill up with water, creating lakes or seas. 4. Uplift and subsidence: The faulting of rocks can lead to uplifting or subsidence of the Earth's crust, leading to changes in elevation and topography. 5. Formation of fault-block landforms: The movement of large blocks of crust vertically along fault lines can lead to the creation of new landforms such as fault-block mountains and rift valleys. 6. Volcanic activity: The movement of tectonic plates can create volcanic activity, as magma from the Earth's mantle is able to move closer to the surface and erupt through fractures and cracks. 7. Mineral and resource deposits: Faulting of rocks can lead to the exposure and concentration of valuable minerals and resources, creating economic opportunities for mining and extraction. In conclusion, while the earthquakes resulting from the faulting of rocks in Earth's crust can indeed be very deadly, it is crucial to understand the broader context of related geological processes and consequences. The movement and interaction of tectonic plates, faulting, and fracturing of the Earth's crust have significant impacts on our planet's geology, landscape, and human society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Gilgamesh has been not reading the cuneiform tablets.","output":"The sentence \\"Gilgamesh has been not reading the cuneiform tablets\\" is a somewhat awkward construction, but it can still be understood. For a more linguistically acceptable and natural-sounding version, the sentence should be rephrased for better clarity and grammatical accuracy. There are generally two ways to express negation in the present perfect continuous tense: 1. Using \\"not\\": The first and more common way is to place \\"not\\" before the auxiliary verb. In this case, \\"has\\" is the auxiliary verb being used, so \\"not\\" should be placed immediately after \\"has.\\" This creates a contraction \\"hasn't\\" (has not). Here's the corrected sentence: Gilgamesh hasn't been reading the cuneiform tablets. 2. Using \\"no\\": Another way of expressing a negation with an emphasis on the lack of activity is by using \\"no\\" before the gerund (the -ing form of the verb). This is less common, and it may sound less natural in some instances. However, it's still grammatically correct: Gilgamesh has been reading no cuneiform tablets. Both versions above are linguistically acceptable, with the first one being the most commonly used and considered more natural by native English speakers. It is important to remember that the placement of \\"not\\" directly before the main verb can often lead to awkward or confusing sentence structures, so putting \\"not\\" after the auxiliary verb is a safer choice for creating clear and understandable negations."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Given the question: Given the following context:  Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Avoid heat while your ankle recovers. Heat increases blood flow to the injured area and aggravates inflammation. Warm compresses, saunas, and steam showers may do more harm than good in the first three days after your injury occurs. Stay away from heat during this time and stick to cold compresses to help relieve pain and swelling. Do not drink any alcohol while you are recovering. Alcoholic drinks open up the blood vessels in the body. When your blood vessels open up, the swelling in your ankle can become much worse. Alcohol will also delay the healing process, so it is a good idea to avoid it while you recover. Stay away from running and other physical activities to make sure that your ankle heals. Running and other high impact physical activities will only make things worse. Rest for at least one week before resuming exercise. Do not massage your ankle for at least a week. While massaging the pain away in your ankle might sound like a good idea, giving your ankle a massage will just add external pressure to your injury. This external pressure will actually make the swelling worse. You can start to gently massage your ankle one week after you have allowed your ankle to rest and recover.

Campbell secretly tasks Kuttner's crew to bring back pieces of the Marker, which are worth millions of credits per kilo. The group land on Aegis VII, which is now unstable. While the engineers work the gravity stabilizer, Kuttner's crew separate. Kuttner finds a Marker shard, which causes a horrifying hallucination, making him murderously unstable. He damages the stabilizer before his teammates can tie him up in the shuttle. After finishing his interrogation Kuttner is able to escape and follows a phantom of Vivian out of an airlock, killing several marines.

The UCL Academy introduced the later start when it opened in September. This comes after research shows that teens don't wake up before 10. Pupils have been more alert and engaged in lessons, according to the school. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The UCL Academy's Later Start Times: A Beneficial Shift for Teen Students Introduction The UCL Academy, a prestigious educational institution in London, introduced a significant change in its daily timetable when it opened up its doors to students in September. The decision to start the school day later, at 10 a.m., is based on scientific research that shows teenagers are not well-rested and mentally prepared for learning before this time. Early results indicate that this shift in schedule has a noticeably positive impact on students' attentiveness and overall engagement in lessons. The Science Behind Later Start Times There has been a growing concern among educators, parents, and researchers about the impact of traditional school start times on adolescent students, particularly in their teenage years. Studies have revealed that teenagers' unique circadian rhythms, which control their sleep-wake cycles, tend to shift as they enter puberty. This change makes it harder for them to fall asleep early and wake up feeling refreshed before 10 a.m. According to sleep experts, the melatonin hormone, which plays a significant role in regulating sleep, shows an altered secretion pattern in teenagers. This alteration causes teens to feel alert at a later time at night and consequently, makes them drowsy in the mornings. It is important to note that insufficient sleep in teens has been linked to lower academic performance, increased anxiety and depression, and higher risks of obesity and car accidents. The UCL Academy's Approach Faced with such evidence, the UCL Academy decided to take the bold step of starting the school day at 10 a.m. This allowed students to arrive at school feeling more awake, alert, and prepared to engage in the learning process. Students adopted the new schedule enthusiastically and quickly adapted to the change. Positive Outcomes and Educator Perspectives Teachers and school administrators at the UCL Academy have reported numerous benefits and improvements in their students' behavior and performance since implementing the later start time. Pupils are more attentive during lessons and have increased focus and concentration. This heightened engagement in the educational process has led to a more dynamic classroom environment where students are active participants rather than passive listeners. Moreover, the change in schedule has also indirectly created a positive impact on students' mental health by allowing them adequate time to rest and recharge. The reduced levels of fatigue have helped them cope better with academic pressure, leading to a decline in stress-related issues. Future Directions and Implications The positive results experienced by the UCL Academy highlight the importance of considering individual students' needs when designing school schedules. As more schools around the world follow suit and experiment with later start times, researchers and educators will be keen to monitor their long-term impact on academic achievement, student well-being, and overall development. The potential benefits of a later school start time should encourage other institutions to reevaluate their current schedules and make adjustments that prioritize student health and optimal learning. By acknowledging and addressing the unique physiological and psychological challenges faced by teenage students, we can cultivate a more supportive educational environment that nurtures their growth and success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  The opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of the \\"fugitive\\" motif. The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance. This leads to the first of the \\"Grand Tunes\\", Cavaradossi's \\"Recondita armonia\\" with its sustained high B flat, accompanied by the sacristan's grumbling counter-melody. The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \\"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.After Tosca's \\"Non la sospiri\\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \\"Qual'occhio\\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \\"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\\". The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the \\"fugitive\\" motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his investigation. In Scarpia's exchanges with Tosca the sound of tolling bells, interwoven with the orchestra, creates an almost religious atmosphere, for which Puccini draws on music from his then...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person that wrote the Recondita armonia in a high B flat?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: I could not have said it better myself. Sentence 2: You put it in the best way possible. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we need to analyze the meaning and implications of both sentences. Sentence 1: \\"I could not have said it better myself.\\" This sentence implies that the speaker believes someone has expressed an idea, opinion, or statement in an optimal or superior way. The speaker acknowledges that they personally could not have conveyed the message more effectively. Sentence 2: \\"You put it in the best way possible.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is praising someone for expressing a thought, opinion, or statement in the most optimal manner possible. The implication here is that there is no better way to convey the message than the one that the person used. Now, let's examine the entailment relationship between the two sentences. Entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another. In other words, if sentence A entails sentence B, then whenever sentence A is true, sentence B must also be true. In this case, if Sentence 1 is true (i.e., the speaker could not have said it better themselves), it implies that someone else has expressed the idea in an exceptional way. This idea aligns with Sentence 2, where the speaker explicitly praises someone for expressing an idea in the best way possible. Given the analysis above, we can conclude that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. When the speaker says, \\"I could not have said it better myself,\\" it inherently suggests that the other person put it in the best way possible. Although the two sentences are different in structure, their meanings are closely related, revealing that the truth of the first statement guarantees the truth of the second."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Although the response provides information about a specific event during which France defended the Fortress of Louisbourg, it does not fully answer the question of how the French defended the fortress in a general sense.  To provide a more satisfactory answer, let's analyze the French defensive strategies and fortifications: Step 1: Study the fortress design The Fortress of Louisbourg was strategically designed for defense. Key elements included walls made of solid masonry, bastions for efficient cannon placement, and several gun batteries that prevent enemy ships from approaching the fortress. Step 2: Assess the garrison The presence of a well-trained French army garrison, including soldiers, sailors, and other personnel, also played a crucial role in defending the fortress. The total number of troops reinforced the defenses, deterring potential attacks. Step 3: Evaluate the geographical location The fortress's location on the eastern coast of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, coupled with its natural surroundings, provided additional defense. The rocky coast made it difficult for larger ships to get close, hindering enemy ground assaults, while the harbor entrance was narrow and guarded by powerful naval artillery. Step 4: Establish alliances The French maintained alliances with local native tribes, who provided valuable support during conflicts and skirmishes around the fortress. These alliances also gave the French an advantage in reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. Taking these steps into account, the French defended the Fortress of Louisbourg through a combination of fortress design, a well-maintained garrison, utilizing the advantageous geographical location, and establishing strategic alliances with native tribes in the region."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: \\"What are negative features of the women who want Scout to be more feminine?\\"  Context: \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Some negative features of the women who want Scout to be more feminine in the given context are: 1. They promote racist and classist points of view: The women who criticize Scout's lack of adherence to a feminine role often hold prejudiced beliefs. For instance, Mrs. Dubose not only chastises Scout for her appearance but also insults Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. 2. They uphold traditional gender roles: These women expect Scout to conform to the standard gender norms prevalent in their society. They criticize her for not wearing dresses and behaving in a manner they perceive as feminine, and try to pressure her into adhering to those expectations. 3. They can be judgmental and narrow-minded: These women judge Scout based on her appearance and behavior, without considering her unique qualities, independence, or intelligence. They seem to value conformity more than individualism. 4. They may lack empathy or understanding: The women who criticize Scout for not being feminine enough often do not take the time to understand her perspective, experiences, or reasons for her choices. They are quick to judge and dismiss her as a misfit without considering the complexities of her character and situation. Overall, the negative features of the women who want Scout to be more feminine include their prejudiced views, rigid adherence to traditional gender roles, judgmental attitudes, and lack of empathy. These characteristics ultimately clash with Scout's upbringing and the positive role models she has in Calpurnia and Miss Maudie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can I make a landing page with Launchrock and link it with my domain name? How do I host a website page and link them to a domain name? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information, but they are related. The first question is specifically about creating a landing page using Launchrock and linking it to a domain name, while the second question is about hosting a website page in general and linking it to a domain name. I will provide detailed answers to both questions. 1. Can I make a landing page with Launchrock and link it with my domain name? Yes, you can create a landing page with Launchrock and link it to your custom domain name. Launchrock is a platform that helps you build landing pages to collect email addresses and generate early interest in your products or services. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create a landing page with Launchrock and link it to your domain name: Step 1: Sign up for Launchrock Visit the Launchrock website (https://www.launchrock.com/) and sign up for an account. You can choose from their free plan or opt for one of the paid plans for more features. Step 2: Create your landing page After signing up, you will be taken to the Launchrock dashboard. Click on \\"Create New Site\\" and choose a template for your landing page. Customize the template to match your preferences, including colors, fonts, images, and content. Be sure to preview your changes as you go. Step 3: Set up a custom domain To connect your landing page to your custom domain name, go to your Launchrock dashboard and select your site. Click on \\"Settings\\" and then \\"Domain,\\" where you will see an option to add a custom domain. Step 4: Configure your domain registrar Log into your domain registrar's account (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.). You will need to create a CNAME record that points your custom domain to Launchrock. The exact steps to create a CNAME record may vary depending on your registrar, but it typically involves navigating to the domain's DNS settings and adding a new record with a designated host and target. For Launchrock, the target should be \\"sites.launchrock.com.\\" Step 5: Verify your domain Once you have set up the CNAME record, return to the Launchrock dashboard and click on \\"Verify\\" in the custom domain settings. It may take some time for the domain to propagate, so if verification does not work immediately, wait a while and try again. Step 6: Publish your landing page When your custom domain is verified, you can publish your landing page by clicking on \\"Publish\\" at the top of the Launchrock dashboard. 2. How do I host a website page and link them to a domain name? To host a website and link it to a domain name, you will need a hosting provider, a domain registrar, and your website files. Here is a step-by-step guide: Step 1: Choose a hosting provider A hosting provider is a company that offers server space for storing your website files and makes them accessible to users on the internet. Some popular hosting providers include Bluehost, SiteGround, and HostGator. Choose a plan that suits your needs and sign up for an account. Step 2: Register a domain name A domain name is the URL that users will type into their browser to visit your website (e.g., www.example.com). You can register a domain name with a domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains. Search for an available domain name and register it through your chosen registrar. Step 3: Connect your domain to your hosting provider To link your domain name to your hosting provider, you will need to update your domain's DNS settings. Log in to your domain registrar and look for the option to manage your domain's DNS settings. Update the nameservers to the ones provided by your hosting provider. This change may take some time to propagate, so be patient. Step 4: Upload your website files Once your domain is pointing to your hosting provider, log in to your hosting account and locate the file manager or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) access. Upload your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to the appropriate directory on your hosting server, usually called \\"public_html\\" or \\"htdocs.\\" Step 5: Test your website Once your files are uploaded, visit your domain name in your web browser to ensure that your website is accessible and functioning as expected. In summary, while both questions are related to creating and hosting a website or landing page, the first question pertains specifically to using Launchrock for the process, whereas the second question addresses the general steps involved in hosting any website and linking it to a domain name."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.  Two women go into a doctor's office for a routine physical. As is usual for a physical, the doctor takes a blood sample from both women to analyze for any issues.

Disclaimer: This is review is for the SUSHI BAR ONLY   Went here last Saturday and stopped in for a quick bite at the sushi bar, mainly to try it out because I've heard so many good things about Nakama.   To be honest, my experience was exactly like the two star Yelp rating means: Meh. I've experienced better.  Two of the 4 rolls I ordered were loosely made which as a sushi lover I found to be kinda unacceptable. One had an end piece that frankly would have gotten the sushi chef a failing grade by anyone's standards - it was falling apart and had nothing but rice and paper on it despite this being a fairly pricey signature roll. One of my sushi pieces was similarly falling apart - the rice hadn't been packed enough and the salmon was just slapped on there.   I would even have sent those back if I could have found a waitress or been able to hear myself think. They were just too crowded to give the proper amount of love to each dish, and as you know, a dish prepared without love is bound to be lacking.  The noise and my seat in relation to the crowded door area just made me want to get out of there. I was bumped several times by people weaving their way past each other, at one point someone bumped my elbow as I was raising a cup of hot sake. Hmm ... a splash of hot sake? ... let's say it's not my favorite sensation in the crotch area.  Anyway, the staff was friendly when you were able to flag someone down and I am sure everyone was doing their best, but think this place is highly overrated - making it over crowded - making the whole experience that much less enjoyable for everyone.  Hope your experience is better than mine - the place should have been better from what I've been told by Nakama fans. Good luck!! Is this review positive or negative?","output":"This review is negative.

Article: Should e-cigarettes (electronic cigarettes) be a new choice for the smokers trying to get rid of the habit? Reactions from Americans are mixed. More than half of the people questioned in a survey think e-cigarettes should be controlled by the US Food and Drug Administration, but 47 percent believe the e-cigarettes should be available to the smokers who want to quit. \\"In the hunt for a safter cigarette, e-cigarettes are becoming a popular choice among those either trying to quit.\\"or looking to replace standard tobacco smoke with an alternative that manufacturers claim to be safer, \\"Zogby International, which conducted the survey, said in a statement. About half of the 4,611 adults who took part in the survey had heard about e-cigarettes, which are battery-powered, or rechargeable cigarettes that vaporize a liquid nicotine solution. They do not produce smoke but a water vapor without smell. Sold mostly on the Internet, e-cigarettes were first made in China. Last year the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against using e-cigarettes, saying there was no evidence to prove they were safe or helped smokers break the habit. The WHO said people who smoke e-cigarettes breathe in a fine fog of nicotine into the lungs. Nearly a third of people questioned in the survey think that e-cigarettes should be allowed in places where smoking is forbidden, because they don't produce smoke, but 46 percent disagree. Men who were aware of the availability of e-cigarettes were more likely than woman to say they should be a choice available to smokers who want to quit. Young people, aged 18-29, and singles were the groups most open to trying e-cigarettes. Smoking is the single largest cause of preventable death worldwide, according to the WHO.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Drunken driving--sometimes called America's socially accepted form of murder--has become a national epidemic . Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years. A drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter  has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant. Twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing  a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21. Reformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \\"responsible attitudes\\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink. Though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \\"obviously drunk\\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy. As the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition  of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \\"noble experiment\\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution. Question: What can be inferred from the fact of the traffic accidents in New Jersey? - The legal drinking age should be raised. - Young drivers were usually bad. - Most drivers hoped to raise the legal drinking age. - Drivers should not be allowed to drink. A:","output":"The best answer that can be inferred from the fact of the traffic accidents in New Jersey is: The legal drinking age should be raised.

The small town of Gullane to the east of Edinburgh that is all set to welcome the modern titans of the game for the 142nd staging of the British Open played host to a true pioneer back in 1896. Harry Vardon won a total of six British Open titles, a record that still stands, but his achievements in the game stretch far beyond his haul of majors, which was lifted to seven by his 1900 U.S. Open triumph.

The argument goes something like this: The entire passage discusses the sport of golf and focuses particularly on the exploits of Harry Vardon. Vardon is hailed as a champion for winning six British Open titles, a record that still stands, and his other major achievements, most notably his U.S. Open victory in 1900. The sentence \\"Had someone won seven or even six Opens we wouldn't have had\\" is a speculative statement and is missing an ending that aligns with the context of the passage. The context clues provided throughout the extract suggest that the passage is looking to compare or contrast another entity or individual with the achievements of Harry Vardon. None of the other options, such as 'America', 'CNN', or 'Edinburgh', are appropriate, as they have nothing to do with golf championships, which is the central theme of the passage. Therefore, when considering the context of golf and the major achievements in the British Open, the most logical completion would be \\"Had someone won seven or even six Opens we wouldn't have had Harry Vardon as a God.\\" This would suggest that if someone else had matched or surpassed Vardon's achievements, Vardon might not have been held in such high esteem. His extraordinary record set him apart, and had someone else achieved as much, his legacy might not have been as profound, festooned with an almost deific reverence, hence the use of the term 'God'."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: Process:  - The air is cold - Water is in the air - The water forms tiny ice crystals - The ice crystals collide with each other - The ice crystals stick to each other - The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - The ice crystals become snowflakes - The snow flakes fall to the ground as snow.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose air is more cold happens, how will it affect less ice crystals stick together.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which is the air becoming even colder, may have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process of ice crystals sticking together. Step-by-step justification: 1. The air is colder than before: In the perturbation hypothesis, the air is assumed to be colder than in the initial process. This change may affect how water particles interact in the air. 2. Water is still in the air: The fact that water remains in the air doesn't change, but the colder temperature may influence the rate at which water molecules join together to form ice crystals. 3. Ice crystals forming: Colder air may cause ice crystals to form more quickly, as water particles will be more likely to freeze upon contact with other particles due to the lower temperature. 4. Ice crystals colliding with each other: The increased rate of ice crystal formation may lead to more frequent collisions between ice crystals, affecting how they stick together. 5. Ice crystals sticking together: The perturbation hypothesis suggests that fewer ice crystals will stick together in colder air. This could be due to the colder air causing the outer surfaces of ice crystals to freeze more quickly, making it harder for them to bond with other ice crystals. 6. Ice crystals getting bigger: With fewer ice crystals sticking together, there may be smaller snowflakes formed, potentially affecting the overall appearance and volume of snowfall. 7. Ice crystals becoming too heavy: The ice crystals or snowflakes still eventually become too heavy to remain in the air and will fall to the ground. 8. Snowfall: The snowflakes will still fall to the ground as snow, but the perturbation might result in changes to the appearance, size, or volume of the snowfall due to the altered behavior of ice crystals in colder air. So, the perturbation of colder air does have an effect on the process leading to the formation of snow, mainly through altering the behavior of ice crystals and how they stick together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Baran Movie plot: It is winter in Teheran. Lateef is 17. He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard...","output":"Based on the movie plot of Baran, it does not explicitly mention Lateef refusing money. However, his actions and motivations throughout the film suggest that his primary concern is not about money, but rather his feelings towards Rahmat and his desire to help and protect her. Lateef's decision to locate Soltan to get news about Rahmat also indicates that his focus is more on Rahmat's wellbeing than on his own financial gain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- As the Olympic flame burned above Sochi on Tuesday evening, a scene of mayhem and death exploded a few hundred miles away in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, where blazes roared and violent clashes erupted along protesters' barricades. At least 100 people were killed just on Thursday and hundreds more hospitalized in confrontations pitting government forces against demonstrators opposed to a regime that has strong support from President Vladimir Putin's Russia. It was the deadliest day in the three months since the showdown started. Between the two spectacles, you can bet Putin's attention focused more sharply on the crisis in Ukraine, which is officially an independent country since 1991 but in reality remains a state over which Moscow exercises enormous influence, infuriating much of Ukraine's population. To Putin, staging a successful","output":"Olympics in Sochi represented a showcase for Russia's resurgence as a global power and a confirmation of his strong leadership. He was counting on the world's attention to be on the sporting events and the achievements of the athletes, not on the escalating unrest in a neighboring country. However, the violence in Kiev and the rising death toll were impossible to ignore. Just as the Sochi Olympics were about to end, the crisis in Ukraine reached a boiling point, with protesters not only demanding the ousting of then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who had strong ties to Moscow, but also seeking closer ties with the European Union. In the days following the bloodshed, the Ukrainian parliament voted to remove President Yanukovych from office and issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of \\"mass murder of peaceful citizens.\\" Yanukovych fled to Russia, where he was granted protection. The events in Ukraine forced Putin to shift his focus from Sochi's Olympics to a political crisis that threatened his influence in the region. In response to the turmoil, Putin took a series of aggressive measures, including the annexation of Crimea, a region in Ukraine with a predominantly ethnic Russian population, in March 2014. The move sparked international outrage and sanctions against Russia. Forced to manage the crisis in Ukraine, Putin sought to achieve the following objectives: 1. Regain control over Crimea and assert Russian influence in the region. 2. Prevent Ukraine from moving closer to the European Union and Western alliances, which he perceived as a threat to Russia's national security. 3. Maintain Russia's strategic Black Sea fleet based in Crimea. 4. Bolster nationalist sentiment in Russia and reinforce his image as a strong and decisive leader. The situation in Ukraine deteriorated further, as pro-Russian separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk declared independence from Ukraine and engaged in a conflict with Ukrainian forces. This fueled a prolonged and bloody war that has claimed thousands of lives and displaced over a million civilians. The tension between Russia and the West was further exacerbated by the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in July 2014 over eastern Ukraine, which killed 298 people. International investigators concluded that the plane was shot down by a Russian-supplied missile. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement and blamed Ukraine for the tragedy. Despite efforts by the international community to find a diplomatic solution, the conflict in Ukraine remains unresolved. Due to Russia's annexation of Crimea and the ongoing fighting in eastern Ukraine, Putin's role on the global stage has been characterized by increasing tension and discord with Western powers, which has led to a new era of geopolitical rivalry. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story highlights how the Sochi Olympics' success was overshadowed by the escalating crisis in Ukraine, which forced Putin to focus on securing Russian interests in the region. The ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kyiv has had significant geopolitical repercussions, causing the unraveling of relations between Russia and the West, and shaping the international landscape in a manner reminiscent of the Cold War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Bamboo plants are typically classified as clumping bamboo, running bamboo, or reeds.  Reeds are rarely planted in yards, if ever, so you can expect to deal with either clumping or running bamboo. Running bamboo sends out rhizomes, which spread into other areas, causing the plant to become invasive. Clumping bamboo grows in tight clusters and rarely spreads out over larger areas. Most bamboo varieties do best in tropical climates, but if you live in a somewhat cooler area, there are a few hardier varieties you can attempt to grow with some success.  If you living in warmer hardiness zones, like zones 7 through 10, a few good choices might be Bambusa multiplex ‘Alphonse Karr’, Borinda boliana, and Phyllostachys nigra. The first two are clump bamboo types, while the last is running bamboo. For slightly cooler climates, like those found in hardiness zones 5 and 6, try the clumping type Fargesia dracocephala ‘Rufa’ or the running type Pleioblastus viridistriatus. Bamboo needs a great deal of sun, so you should usually pick a spot in your yard that receives 8 or more hours of sun daily. Note that some tropical species do require shade during the hottest parts of the day, however. Shade can be especially important during winter. The combination of frost and direct sunlight can dehydrate the plant quickly. As such, if you live in an area that receives frost during winter, you should opt for a spot that receives partial shade instead of one with direct sun. While bamboo can do well in many types of soil, it does best in loam or marly soils. Improve your odds of success by digging and mixing in amendments to the soil before planting.  Work garden compost or manure into the soil to provide it with additional nutrients. Ideally, the compost should be worked into the bottom of the transplant hole so that the bamboo roots sit on top of it. Loam soil is a mixture of five parts topsoil composted with two parts sand, two parts silt, and one part clay. Avoid rocky or soggy soils, as well as soils that are relatively impermeable. Bamboo has a shallow root system, yet it also grows tall and fast. As a result, it can easily get damaged by strong winds. You will need a barrier to prevent this from happening. The easiest way to protect your bamboo is to position them behind garden hedges or trees. Otherwise, you might need to build a fence around the area. If you are planting running bamboo, you will need to construct a barrier to prevent the bamboo from invading other parts of your yard. After determining the area in which you want to confine the bamboo, install barriers of sheet metal or concrete around the perimeter. These barriers should be 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) deep. What is a summary?","output":"Bamboo plants are mainly classified into clumping and running varieties, with the latter being invasive due to their spreading rhizomes. They thrive best in tropical climates, but some hardier types can be grown in cooler areas too. Key factors for successfully growing bamboo include choosing the right species for your hardiness zone, picking a location with optimal sunlight (potentially partial shade in areas prone to frost), and preparing the soil with proper amendments like garden compost or manure. Loam or marly soils are ideal. To protect the bamboo from damage due to strong winds, plant them behind hedges or trees, or use a fence as a barrier. For running bamboo, install barriers like sheet metal or concrete to prevent them from invading other parts of the yard. These barriers should be approximately 3 to 4 feet in depth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data.  But I can use this background: Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.  What is an answer for this question: Which researcher studied less about abrasion? The answer to this question is:","output":"Manny studied less about abrasion, as his research focused on environments that have never been glaciated. Danny, on the other hand, studied glaciated environments, where abrasion is a primary process of landscape change due to the movement of ice down a valley."},{"instruction":"Title: Your rosewood fretboard will love it Review: This stuff is great for keeping your rosewood fretboard looking like a million bucks.

He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird.

The JAA was an associated body of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), which aimed to facilitate cooperation among its member states to develop and implement common safety regulatory standards and procedures in civil aviation. The primary purpose of the JAA was to harmonize civil aviation regulations across European member states to create a safer, more efficient, and integrated European aviation system. Although the JAA was not a direct regulatory body itself, it achieved regulation through its member authorities who were responsible for civil aviation regulations within their respective nations. This collaborative approach allowed the JAA to work on various aspects of aviation safety, such as aircraft design and maintenance, flight operations, and air traffic management, sharing knowledge and expertise among member states in a mutually beneficial manner. The establishment of the JAA demonstrated an agreement among the participating European states to work together on a common platform, with the primary objective of enhancing the safety, efficiency, and overall performance of their civil aviation industries. By jointly developing and implementing safety regulations and procedures, these European states were able to share resources, knowledge, and experience, which would contribute to better understanding and management of potential risks and challenges in the field of civil aviation. In summary, it is accurate to conclude that a number of European States agreed to the formation of the Joint Aviation Authorities, as this body enabled them to collaborate and establish common safety regulatory standards and procedures in civil aviation, ultimately leading to a more integrated and safer European aviation system. However, it is important to note that the JAA has since been replaced by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which now serves as the central regulatory body for civil aviation within the European Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Understand the context of the text First, I made sure to understand that the text is discussing a gift that Angela and Erin received. Angela is more thankful for it, and the text is aiming to provide the reasons as to why that is the case. Step 2: Develop a reason for Angela's higher gratitude To continue the text, I needed to provide a valid reason as to why Angela has a higher level of gratitude for the gift than Erin does. So, I decided to mention that Angela had been longing for this gift and had been trying to communicate her desires subtly. Step 3: Add an element of intrigue To make the story more engaging and elicit more empathy for Angela's character, I described her unsuccessful attempts at informing others about her wishes, contributing to her increased appreciation for the gift.  Step 4: Review and ensure continuity In order to make certain that the response is consistent and follows the intended context, I verified if my continuation fits the storyline and provides a satisfactory answer while not deviating from the original intent. As a result, when Angela finally received the gift, her joy was indescribable. She couldn't help but wear the brightest smile on her face, her eyes sparkling with immense gratitude. In comparison, Erin was appreciative of the gift but, unlike Angela, it wasn't something she had been wishing for. It was more of a pleasant surprise for her, rather than an answer to her heartfelt desires.

Dipping them in milk would only disturb their exquisite composition, whereas the crisp, dense cookies would become pleasingly tender when soaked. As I continued my little teatime ritual, I couldn't help but think about the love and care that went into creating these delightful treats. The cookies were a handed-down family recipe, hard and crumbly, studded with sweet raisins and buttery pecans. They had been a steadfast standby of my childhood, whipped up for any special occasion or a late-night snack shared between family members. The cakes, on the other hand, were a new creation from a local bakery, born of a daring idea and the passion of a novice baker turned entrepreneur. The novel combination of flavors and textures captured the imagination of those in my town, and it soon became an object of fascination to behold and consume. Despite the differences in their origin stories and composition, both treats held a special place in my heart. The cookies and cakes embodied the values of tradition and innovation, two elements that had always motivated me to push my boundaries and explore new avenues of personal growth. With each nibble, I contemplated the story behind each dessert and the broader lessons I could take from them. I ruminated on the importance of preserving time-honored customs, like regularly gathering with family and friends to break bread. At the same time, I also cherished the ambitious spirit of risk-taking and progress that the cakes represented. Like the young baker who dared to make his mark on the world, I too yearned to leave my comfort zone and see how my own passions could transform not only my life, but also the lives of those around me. It was with these thoughts swirling in my mind that I began to notice a faint melody drifting through the air, the sweet notes of a piano beckoning me to pause and take in the moment. Feeling oddly inspired, I carefully set aside my plate, letting the tune guide me into the living room where the glistening keys of our grand piano awaited. With a reverent touch, I slowly pressed my fingers against the ivory, letting my intuition guide my actions. At first, the music I created was hesitant, just as I had been when contemplating the blend of tradition and innovation in the treats I enjoyed earlier. But as I continued to play, my confidence grew, and the notes began to find their own voice, becoming bolder and more assured. As I continued to play, I began to realize that, just like the treats on my plate, the melody that I was creating was a captivating blend of the familiar and the unexpected. I was finding a unique harmony in the moment as I allowed tradition and innovation to dance together in a tune that was all my own, and, as the music crescendoed, I realized that I had embraced the best of both worlds. The harmony of cookies and cakes, the interplay of family recipes and bold new ideas, had granted me insight into a critical truth—an understanding that honoring the past could gracefully coexist with embracing the future, that our foundation in tradition can nourish the seeds of our growth, and that we are all limited only by the breadth of our own dreams, creativity, and courage. As the last note of my impromptu recital hung in the air, I found myself uplifted by this newfound wisdom, and filled with a sense of gratitude for the cookies and cakes that had brought me to this moment of ephemeral clarity. For it is in these small, seemingly insignificant moments of sweetness that we can often find the most transformative and lasting inspiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife. Being a soft-core film, that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects. As plots go for this type of genre, not to bad. The script is okay, and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 AM watching this not to notice too many plot holes. But everything else in the film seems cheap. The lead actors aren't that bad, but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad (one girl seems like she is drunk and/or high). The cinematography is badly lit, with everything looking grainy and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying. The worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it-the sex. The reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in Red Shoe Diary situations. The sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy, shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it. The woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage.

In fact, the premise provides evidence that directly contradicts this hypothesis. From the premise, we can gather a number of pieces of information: 1. Dark rings have formed under the woman's eyes: This is an indicator that something may be wrong with the woman. Dark circles or rings under the eyes can be a sign of various issues, such as fatigue, stress, or illness, which may reasonably cause Jon concern. 2. The eyes themselves nearly sent Jon into a panic: This statement alone contradicts the hypothesis that Jon wasn't worried about her eyes. When something causes a person to nearly panic, it is an indication that the situation is causing a significant amount of distress or worry. If Jon's reaction was close to bordering on panic, it is safe to say that he was extremely worried about her eyes. 3. The overall tone of the premise suggests concern: When analyzing the statement as a whole, the language used suggests a tone of worry and alarm. Words like \\"dark rings,\\" \\"nearly sent,\\" and \\"panic\\" all evoke a sense of anxiety and concern on Jon's part, further disproving the hypothesis that Jon wasn't worried about her eyes.

Obtain a sufficient number of pins that can be placed into the ground or rock surfaces. Ensure the pins are durable, weather-resistant, and easily visible for tracking purposes. 3. Make sure you have the necessary tools and equipment to properly place the pins, such as hammers or drills, depending on the type of surface. 4. Carefully place the pins at the predetermined locations, making sure to record their position accurately. It is important to ensure that the pins do not cause any harm to the environment or disturb any local habitats. 5. Develop a system for monitoring and documenting any changes in the canyon. This could include regular visits to the pinned locations, recording measurements, or taking photographs to visually document any differences over time. 6. Periodically analyze the collected data to identify any trends or significant changes. This information can then be used to inform environmental conservation efforts, geological research, or safety measures within the canyon.

Options: - youngstock - aged - mature - old - senior  Explain why a human would choose \\"old\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"old\\" to answer the question above for several reasons. Firstly, the question seems to be inquiring about the age of the man being referred to, and the choices provided are all related to age. Therefore, in this context, \\"old\\" seems like the most fitting option. Here's a deeper analysis of each option and why \\"old\\" might be the most suitable choice for a human: 1. Youngstock: This term typically applies to young animals, particularly in the context of livestock. It does not accurately describe the age of a person and would not make sense in this context. 2. Aged: Although this term could technically be used to describe an older individual, it tends to have a more formal and less specific connotation. In this context, \\"old\\" is more concise and directly reflects the idea that the young lady might be particularly interested in the man's wealth and not concerned with his age. 3. Mature: This term generally implies an individual who is fully grown and has a developed sense of responsibility. Although it suggests that the person is not youthful, it does not provide a clear indication of their age. \\"Old\\" would be a better choice to emphasize the potential age difference and the fact that the young lady did not care about it. 4. Old: This term is straightforward and clearly indicates that the man in question is advanced in age. It matches the context of the question, and it reveals the young lady's priorities, which were centered on his wealth rather than his age. Choosing \\"old\\" paints a clearer picture of the situation and the young lady's motivations. 5. Senior: While this term does signify age as well, it can be somewhat ambiguous when applied to humans. It might refer to both elderly people and those holding higher or leadership positions, such as in a company or a family. In this case, \\"old\\" provides a clearer understanding of the man's specific age, which is the focus of the question. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"old\\" to answer the question above because it directly aligns with the context of the question and provides the most accurate description of the man's age. It also helps underline the young lady's indifference to his age, as her main concern was his wealth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: To get better at MMA, you'll need to become proficient in basic strikes and grappling techniques. The basic punches include hooks, jabs, straights, and uppercuts.  You'll also want to learn basic push and roundhouse kicks. In grappling, you'll want to learn the different positions and how to do basic moves like armbars, triangle chokes, and the rear naked choke. Practice mastering these basic techniques before advancing to more elaborate techniques. Going to class regularly will keep your skills sharp and can keep you in shape. Try not to take too much time off in between classes when you're starting off. Go to at least three classes per week and then pace yourself to see how many classes you feel comfortable going to each week. While being sore is natural, you don't want to overdo it. When you get physically fatigued, overly sore, or injured, take time off from training and let your body recover. If you don't let your body recover from training, you can become weaker and less focused. Fatigue, weakness, decreased performance, and constant muscle soreness are signs of overtraining. Sparring is the portion of your training when you get to test your technique on a fellow classmate. Don't be scared to exchange punches and kicks with your classmate. When sparring, go in with an end goal in mind, like scoring a flush roundhouse kick or working to improve your distance making with your jab.  Work on perfecting the basics on a moving target, and remember to pace yourself. The goal of sparring is to perfect your technique, not to hurt your opponent. It's good manners to shake your opponent's hand before and after sparring. Sparring partners will often try to match your intensity, so expect to get what you give. Rolling is when you practice your grappling techniques on a classmate without incorporating strikes. Grappling and wrestling can be grueling, and it takes a lot of endurance, so take your time and pace yourself. Practice getting out of tough situations, gaining superior positioning, and trying various submissions. Even though training and practicing technique is essential, it's also important that you work to improve your strength and endurance. Squats, deadlifts, and bench presses combined with regular sprinting, jump rope, and stretching will make you stronger, quicker, and more flexible. Designate one or two days a week in your training to work on your strength and conditioning along with your technique training. Make sure to check with the local governing body for fighting sports in your state before you sign up to compete so that you're aware of all rules and regulations. Typically when you're ready to fight, your gym or trainer will help you register for an organized competition. Talk to them and make a decision on which kind of competition or fight you want to compete in. Keep track of the things you're eating by writing down the different meals that you have throughout the day and counting your calorie and nutrient intake. You'll want to hydrate yourself and maintain a diet that's high in protein and carbohydrates. If you're training heavily, try to maintain a diet of 1 gram (0.035 oz) of carbs and protein per pound that you weigh. Your diet should also contain plenty of omega-3 fats and traditional vitamins and minerals. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To improve in MMA, focus on mastering basic striking and grappling techniques, such as punches, kicks, and submissions like armbars and chokes. Regularly attend classes, preferably at least three times a week, and allow your body to recover from intense training to avoid overtraining. Incorporate sparring and rolling sessions to practice techniques on live opponents while maintaining good sportsmanship. Alongside technique training, work on strength and endurance through exercises like squats, deadlifts, sprints, and jump rope, designating specific days for conditioning. Consult with your gym or trainer before signing up for competitions and ensure you're aware of the governing body's rules and regulations. Maintain a healthy, well-balanced diet with a focus on proteins, carbohydrates, omega-3 fats, vitamins, and minerals to support your training goals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was bad enough that America was at war, but the young Virginia girl was not used to battles being fought this close.  _ .Annie sat up in bed and listened.Had a stranger broken in? Earlier, the family had heard that captured officers recently escaped from a prison nearby.    Quietly opening her bedroom door, Annie walked out. A figure in a black gown was walking down the hall. It was Aunt Bet, carrying a candle in one hand and a plate of fried chicken in the other.    Annie followed her aunt to a stairway at the far end of the house. Aunt Bet climbed to the top, and opened a door leading to the attic . Annie followed closely behind.    In the attic, Aunt Bet stopped at a chest of drawers, moved it aside, and felt along the wall behind it. Slowly a door sprang open, revealing a hidden room. A thin man stepped out of the opening. As Aunt Bet handed him the plate of food, the young man saw Annie in the doorway and froze. Desperately shaking her head \\"no\\", the girl raised one finger to her lips. The officer understood and shifted his look. Quickly Annie went back downstairs and hid, waiting until after Aunt Bet left to return. Back inside the attic,Annie called softly to the man inside, who told her where to find the hidden spring.    Soon the young officer stood in the open doorway. A small candle burned on a table behind him and, in its soft light, Annie studied his face. Clear eyes reflected the calm of one who faced death bravely.    Smiling, he said,\\"What trouble you should have gotten into if your aunt had turned around!\\" That night, Annie learned Aunt Bet was one of many daring Southerners whose hatred  of slavery drove them to risk their lives by spying for the North.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

Write a text based on this summary: irish vote on budget eu says crisis pot is enough Text:","output":"Title: Irish Voters Approve Budget Amidst EU Assurances on Crisis Fund Adequacy The Irish citizens have recently cast their votes on the country's budget, showcasing their active participation in shaping the nation's economic future amidst a critical period marked by financial tensions within the Eurozone. This significant event has emerged in parallel with the European Union's latest assertion that the existing crisis funds would sufficiently support its member countries in overcoming any economic challenges they may face moving forward. Ireland has long struggled with various economic crises, especially in the aftermath of the 2008 global recession. With an immense sovereign debt burden and the nationalization of several banks, the nation faced considerable hurdles in its path to recovery. The Irish government has been working tirelessly to address these issues and restore the robust growth that characterized the Celtic Tiger era. The recently-held vote on the national budget is a crucial step in this process, as it allowed the citizens of Ireland to voice their opinions on the country's financial priorities and the best course of action to remediate the outstanding economic concerns. The outcome of this vote will not only impact Ireland's trajectory in the short term but will also shape its long-term prospects in the broader European context. Meanwhile, the European Union has stepped forward to assuage fears that a major financial crisis would leave member states with insufficient aid. It has reassured its member countries that the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a fund established to provide financial assistance to Eurozone countries in need, possesses ample resources to help any member state address and overcome its economic challenges. This message of confidence has served as an important source of optimism for countries like Ireland, which continue to grapple with the ramifications of past financial crises. Moreover, the EU's assertion reinforces its commitment to maintaining the stability of the Euro as the common currency. By ensuring that the ESM is adequately funded, the European Union seeks to reinforce the notion that it stands ready to protect and support the economic integrity of the Eurozone, even in times of significant financial turmoil. This, in turn, allows the member states to focus on finding ways to bolster their national economies, safe in the knowledge that the European Union remains a stable support network. In conclusion, the recent Irish vote on the nation's budget represents an important milestone in the nation's journey towards economic recovery, with greater public involvement and European Union assurances fostering a positive outlook for the future. The European Union's declaration that the ESM is sufficiently funded to tackle potential crises further strengthens the EU's role as a stabilizing force in times of financial uncertainty. As the Eurozone continues its path towards growth, the collaboration between individual member states, like Ireland, and the broader European community will be crucial in fostering sustained prosperity on a transnational level."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While facing disasters at the Eastern front, Mehmed III died on 20 December 1603 at the age of 37. The new sultan Ahmed I who was 13 years old appointed Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha as the commander of the eastern army who marched from Istanbul 15 June 1604, a very late time for the campaigning season. Until he reached the front on 8 November 1604, the Safavid army had already captured Yerevan in June and advanced towards Kars before being stopped in Akhaltsikhe. Seeing the late season as an excuse, he did not counter-attack Abbas I and decided to stay in Van until the end of the winter. However, the Safavid advance forced him to march towards Erzurum. The inactivity created unrest among the Turkish ranks. His campaign of 1605 was unsuccessful, the forces he led towards Tabriz suffering defeat near the shore of Lake Urmia on 9 September 1605. This was the first Safavid pitched victory against the Ottomans in their history. In this battle Abbas I utilized his predominantly cavalry force to great advantage, decisively defeating the Ottomans, who suffered some 20,000 dead. Kose Sefer Pasha, Beylerbey of Erzurum, acted independently and was captured by Safavid forces. Cağaloğlu had to withdraw to the fortress of Van and thence in the direction of Diyarbakır. He ordered the execution of Canbulatoğlu Hüseyin Pasha claiming he was late to reinforce the Ottoman army which caused a larger unrest. Sinan  died in the course of this retreat in December 1605 and Abbas I was able to liberate Ganja, Baku, Shirvan and Shamakhi in Azerbaijan in June 1606.

Given the question: Given the background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.  and the situation: Pam and Ellie are two entomologists. they are both studying ants at the moment: Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids.  Answer the following question: Which scientist read less about dairying ants milking the aphids? The answer is:","output":"Ellie read less about dairying ants milking the aphids.  Both Pam and Ellie are entomologists studying ants; however, their focus is on different types of ants. Pam is specifically studying ants that farm aphids, which involves the mutualistic relationship between aphids and ants, including the milking behavior. This means that Pam would need to extensively research and observe the interactions between ants and aphids, including how dairying ants milk aphids for honeydew. On the other hand, Ellie is focusing on leafcutter ants. Leafcutter ants do not farm aphids nor engage in the mutualistic relationship involving milking aphids. Instead, leafcutter ants are known for their fungus-farming behavior, where they collect plant material and use it to cultivate a symbiotic fungus as a food source. Therefore, Ellie's research would likely focus more on the behaviors related to leaf cutting, fungus cultivation, and the complex social structure within leafcutter ant colonies, rather than the interactions between ants and aphids. As a result, it can be concluded that Ellie, who is studying leafcutter ants, read less about dairying ants milking the aphids compared to Pam, who is specifically studying ants that farm aphids."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Breistroff, a Harvard graduate, was a professional hockey player with a promising career. Snow worked for a hedge fund in New York City. On July 17, 1996, their lives changed forever. Breistroff boarded TWA Flight 800 bound for his native France on his way to Germany to play professional hockey. \\"He called me, and he told me he was getting on the plane. And he asked me to marry him on the phone before he got on the plane,\\" Snow told CNN the next day. Twelve minutes after takeoff from JFK Airport, the plane exploded in midair off the coast of Long Island. Two hundred thirty passengers were on board. No one survived. \\"After we said our final 'I love yous' ... about two hours later, my mom called,\\" Snow recalled recently. \\"She said, 'Please tell me that Michel didn't go to Paris tonight.'\\" Snow immediately turned on the TV. \\"I just remember fire and really dark water. And at that point, my life stood still,\\" she said. \\"He was strong, he was young, and he definitely swam to shore. And I held on to that hope. And then the next morning it became a recovery mission.\\" About five weeks later, Snow's greatest fear was confirmed when Breistroff's remains were recovered from the bottom of the ocean. \\"One of the hardest things for me was just going home,\\" she said. \\"Everybody is resuming life as normal but I had a huge hole in my heart, and I had a future planned with somebody and that was gone.\\" Snow looked for a support group in New York City but couldn't find one. She spoke with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and he suggested she attend a meeting with families from Pan Am Flight 103, which had exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, eight years earlier. \\"When I walked in the room, it was the first time I didn't have to apologize for my tears. They didn't have to say a word. They got it,\\" she said. Snow met a woman who lost her fiancé on the Pan Am flight. \\"She would meet with me and talk with me,\\" Snow said. \\"She is really how I got through it.\\" From there, Snow began pairing up mothers to mothers, siblings to siblings, spouses to spouses -- Pan Am families with TWA families. A few months later, ACCESS was born. ACCESS, short for AirCraft Casualty Emotional Support Services, is a nonprofit bereavement support program for people who have lost loved ones in aviation disasters. \\"We have 250 grief mentors from air disasters dating back to 1958 -- private, military and commercial air disasters,\\" Snow said. \\"This gives people an opportunity to share what they went through with somebody else and also provide hope for them.\\" Most of the trained grief mentors have called in for help in the past, Snow said. Rachel Courtney is one of them. Courtney lost her father, James Courtney, along with his legal assistant in a private plane crash in 1998. \\"For a period of three weeks, we were searching for him in the woods,\\" Courtney said. \\"The first night I was home, we were all in a small airport...I thought he's probably cold and in the woods and that nobody's helping him. And I was completely panicked.\\" A year later, Courtney was still grappling with the loss. \\"I realized that the world was moving on but in a lot of respects, I wasn't,\\" she said. \\"Heidi ended up pairing me up with another woman who was a mentor, who had lost her father in an aircraft disaster.\\" Courtney's experience inspired her to help others. \\"To me, it was 'I got through this,'\\" she said. \\"I wanted to be there to help other people see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.\\" When planes go down, like AirAsia Flight 8501, which left 162 people dead in December, Snow and her team of grief mentors stand by ready to help. \\"Every time we have the opportunity to speak about ACCESS on the news...We get calls for help from people who have lost loved ones who didn't know we were there,\\" she said. Snow appeared on several CNN shows after the AirAsia crash. \\"Every time these incidents occur we are walking with them, we remember, we are grieving with them,\\" Snow told Michaela Pereira on CNN's \\"New Day.\\" In addition to providing one-on-one support, the organization shares information with airlines and organizations to help them offer more effective emotional support after these types of losses. Snow also wrote the book \\"Surviving Sudden Loss: Stories from those who have lived it\\" as another tool families could use to deal with their grief. \\"This is a lifelong journey. ...

Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday. The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash. The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people. The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt. Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday.

But people who decide to \\"go organic\\" could soon find themselves piling on the pounds. The warning comes from American researchers who studied whether the sight of an organic label was enough to influence a person's choice. For example, if people believe organic foods, produced without using pesticides   and artificial fertilizers  , have fewer calories, they may end up eating far too much and spending less time on sports activities and put on weight. Cornell University researchers said: \\" Some people mistakenly think that these foods are more nutritious  , just because they carry an organic label.\\" \\"The growing popularity of organic foods has led to some concern, as these foods may not necessarily be healthier than non-organic ones, but still may lead consumers to nutritional mis-judgments. If people feel a food to be more nutritious, they tend to let their guard down when it comes to counting calories---in the end leading them to overeat.\\" Although a small number of differences in nutrient content were found to exist between organically-produced crops and traditionally-produced ones, these are of little health importance.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Frenzied, over-the-top 'A-Team' gives B-movies a bad name By Claudia Puig, USA TODAY As the leader of the A-Team, boldly asserts: \\"Overkill is underrated.\\" Though it's a clever line, it's hardly a viable mantra for a coherent action flick — even one based on a shlocky '80s TV show. Director Joe Carnahan ascribes to the wrongheaded notion that frantic equals exciting. But there's nothing exciting about this awful, over-the-top reboot. There is, however, plenty of frenetic action of the sort that's delivered so speedily that instead of quickening our pulses, it makes our eyes glaze. Despite a talented cast, this nearly two-hour inane frenzy of action and violence is rarely more than bloated and boring. The A-Team 2.0 consist of Bradley Cooper as the womanizing Templeton \\"Face\\" Peck, District 9's Sharlto Copley as the borderline insane \\"Howlin' Mad\\" Murdock and Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Johnson as the nimble fighter B.A. Baracus, made famous by Mr. T. The three are led by Neeson, who plays Hannibal Smith. Why Neeson has decided to reinvent himself as an action hero is mystifying. But then, it's also bewildering why a studio chose to remake this forgettable TV show. The team is supposedly an ultra-courageous, elite military squad who carries out inventive and daring escapades. Their antics also are played for silly comic effect. But neither the comedy nor the stunts and effects make for much fun. Baracus is a fierce fighter, but he's a remarkable baby when it comes to flying. He's alternately drugged and enticed with food to get him on board a helicopter flown by the nutso Murdock. This is Carnahan and company's idea of humor. The film opens abruptly when the quartet — Iraq War vets this time around — takes a top-secret assignment which results in their being framed. They're all thrown into prison, hellbent on proving their innocence. An unconvincing romance between Cooper's Face and Jessica Biel's Capt. Sosa is shoehorned in. The much-used technique of cutting back and forth among characters devising and executing elaborate plans wears thin. There is one outlandish scene where the team flies a tank through the air. Never mind credibility — at least it's an original visual effect in a movie that is thoroughly derivative. Subverting a quote from Gandhi to justify violence may be stretching the notion of originality. But if the rest of the movie had been cheeky enough, that would have been a much funnier line. Instead, we get wooden acting and over-the-top action. It's hard not to pity the fools who spend their dollars on this overblown mess.

Answer this question: how are cholera and typhus transmitted and prevented?","output":"Cholera and typhus are both infectious diseases caused by bacteria, but they are transmitted through different means and have distinct prevention strategies. 1. Cholera transmission: Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is primarily transmitted through the consumption of contaminated water or food. Ingestion of water or food contaminated with fecal matter containing the bacterium is the main route of transmission. In some cases, it can also be transmitted through eating raw or undercooked shellfish that come from contaminated water sources. Cholera prevention: To prevent cholera, the following measures can be taken: - Drink only safe water: Boil water or treat with a reliable disinfectant before drinking. Bottled or packaged water is safer if seals are intact. - Cook food thoroughly: Ensure that food is cooked and served hot, especially seafood.  - Wash fruits and vegetables: Thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables with safe water before consumption. - Maintain good hygiene: Regularly wash hands with soap and clean water, especially before preparing or consuming food, after using the toilet, and after contact with contaminated surfaces. - Proper sanitation: Dispose of sewage and fecal matter safely to reduce the risk of water contamination. - Cholera vaccines: In high-risk areas, cholera vaccines may be administered for additional protection. 2. Typhus transmission: Typhus is caused by bacteria belonging to the Rickettsia family. There are several types of typhus, but the most common form is epidemic typhus, which is transmitted through infected body lice. When a person comes into contact with the feces or crushed body of an infected louse, the bacteria can enter the body through scratches or mucous membranes. Other forms, like murine typhus, are transmitted through infected fleas or ticks. Typhus prevention: To prevent typhus, the following steps can be taken: - Maintain personal hygiene: Regularly wash your body, clothes, and bedding to reduce the risk of lice infestation. - Avoid contact with potential carriers: Stay away from rodents or areas with a high population of rats, mice, or fleas. - Use insect repellent: Apply insect repellents containing DEET to your skin and clothing to repel lice, fleas, and ticks. - Wear protective clothing: In high-risk areas, wear long sleeves, pants, and socks to minimize skin exposure to potential carriers, and tuck pants into socks to deter ticks. - Check for and remove ticks: Examine your body and clothes after outdoor activities in endemic areas, and carefully remove any ticks found. - Pest control: Implement pest control measures to reduce the population of rodents and other vermin around your home and community. In general, maintaining good hygiene and sanitation and protecting yourself from insect vectors are key in preventing both cholera and typhus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Apollo 11, carrying Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins, was launched on 16 July, 1969. Five days later they stepped down onto the moon. Neil Armstrong On the way there: Of all the wonderful views we had, the most impressive to me was on the way to the Moon when we flew through its shadow. We were still thousands of miles away, but close enough so that the Moon almost filled our window. The moon appeared blue-grey. It seemed almost as if it were showing us its roundness, its similarity in shape to our Earth, in a sort of welcome. I was sure it would be a hospitable  host. It had been waiting for its first visitors for a long time. After touch down: The sky is black, you know. It's a very dark sky, but it still seemed more like daylight than darkness as we looked out the window. It's a very strange thing but the surface looked very warm and inviting. It seemed to be tan . It's hard to explain that, because later when I held the material in my hand, it wasn't tan at all. It was black, grey and so on. Edwin Aldrin On the Moon: The blue color of my boots has completely disappeared now into this soil--still don't know what color to describe this other than grayish  cocoa.

In a petri dish, marked Cell X, Gary sees that substances inside the cell are spreading apart from each other making it less concentrated. In the dish marked Cell Y, Gary sees substances coming together and moving into close proximity to one another.  Is cell Y moving up or down the concentration gradient?  Hint: Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. The answer to this question is:","output":"Cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The Pentagon is leaking more than it had in the early '90s. Step 2: Analyze the premise The premise states that George Joulwan, as the NATO military commander, called for the Pentagon to stop leaking information during his tenure in the early '90s. This indicates that there were some leaks during that time, but it does not provide any comparison with other time periods. Step 3: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that the Pentagon is currently leaking more information than it did in the early '90s, i.e., it claims that there has been an increase in the leakage over time.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Break down the command into individual actions based on keywords:    - turn left (before): I_TURN_LEFT    - (twice) run around left (after): I_RUN around left, repeated twice 4. To run around left, the agent must:    - Take a left turn while running: I_TURN_LEFT    - Run: I_RUN    - Take another left turn: I_TURN_LEFT    - Run again to complete the around action: I_RUN 5. Since the command is to be executed twice, repeat the actions in step 4:    - I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN (first repetition)    - I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN (second repetition) 6.

She came to mind when I reflected on the audience's reaction to \\"The Mother.\\"  People gasped when May (Anne Reid) writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by May. I doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex. Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi (\\"My Beautiful Laundrette,\\" \\"My Son the Fanatic\\") again proves why he's among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the Atlantic. His story's not easy to take. This searing family drama isn't a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it's raw, complex, and often makes us very uncomfortable. Nevertheless, it's powerfully good stuff. Kureishi and Roger Michell (who directed \\"Notting Hill,\\" of all things) craft an unsentimental, wrenching and superbly-acted portrait of an older woman who realizes, after all these years, she can and should still enjoy all of life's pleasures. In a wonderfully epiphanous moment, when her son, Bobby, asks her not to be difficult, May shoots back, \\"Why not?\\" Why not, indeed. Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn as May. It's subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. Watch Reid when May observes Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub. Or, when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous date. Reid's eyes and face reveal all of May's anguish and despair. In the film's most devastating moment, May drops to her knees before Darren, willing to do anything for him, only asking him to be kind. This is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress. I enjoyed Michell's use of natural sound, especially when May and Toots first arrive at Bobby's place. It perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots, the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them. This film, at times, reminded me of the honesty and rawness of Mike Leigh's work, except \\"The Mother\\" hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat. My one quibble: Michell's decision to give May and Darren's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility. The lovers remain out of focus while, in the foreground, a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze. And the only sound is of May in the throes of passion. The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely envelops the role of Darren, plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it's unfair to hide their characters' almost primitive energy from the audience. Especially since Michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral. This film doesn't have immensely likable characters. We sympathize with May, but she, too, causes her daughter's suffering. But I doubt Kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk. His point, I believe, was to unmask a family that's already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens. It's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable.

Information:  - The Volkswagen Beetle (officially the Volkswagen Type 1, informally in Germany the Volkswagen Käfer, in Poland the Volkswagen Garbus and in the U.S. the Volkswagen Bug) is a two-door, four passenger, rear-engine economy car manufactured and marketed by German automaker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003.  - The Love Bug (sometimes referred to as Herbie the Love Bug) is a 1968 American comedy film and the first in a series of films made by Walt Disney Productions that starred an anthropomorphic pearl-white, fabric-sunroofed 1963 Volkswagen racing Beetle named Herbie. It was based on the 1961 book \\"Car, Boy, Girl\\" by Gordon Buford.  - Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing or automobile racing) is a sport involving the racing of automobiles for competition.   - In sport, racing is a competition of speed, against an objective criterion, usually a clock or to a specific point. The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal.  - An economy car is an automobile that is designed for low cost purchase and operation. Typical economy cars are small (compact or subcompact), lightweight, and inexpensive to buy. Economy car designers are forced by stringent design constraints to be inventive. Many innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model T and the Austin Mini. Gordon Murray, the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car: \\"I would say that building a car to sell for six thousand pounds and designing that for a high volume production, where you have all the quality issues under control is a hundred times more difficult than designing a Mclaren F1, or even a racing car. It is certainly the biggest challenge I've ever had from a design point of view.\\" The alternative approach other than innovating to build a low cost car, is build a stripped down no frills version of a conventional car.  - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.  - Herbie the Love Bug is an anthropomorphic 1963 Volkswagen Beetle , a character that is featured in several Disney motion pictures starting with the 1968 feature film The Love Bug . He has a mind of his own and is capable of driving himself , and is also a serious contender in auto racing competitions . Throughout most of the franchise , Herbie is distinguished by red , white and blue racing stripes from front to back bumper , a racing - style number \`\` 53 '' on the front luggage compartment lid , doors , and engine lid , and a yellow - on - black ' 63 California license plate with the lettering \`\` OFP 857 '' .  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound.

Both sentences mention that Thomas Fothergill was associated with the University of Oxford and held an administrative position. Let us break down the similarities and differences between the two sentences: 1. Both sentences indicate that Thomas Fothergill was an administrator at the University of Oxford. In the first sentence, this is shown by the phrase \\"English academic administrator,\\" while the second sentence uses \\"academic English administrator.\\" Note that in the second sentence, the word \\"English\\" is being used to emphasize the nationality of Thomas Fothergill or the nature of the university instead of describing the position. 2. Both sentences specify that Thomas Fothergill was associated with the University of Oxford. 3. The first sentence does not mention any specific degree or honor held by Thomas Fothergill. The second sentence, however, adds the abbreviation \\"D.D.\\" after his name, which stands for Doctor of Divinity, a degree in theology. This detail highlights Thomas Fothergill's educational background and lends an air of authority to his profession. 4. The order of the words in both sentences is different, but the meaning remains consistent. The first sentence begins with the subject (Thomas Fothergill) and proceeds to describe his profession and affiliation, while the second sentence starts with the subject and his degree, followed by a brief description of his profession. In conclusion, both sentences essentially convey the same meaning about Thomas Fothergill's profession and his association with the University of Oxford. The variations in word order and the mention of the \\"D.D.\\" degree in the second sentence add a touch of difference but do not deviate from the core information being communicated.

Question: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

Summarize this article: Diverse Images/UIG/Getty Images      A hallucinogenic drug derived from magic mushrooms could be useful in treating depression, the first safety study of this approach has concluded.      Researchers from Imperial College London gave 12 people psilocybin, the active component in magic mushrooms. All had been clinically depressed for a significant amount of time — on average 17.8 years. None of the patients had responded to standard medications, such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or had electroconvulsive therapy.      One week after receiving an oral dose of psilocybin, all patients experienced a marked improvement in their symptoms. Three months on, five patients were in complete remission.      “That is pretty remarkable in the context of currently available treatments,” says Robin Carhart-Harris, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College London and first author of the latest study, which is published in The Lancet Psychiatry1.      The equivalent remission rate for SSRIs is around 20%.      The study's authors are not suggesting that psilocybin should be a treatment of last resort for depressed patients. “Our conclusion is more sober than that — we are simply saying that this is doable,” says Carhart-Harris. “We can give psilocybin to depressed patients, they can tolerate it, and it is safe. This gives us an initial impression of the effectiveness of the treatment.”      Drug problems      Demonstrating the safety of psilocybin is no small task. Magic mushrooms are categorized as a Class A illegal drug in the United Kingdom — the most serious category, which also includes heroin and cocaine.      The ethics committee that granted approval for the trial was so concerned that trial volunteers could experience delayed onset psychotic symptoms that it requested a three-month follow-up on the subjects.      “The study result isn’t the remarkable part — it’s the fact that we did it at all.”      “This was unprecedented,” says neuropsychopharmacologist David Nutt at Imperial, who is senior author of the study.      It took 32 months between having the grant awarded and dosing the first patient, says Nutt. By comparison, it took six months “to get through the machinations” for his team’s previous studies using the equally illegal drugs LSD and MDMA, he says.      “Every interaction — applying for licenses, waiting for licenses, receiving the licenses, applying for contracts for drug manufacture, on and on — involved a delay of up to two months. It was enormously frustrating, and most of it was unnecessary,” says Nutt. “The study result isn’t the remarkable part — it’s the fact that we did it at all.”      Scientists at the Heffter Research Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico, have been investigating how psilocybin could be used to alleviate depression and anxiety in people with terminal cancer, but this is the first study to look specifically at how psilocybin could be used to treat depression alone.      The World Health Organisation calls depression “the leading cause of disability worldwide”. But effective therapies are hard to find. Searching for new treatments, researchers have looked to potent and quirky alternatives such as ketamine and ayahuasca, both of which have shown promise in clinical trials.      “It’s worth noting that we have not developed any new treatments which are widely used since the 1970s for depression, despite the fact that this is the major public-health problem in the Western world and middle-income countries,” says Glyn Lewis, who studies psychiatric disorders at University College London.      Particularly interesting, he says, is the fact that psilocybin seems to take effect with a single dose, unlike some current medications for depression that must be taken daily.      “This study is simply asking: is this interesting enough to pursue further as a treatment for depression?” says Lewis. “My own judgement is that yes, it is.” ||||| A small scale study into treating depression using psilocybin, the psychedelic compound of magic mushrooms, has found it can be safely administered.      The study team, from Imperial College London, say this could pave the way for future randomised-controlled trials to establish the efficacy of the compound in treating this form of depression.      Psychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place, such as careful screening and professional therapeutic support. – Dr Robin Carhart-Harris Study author      It is estimated that 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. The annual cost of depression in England is thought to be around £7.5 billion. Most people with depression respond positively to treatment using antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy. But around 20 per cent of those with depression do not respond to treatments and are classified as having treatment-resistant depression.      Previous studies have looked into the potential of using psychedelic drugs for conditions such as end of life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and smoking dependence. Psilocybin acts on the serotonin system suggesting it could be developed for use in the treatment of depression.      The study, funded by the Medical Research Council, aimed to assess safety and whether a potential treatment dose of psilocybin could be tolerated.      Hallucinogenics such as psilocybin can cause unpleasant reactions, including anxiety and paranoia, so it is important to establish whether the drug can be administered safely to people with depression. To investigate the safety and feasibility of using psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression, researchers from Imperial conducted a strictly monitored feasibility study. As this was not a randomised-controlled trial, the patients knew they were receiving the drug and there was no control group to provide comparison either with existing treatments or with no treatment at all.      Twelve people with moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression who had not responded to at least two courses of antidepressants were recruited (six men and six women, aged 30 to 64). Most of the participants actively volunteered to take part following presentations by the researchers and media coverage.      Eleven of the participants had previously undergone psychotherapy. The volunteers went through a thorough screening process before they were allowed to participate. Criteria used to rule out participants from taking part included people with a history of suicide attempts, those with diagnosis of a psychotic disorder and other significant medical conditions. Participants were fully supported at all times before, during and after they received psilocybin.      The patients received Home Office-approved psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions seven days apart.      The psilocybin was administered to the participants at a research facility and participants were monitored by at least two members of clinical staff at all times during the psilocybin administration sessions. There was a follow-up with patients the next day, and then one, two, three and five weeks after the second dosing session.      Blood pressure, heart rate and the self-reported intensity of the effects of psilocybin were monitored before and continuously during each dosing session. No serious unexpected side effects were reported during the study. All participants reported temporary anxiety before and during initial drug administration.      All patients showed some decrease in symptoms of depression for at least three weeks. Seven of them continued to show a positive response three months after the treatment, with five remaining in remission after three months.      There are some limitations to this study, in addition to the small sample size. Previous studies have shown that using psychedelics can leave one open to suggestion, which could have been part of the positive outcomes seen here. It was also not possible to control for the psychological support received throughout this study.      Lead author, Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, said: “Psychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place, such as careful screening and professional therapeutic support. I wouldn't want members of the public thinking they can treat their own depressions by picking their own magic mushrooms. That kind of approach could be risky.”      Senior author Professor David Nutt, the Edmond J Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial, said: “It is important that academic research groups try to develop possible new treatments for depression as the pharmaceutical industry is pulling out of this field. Our study has shown psilocybin is safe and fast acting so may, if administered carefully, have value for these patients.”      Dr Louise Jones, head of translational research at the MRC, said: “We currently don’t have effective treatments for some people’s depression so we need to know more about how drugs such as psilocybin could be used for patient benefit. This study showed that, with appropriate safeguards, psilocybin can be safely administered to some patients with treatment-resistant depression. It will now be important to undertake studies that evaluate its role as a potential treatment.”      The study was published in The Lancet Psychiatry.      See the press release of this article ||||| Summary:","output":"The safety study from Imperial College London suggests that psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in magic mushrooms, could potentially be effective in treating depression. This conclusion comes as a result of research conducted on 12 individuals who had been suffering from treatment-resistant depression for an average of 17.8 years, and had not found relief from standard treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or electroconvulsive therapy. One week after receiving a single oral dose of psilocybin, all patients saw significant improvements in their symptoms. After three months, five of the patients were in complete remission from their depression, marking a substantial increase from the typical 20% remission rate seen with SSRIs. However, the authors clarify that they are not suggesting psilocybin as a definitive substitute or last resort treatment for depression. Instead, their study demonstrates that it is feasible and safe to give psilocybin to depressed patients who can tolerate it, setting the ground for additional and larger scale research to investigate the potency of the compound in treating depression. It should be noted that while the effectiveness and speed of psilocybin's impact on depression is significant, the substance is still considered a Class A illegal drug in the United Kingdom alongside substances like heroin and cocaine.  This research faced many logistical and ethical hurdles due to the drug's status. It took 32 months for the research team to be granted permission and to administer the first dose to a patient. Special precautions were made to ensure the trial's safety due to concerns about the potential for delayed onset psychotic symptoms in volunteers.  This research builds upon similar endeavours. For instance, scientists at the Heffter Research Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico have been investigating how psilocybin could potentially alleviate depression and anxiety in terminally ill cancer patients. However, this is the first study to evaluate the use of psilocybin in treating depression independently. Finally, the team emphasized the importance of having controlled, academic research environments for the administration of drugs like psilocybin given their potent psychological effects and the potential risks associated with misuse. Research into alternative treatment methods for depression is vital given its status as the “leading cause of disability worldwide,” according to the World Health Organisation, and considering that not all patients respond positively to currently available therapies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: why was ling released uncharged after going to jail? Movie title: Koma Movie plot: The movie begins with a young woman, who attended a wedding party held in a hotel and became drunk, waking up in one of the hotel rooms; only to realize in horror that her kidney has been surgically removed. Socialite Ching (Angelica Lee), who also attended the party, identified Ling (Karena Lam) as the prime suspect because she found out that Ling was the only stranger presented in the ball room. She is unknown to everyone in the party, even to the hotel staff. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed. Ling was released uncharged due to insufficient evidence as police believed Ching could be framing her for cheating with her boyfriend. Rather than quickly disappear, Ling starts stalking Ching, apparently jealous that Ching could have everything Ling wanted without an effort while Ling has to fight for it. Ching, at the beginning, sees that as a form of harassment, but soon twists it around and follows Ling instead. Ling seems accepting of this, showing her the darker side of life living as a poor girl compared to Ching's rich-girl background. The two engage in a subtle cat-and-mouse game, and Ching begins to fear for her life when Ling starts making threats to remove her kidney too. One night, Ching is kidnapped by a mysterious man that seems to be an ally of Ling's. Here, Ching reveals that her kidney is weak, and the man will not be able to sell it for much. She passes out, and wakes to find Ling injured beside her. Ching takes her to the hospital, and it isn't long before Ching finds out that Ling is actually a kind person, more true then the friendships Ching shares with her superficial socialite friends. She learns that Ling has a childhood sweetheart, whose identity she does not reveal. Ching and Ling then make a deal with the mysterious man so that Ching can get a kidney.

He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs.

Context: In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

During the Hundred Days he was appointed cavalry commander in Belgium, under the still resentful eye of Wellington. He fought at the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815 and at the Battle of Waterloo two days later, when he led the spectacular charge of the British heavy cavalry against Comte d'Erlon's column which checked and in part routed the French Army.  One of the last cannon shots fired that day hit Paget in the right leg, necessitating its amputation. According to anecdote, he was close to Wellington when his leg was hit, and exclaimed, \\"By God, sir, I've lost my leg!\\" -- to which Wellington replied, \\"By God, sir, so you have!\\" According to his aide-de-camp, Thomas Wildman, during the amputation Paget smiled and said, \\"I have had a pretty long run. I have been a beau these 47 years and it would not be fair to cut the young men out any longer.\\" While Paget had an articulated artificial limb fitted, his amputated leg meanwhile had a somewhat macabre after-life as a tourist attraction in the village of Waterloo in Belgium, to which it had been removed and where it was later interred.  Paget was created Marquess of Anglesey on 4 July 1815. A 27-metre (89 ft) high monument to his heroism (designed by Thomas Harrison) was erected at Llanfairpwllgwyngyll on Anglesey, close to Paget's country retreat at Plas Newydd, in 1816.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \\"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be...
