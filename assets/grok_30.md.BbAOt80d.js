Different places have specific rules and restrictions, and it's important to adhere to them. Step 2: Choose an appropriate container Select a suitable, sealable container, preferably one that is specifically designed to store gasoline. Metal or thick HDPE (high-density polyethylene) plastic containers that are both fuel-approved and labeled appropriately are recommended. Never use containers that have previously held chemicals, food, or drinks. Step 3: Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) Before handling gasoline, put on suitable personal protective equipment including gloves, safety goggles, and a long-sleeve shirt to protect your skin and eyes from any accidental splashes. Step 4: Transfer the gasoline to the container Carefully pour the gasoline into the approved container, using a funnel if necessary to avoid spills. Fill the container only to about 95% capacity, as gasoline may expand and contract due to temperature changes. Step 5: Secure the container Once the gasoline has been transferred, close the container with a tight-fitting cap to prevent leaks or spills. Never carry gasoline in an open or unsecured container. Step 6: Store the container temporarily Store the gasoline container in a well-ventilated area, away from sources of heat, ignition, or direct sunlight. Do not store it in a vehicle or living space. Step 7: Transport the gasoline to the disposal site Take the sealed container in an appropriate vehicle to your local hazardous waste disposal site. Avoid transporting it in a car with passengers, and ensure the car is well-ventilated to minimize risk. Step 8: Safely dispose of the gasoline Upon reaching the disposal site, follow their guidelines and instructions carefully for proper gasoline disposal. If the gasoline is clean and reusable, they may have a procedure to recycle or repurpose it. If the gasoline is contaminated or no longer usable, the facility will dispose of it in a safe and environmentally responsible manner."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The \`\` Cobblers '' dropped to 20th in 1991 -- 92 , before plummeting to 16th place in 1992 -- 93 under Phil Chard .","output":"No, these two sentences from Wikipedia do not have the same meaning. From a glance, they may seem to convey a similar message because both cover the progressive fall of The 'Cobblers' in two consecutive seasons, but the details within depict two different scenarios. In the first sentence, it says \\"The 'Cobblers' fell to 16th in 1991-92, before they dropped to 20th place in 1992--93 under Phil Chard.\\" This sentence tells us that in the 1991-92 season, The 'Cobblers' were in the 16th position, which is generally a higher ranking or better performance in most league systems. However, the following season, 1992-93, under Phil Chard, the team's performance worsened and they fell to the 20th position. On the other hand, the second sentence states \\"The 'Cobblers' dropped to 20th in 1991 -- 92, before plummeting to 16th place in 1992 -- 93 under Phil Chard.\\" Here, the initial standing of The 'Cobblers' in the 1991-92 season is lower than in the first sentence, at the 20th spot. The following season, 1992-93, they actually improved their ranking to the 16th position under Phil Chard.  To summarize, the exact placement and direction (fall versus rise) of The 'Cobblers' in those two successive seasons differ between the two sentences. Thus, while both sentences communicate a change in The 'Cobblers' standing over time, they depict contrasting trajectories in terms of improvement or decline."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Do not put a lot of lights in your haunted house, or people will be too relaxed. They will also be able to tell where your spooky friends are hiding. If it's dark, they will be tense and have a better time. Just make sure your guests have enough light to get through the house safely. Here are some ways to use the lighting to create a haunted effect:  Consider putting your guests in a very dark room and giving them flashlights to try to find the way out. Replace your lamps with dim, green bulbs around the house. Drape traditional lamps with cobwebs and tape rubber bats to the insides. Light a spotlight under a spider web or fake creepy insect to create a spooky shadow. Try mirrors, black lights, and smoke to confuse the visitors. The special effects will make your visitors feel more shocked and spooked at every turn. Fog machines and strobe lights are also classics when it comes to haunted house special effects.  You can find fog machines for around 30 at a party or Halloween store. Put strobe lights in a room to create a dramatic effect. The sounds in the haunted house will scare your visitors and keep them on their toes. The trick to having spooky noises is to time them perfectly and not use them too often, or your guests won't be surprised. Here are some tricks to creating some scary sounds:  Have a recording of a different spooky sound in every room. One room can have the sound of a chainsaw, while another can have the sound of a woman screaming. Your volunteers can scamper from one side of an empty room to another to create a scary sound. Put on a soundtrack made up of soft, creepy music. Use silence to your advantage. Pick some key moments to keep the house silent so your guests will be even more startled by the next sound. A maze is a great way to guide your guests through your haunted house, whether it is located in a house, apartment, or even a garage. You could stack boxes and cover them with a black cloth so they look like walls. Plan your maze out with a sketch first and then start building it at least a week before the haunted house. Decorate your maze with scary props, lights, and characters. Make sure the way out of the maze is clear to guests. If you are going for a fun, child-friendly theme, avoid gore and try to keep the decorations fun or only mildly scary. For example, use bats, friendly looking ghosts, or cartoonish looking monsters. Use decorations such as fake blood, skulls, hazmat suits, heads in a jar, or gory “bodies” if you want a more adult, scary theme. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To create an effective haunted house, it is important to use the right lighting, sounds, and decorations to maintain a spooky atmosphere and scare visitors. Keep the rooms dark with dim or colored lights, provide flashlights if necessary, and use special effects like fog machines and strobe lights. Incorporate scary soundtracks or noises, but avoid using them too often. Design a maze with scary props, lights, and characters to guide guests, and decorate according to the desired theme, whether it's child-friendly or adult-oriented with gore and intense scares."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: \\"History teaches us that men behave wisely . . . once they've exhausted all other alternatives. For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano, working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate. They arrange a meeting, where Karen informs them that she's tracked Brian and found his music royalties are being distributed per a bequest in his will, provoking Beano to compassionately ask if that means \\"the silly sod's dead?\\" The band again soldiers on.

Everest it would mean they are,\\" in relation to the provided options, implies you're discussing elevation or altitude. Here, getting 'high' at Mt. Everest means reaching a significant altitude on the mountain, or even climbing to the very top. Therefore, among the given options, the expression would most closely correspond with the option \\"[+] at the apex.\\" The term 'apex', in a geographical or topographical context, refers to the highest point or summit of a physical feature such as a mountain. Thus, when you're talking about getting 'high' on Mt. Everest, the world's highest peak with an altitude of about 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 feet) above sea level, you're referring to reaching substantial altitudes that would put climbers close to or at the top of it. So, if a person 'gets high' on Mount Everest, it implies that they have ascended to a great altitude or potentially even reached the apex, the topmost point of Mt. Everest. This is a considerable accomplishment considering the physically and mentally demanding nature of such climbs. This feat requires excellent physical fitness, mountaineering skills, acclimatization to high altitude conditions, and careful planning and preparation. The given options \\"[+] arriving at airport,\\" \\"[+] waiting for cabs,\\" and \\"[+] at the bottom,\\" don't fit in this context because they have little or no relation to someone getting 'high' regarding altitude on Mount Everest. The airport and cab options involve travel logistics and are not relevant to the physical act of ascending the mountain. The 'at the bottom' option contradicts the idea of getting 'high' in altitude because the bottom would refer to the base of the mountain, which is the lowest point, not the highest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: what was the name of clarks african american helper? A:","output":"A: The African American helper that accompanied Clark during the Lewis and Clark expedition was named York. He was not only a helper but also a crucial member of the Corps of Discovery, which was the group that set out to explore and map the newly acquired western portion of the United States after the Louisiana Purchase. York was born into slavery around 1770, and he was owned by William Clark's father, John Clark. York later became the personal servant to William Clark. When President Thomas Jefferson tasked Meriwether Lewis and William Clark with embarking on their expedition, Clark brought York along as a valuable team member. He was known to be physically strong and had excellent hunting, tracking, and survival skills. This made him an important asset to the group. During their journey, York played a significant role in interactions with the various Native American tribes they encountered. Many of the tribes, never having seen an African American person, were fascinated by York's appearance and color. This curiosity fostered goodwill and diplomatic relationships and helped smooth over some potential conflicts and disputes. In addition to his responsibilities as a hunter, York carried out other important tasks, such as helping with navigation, scouting, and assisting in setting up camps. He also participated in decision-making, which was something that other enslaved individuals of the time were not typically allowed to do. This unusual level of participation indicates the respect and value the other members of the expedition held for York. Despite his significant contributions to the Lewis and Clark expedition, York's life after the journey remains unclear. There are conflicting accounts of his status following the expedition. Some reports state that he was granted his freedom but had difficulty adjusting to life as a free man. Other accounts suggest that he was not granted his freedom until years later and faced considerable hardship. Nonetheless, York's story is an essential part of the history of the Lewis and Clark expedition and the role of African Americans in the exploration and development of the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).   - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - Prince of Orange is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title \\"Prince of Orange\\" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. The title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. The title descends via absolute primogeniture since 1983, meaning that its holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties, rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war.  - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.  - Frederick William I (14 August 1688  31 May 1740), known as the 'Soldier King,' was the King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg from 1713 until his death, as well as the father of Frederick the Great. He was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel.  - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.  - Francesco Guerini ( fl . 1740 -- 1770 ) was a Neapolitan violinist and composer whose works were published throughout Europe in the mid 18th century . While his birthdate is unknown , Guerini worked in The Hague for the Prince of Orange from 1740 until 1760 , at which time he moved to London , where he was active until 1770 . Most of Guerini 's published compositions were sonatas for one or two violins and continuo , but he also wrote keyboard works as well as Six Sonates / A deux Flûtes , ou deux Violons ... Ouevre III ( with no continuo ) , Paris , ca . 1750 , or Six Solos for a Violoncello with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord , Opus 9 , first published in London in 1765 .  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan.  - William III (4 November 1650  8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death. It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \\"King Billy\\".  - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Frederick I (11 July 1657  25 February 1713), of the Hohenzollern dynasty, was (as Frederick III) Elector of Brandenburg (16881713) and Duke of Prussia in personal union (Brandenburg-Prussia). The latter function he upgraded to royalty, becoming the first King in Prussia (17011713). From 1707 he was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. He was also the paternal grandfather of Frederick the Great.  - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon.   - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre.

Title: Excellent Overview of a Brilliant Author Review: This compact anthology presents a fine selection of fiction and nonfiction by one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. The selections of essays and memoirs are especially good, and while it can't do full justice to Woolf's longer works, this volume does include several excerpts from her best novels.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math Problem Solve 38*q = 67*q - 34*q - 45 for q.","output":"Okay, kiddo, let's solve this step by step! The problem is: 38 * q = 67 * q - 34 * q - 45. Now, let's simplify and solve it! First, we have two operations with q (67*q - 34*q). We can combine them, by subtracting 34 from 67, we get 33. So, it becomes: 38 * q = 33 * q - 45 Now, we want to get all the operations with q on one side of the equation and the number on the other side. To do this, we will subtract 33*q from both sides. 38*q - 33*q = 33*q - 45 - 33*q Now, 38*q - 33*q on the left side becomes 5*q and 33*q - 33*q on the right side becomes 0. So, the equation looks like: 5 * q = -45 Now we want to find the value of q. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5. (5 * q) / 5 = -45 / 5 5/5 equals 1, so we have: q = -45 / 5 Now, let's divide -45 by 5, which equals -9. So, q = -9 And that's our final answer!

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

To start, all you need is a teaspoon of raw seeds in your pot. Boil the water as you normally do. Whether you use a kettle or have to microwave a cup of water is up to you, but water never gets in the way of tea. When you’ve got the water piping hot, pour it into the teapot. Time flies and after all that hard work you did, it’s time for a well-deserved break. After about three minutes, the water will have already begun taking on the flavor of the seeds. However, let the seeds continue to steep for five to ten minutes. The tea you’ll get will be similar to black tea with a nutty flavor, which is way better than drinking fenugreek soaking water. The tea can be altered however you wish. Some tea-drinkers like adding milk or honey. Others like brewing tea with both seeds and tea leaves. It may be obvious, but don’t swallow the nuts while you’re trying to sip your tea. Hold a mesh strainer over your teacup and filter the water through it. These tea strainers shouldn’t be hard to find, so look wherever kitchen or tea supplies are sold. Maybe you like the tea so much you crave a second cup. Maybe you swallow it for the health benefits. Luckily for you, you can make yourself more tea no matter what. Add the seeds back into a second batch of hot water and go wild.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which age group was more in poverty, those under the age 18 or aged 65 or over?","output":"Title: Comparative Analysis of Poverty Rates: Age Groups Under 18 and 65 or Over Introduction The prevalence of poverty in the world is a concerning issue that affects various age groups. This article seeks to provide an in-depth analysis of poverty rates between two distinct age clusters: population under the age of 18 and individuals aged 65 or over. By examining available data and research, we will determine which age group experiences higher poverty rates and discuss possible reasons behind these disparities. Overview: Age and Poverty in Perspective The World Bank defines poverty as a condition where individuals lack essential means to fulfill basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. The subject of age and its relation to poverty becomes crucial as different age groups present unique challenges and vulnerabilities. Younger populations often face limited employment opportunities and inadequate access to education, while the elderly may struggle with deteriorating health, limited income sources, and diminished social support. As such, determining which age group experiences a higher poverty rate can inform policymakers and help them create targeted interventions to mitigate poverty. Children Under 18 in Poverty In many countries, children represent a significant portion of impoverished citizens. Studies suggest that children are particularly susceptible to poverty due to various factors, such as their reliance on parental income and unstable family situations. Data from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) suggests that worldwide, around 385 million children are living in extreme poverty. Factors contributing to child poverty include low parental education, inadequate job opportunities for parents, single-parent families, and limited access to quality education and healthcare. These factors often create a vicious cycle of poverty, where lower-skilled parents are unable to provide the necessary support, leading their children to face similar challenges in their future. Furthermore, child poverty is not solely a concern for developing countries. In high-income countries, such as the United States, around 17% of children under 18 were living in poverty in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Research has shown that child poverty in these countries can have detrimental long-term effects on education, health, and overall life quality. Elderly Population Aged 65 or Over in Poverty In contrast, the elderly population (aged 65 or over) also faces significant challenges contributing to poverty. As people age, their access to stable income sources often decreases, with few employment opportunities or inadequate retirement savings. Additionally, elderly individuals face increased healthcare costs due to age-related medical complications and chronic diseases.  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the poverty rate among elderly individuals in member countries was around 13.5% in 2019. In some countries, the elderly poverty rate is even higher; for instance, South Korea reported a staggering 43.8% poverty rate for people aged 65 or over, primarily due to an underdeveloped public pension system. Although social security and pension systems are implemented in many countries to address the income-related concerns of senior citizens, these programs are not universal and can vary greatly in effectiveness. As a result, a substantial proportion of the elderly population continues to struggle with poverty. Which Age Group is More Impoverished? While comparing the poverty rates for both age groups, it is evident that children under 18 are disproportionately affected by poverty in many countries. According to global data from UNICEF and OECD, the poverty rate for children is consistently higher than the rate for elderly individuals in both developing and developed countries.  Multiple reasons contribute to the higher poverty rates amongst children, including reliance on parental income, an increased likelihood of living in single-parent households, and limited access to basic amenities and education. Meanwhile, while the elderly also experience significant challenges, social security nets such as pension systems help alleviate the burden of poverty for many senior citizens.  Conclusion In conclusion, children under the age of 18 are generally more exposed to poverty than individuals aged 65 or over. Addressing child poverty remains a pressing issue worldwide, as it has lasting consequences on their education, health, and overall well-being. Policymakers must focus on implementing long-term interventions aimed at improving access to quality education, healthcare, and well-functioning family environments to help break the cycle of poverty for future generations. Simultaneously, efforts should continue to strengthen social security nets for the elderly population to ensure they can live comfortably in their twilight years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In some jurisdictions, copyright or the right to enforce it can be contractually assigned to a third party which did not have a role in producing the work. When this outsourced litigator appears to have no intention of taking any copyright infringement cases to trial, but rather only takes them just far enough through the legal system to identify and exact settlements from suspected infringers, critics commonly refer to the party as a \\"copyright troll.\\" Such practices have had mixed results in the U.S. Question: What do these lawsuits have in the U.S.?","output":"In the United States, these lawsuits initiated by \\"copyright trolls\\" have had a significant impact on various aspects of the American legal landscape, intellectual property rights, and the creative industries. Below is a detailed analysis of how these litigation strategies have affected different areas. 1. Impact on legal landscape: Fear of Litigation: Many individuals and businesses, particularly in the creative industry, are living in fear of being targeted by copyright trolls. These lawsuit threats lead to apprehensions and can stifle creativity or result in excessive caution when developing and distributing new content. Settlement Pressure: The main goal of copyright trolls is to achieve monetary settlements from alleged infringers without genuine intention of ultimately taking the case to trial. Consequently, the legal landscape has witnessed a surge in pre-litigation settlement demands from aggressive litigants, often accompanied by threatening letters and scare tactics. This pressure induces numerous people to settle just to avoid the costly, time-consuming, and stress-inducing trial process. Chilling Effect: The tactics employed by copyright trolls create a chilling effect on free speech and creative expression, as creators may self-censor to avoid potential legal trouble. This can hinder innovation and progress in the creative industry, as individuals and entities become wary of sharing their own work or collaborating with others due to the fear of litigation. 2. Impact on intellectual property rights: Dilution of Copyright Protection: Copyright serves as a critical legal protection for creators' works, ensuring that they may fairly profit from their investment in time, energy, and creativity. However, the excessive use of litigation by copyright trolls to intimidate suspected infringers can reduce public regard for this protective mechanism and lead to a dilution of the underlying values and goals of copyright law. Misuse of Copyright: Copyright trolls exploit the legal system to enforce copyrights selectively, often against unsuspecting defendants, thereby undermining the core objectives of promoting creative expression and providing individual artists with a means to protect their work. This manipulative use of copyright law exacerbates public skepticism regarding the just enforcement of intellectual property rights. 3. Impact on creative industries: Loss of Resources: Entities, particularly smaller ones with fewer resources, may suffer financial and operational setbacks after being targeted by copyright trolls. Legal fees, settlement payments, or the expense of rebranding or redeveloping content can cut into budget allocations for business growth and innovation. Stifled Innovation: A toxic environment, where creators continuously worry about potential legal threats, threatens to stifle innovation. Setbacks in the creative industries can have broader economic implications as the market loses out on potentially groundbreaking work due to the fear of litigation. 4. Impact on U.S. courts: Court Congestion: The exponential growth in the number of lawsuits filed by copyright trolls adds to the burden on U.S. courts. Judges and court personnel are forced to devote substantial time and effort to these cases, which are often brought without the genuine intent to prosecute. This congestion slows down the judicial system and delays the resolution of other non-related matters. In summary, the lawsuits initiated by copyright trolls in the United States have had mixed results on both a legal level and within the creative and intellectual property spheres. These litigation tactics have generated fear, uncertainty, and skepticism among creators, disrupted the creative industry, and infringed upon the core objectives of copyright protection. Moreover, these lawsuits have severely impacted the efficiency and reputation of the U.S. legal system. In recent years, efforts to counteract these harms have emerged, such as revisions to copyright legislation and judicial responses that discourage exploitative litigation practices or award penalties to copyright trolls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The restaurant's warm and inviting atmosphere offered a cozy setting for a perfect evening with friends. From the moment we stepped through the door, the staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive. Our server, Maria, offered excellent recommendations, including the house special, Linguine al Frutti di Mare, which was simply divine. The dish was bursting with fresh seafood flavors and perfectly cooked pasta - a true delight for the taste buds. The ambiance of La Dolce Vita was further enhanced by the lovely live music playing in the background, which created a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. As for the value for money, we found the pricing to be reasonable given the high quality of food and excellent service. If I were to offer any constructive criticism, it would be that the dessert menu could have a bit more variety. However, the Tiramisu we shared was still a delicious end to a wonderful meal. In conclusion, La Dolce Vita provided an incredible dining experience that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking authentic Italian cuisine served in a welcoming and enjoyable setting. I will definitely return for another delightful evening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 2010 Pulitzer Prizes for Letters, Drama and Music Paul Harding won the fiction prize for his novel “Tinkers,” while the drama award went to the musical “Next to Normal,” with music by Tom Kitt and book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey. Liaquat Ahamed won the history award for “Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World,” the biography prize went to T. J. Stiles for “The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt” and the general nonfiction prize went to David E. Hoffman for “The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy.” Jennifer Higdon won the music prize for her Violin Concerto while the poetry award went to Rae Armantrout for “Versed.” The complete list of winners in Letters, Drama and Music is below. FICTION: “Tinkers,” by Paul Harding “Tinkers,” a debut novel, is about the memories of a dying man, George Washington Crosby, who remembers being abandoned by his father, an epileptic. Mr. Harding, 42, teaches creative writing at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop and said the seed of the novel came from his grandfather’s spare reminisces of his own father. “I could never get him to elaborate on it,” Mr. Harding said. “So of course it became irresistible to me.” Finalists: “Love in Infant Monkeys,” by Lydia Millet; “In Other Rooms, Other Wonders,” by Daniyal Mueenuddin. DRAMA: “Next to Normal,” music by Tom Kitt; book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey. “Next to Normal,” about a family shattered by mental illness, is the eighth musical to win in the 92 years of the category. The Pulitzer Board commended the work for expanding “the scope of subject matter for musicals.” Mr. Kitt, 36, and Mr. Yorkey, 39, writing partners since 1994, said they had been inspired by the last two musicals to win the Pulitzer, “Rent” (1996) and “Sunday in the Park With George” (1985). “They broke ground the way we wanted to,” Mr. Yorkey said. Finalists: “The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity,” by Kristoffer Diaz; “Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,” by Rajiv Joseph; “In the Next Room (or the vibrator play),” by Sarah Ruhl. HISTORY: “Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World,” by Liaquat Ahamed Long before the banking system buckled in 2008, Mr. Ahamed, a 57-year-old economist born in Kenya, was already examining the 1930s to see what lessons could be gleaned for our own era. His book, begun in 2004 and the first he has written, is, the award citation says, “a compelling account” of how four powerful central bankers “played crucial roles in triggering the Great Depression” with mistaken policies. Finalists: “Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford’s Forgotten Jungle City,” by Greg Grandin; “Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815,” by Gordon S. Wood. BIOGRAPHY: “The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt,” by T.J. Stiles Vanderbilt is one of those names that Americans instantly recognize, but Mr. Stiles, 45, said he was drawn to the founder of the dynasty because he was “one of the most misunderstood of the major figures in American history.” Writing about “the Commodore” was a challenge, Mr. Stiles said, because he did not keep a diary or leave behind letters or documents. But scouring 19th-century public records and the papers of Vanderbilt’s various railway corporations helped Mr. Stiles produce what the award citation called “a penetrating portrait of a complex, self-made titan.” Finalists: “Woodrow Wilson: A Biography,” by John Milton Cooper Jr.; “Cheever: A Life,” by Blake Bailey. POETRY: “Versed,” by Rae Armantrout In her ninth volume of poetry, Ms. Armantrout, 62, explored themes of war and illness, driven by the war in Iraq and her own diagnosis of adrenal cortical cancer. “You could say there are things happening in your body that you can’t control and you don’t want them to be happening,” said Ms. Armantrout, “and there are things in your society that you can’t control and you don’t want them to be happening.” Finalists: “Tryst,” by Angie Estes; “Inseminating the Elephant,” by Lucia Perillo. GENERAL NONFICTION: “The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy,” by David E. Hoffman Mr. Hoffman, 56, a contributing editor and former Moscow bureau chief for The Washington Post, relied heavily on never-before-seen documents from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. “I hope to open people’s eyes that secrecy, mistrust and suspicion are as dangerous as weapons of mass destruction,” Mr. Hoffman said Monday. The Pulitzer Board called the book “a well-documented narrative that examines the terrifying doomsday competition between two superpowers.” Finalists: “How Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamities,” by John Cassidy; “The Evolution of God,” by Robert Wright. MUSIC: “Violin Concerto,” by Jennifer Higdon, premiered Feb. 6, 2009, in Indianapolis Ms. Higdon, 47, won for the concerto she composed for the young soloist Hilary Hahn, which was first heard in a performance by Ms. Hahn and the Indianapolis Symphony on Feb. 6, 2009. Ms. Higdon, born in Brooklyn, took up composition when she was 21. She writes in an accessible, melodic style. Finalists: “String Quartet No. 3,” by Fred Lerdahl, premiered on Dec. 8, 2009, in Cleveland; “Steel Hammer,” by Julia Wolfe, premiered on Nov. 13, 2009, in Gainesville, Fla.","output":"The 2010 Pulitzer Prizes for Letters, Drama, and Music were awarded to various acclaimed works.

Review: I figured didn't have very long to go in this world, so I purchased this model kitchenaid blender, thinking it would be a stalwart appliance much like my stand mixer. In my opinion, the jar is flimsily designed and does not lock onto the stand. With such a powerful motor, I have to stand there and hold the jar onto the base the whole time while blending. The \\"slow-start\\" feature is a joke. It does blend well and cleans fairly easily (and we don't have a dishwasher), which is why I gave it two stars. It is also VERY loud. It's going back to the store and until I find another blender, the old 12-speed Osterizer is coming back out of the cabinet. Answer: A:","output":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. The author of the review expresses their disappointment with the KitchenAid blender, which they had purchased with high expectations. They compare it unfavorably to their older Osterizer, which they have clearly had a positive experience with. Several negative aspects of the product are mentioned, including a flimsily designed jar, the need to hold the jar onto the base while blending, and a perceived lack of effectiveness in the slow-start feature. Additionally, the reviewer notes that the blender is very loud. They only give it two stars, in part due to the blender's blending and cleaning performance; however, the overall sentiment is clearly negative, ultimately resulting in the decision to return it to the store and continue using their old Osterizer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The lad preferred shooting with a rifle instead of a shotgun because the","output":"precision and skill required appealed to him more. He had always been fascinated by the intricacies of marksmanship, and the challenge of hitting a target from a distance enthralled him. His fascination with rifles began when he was just a young boy, growing up on his family's farm. The vast acres of land provided the perfect playground for him to explore and nurture his love for the outdoors. Unlike most kids his age, he didn't spend his days playing video games. Instead, he spent countless hours outside, trekking through the woods, climbing trees, and observing the wildlife that inhabited the property. His father, a former Marine sharpshooter, had passed on his knowledge and interest in firearms to his son. From the first time the lad held a rifle, he felt an overwhelming sense of power and responsibility, a connection to a legacy that had been passed down from generation to generation. As the years went by, the lad honed his skills and became quite the marksman himself. His confidence in his abilities grew exponentially, and he began challenging himself by setting targets at varying distances and attempting to hit them with accuracy and precision. He spent hours researching and studying the many technical aspects of rifle shooting, such as windage, elevation, and bullet trajectory. He applied those principles during his practice sessions, further perfecting his technique. The lad even went the extra mile of polishing and maintaining his rifle after each use, treating it with reverence and respect. Despite his love for rifles, the lad never felt comfortable with shotguns. He found the weapon too crude and unsophisticated, lacking the precision and elegance of a rifle. The kickback from a shotgun bruised his shoulder, and the spread of the shot pellets seemed uncontrollable and inefficient. He felt it lacked the finesse that came with rifle shooting. One day, while out practicing in the woods, the lad stumbled upon a hidden glen that appeared to be untouched by time. The dense forest opened up to reveal a clearing surrounded by ancient, towering oaks, and a small pond glittered in the sunlight, creating a magical atmosphere. The lad decided that this would be the perfect location to hone his skill and become one with nature. He set up a series of targets around the clearing, ranging from simple paper bullseyes to life-size silhouettes of game animals. With each practice session, he became more in tune with his rifle, his breath, and his surroundings. The voices of doubt and worry in his mind were silenced, and his shots found their mark every time. His dedication and passion for rifle shooting did not go unnoticed by the local hunting community. As he matured, the lad participated in numerous shooting competitions, earning top honors and garnering the respect of fellow marksmen. He became a role model for younger generations, as his father had been for him. The lad's prowess with a rifle opened doors to opportunities most could only dream of. He was invited to join elite hunting expeditions across the globe, and his marksmanship skills were sought out by law enforcement and military organizations alike for specialized training. Despite his growing renown, the lad never lost sight of the roots that not only instilled his love for rifle shooting but his deep connection to nature as well. In time, the lad chose to return home and take over his family's land, with a clear vision of preserving the natural landscape that had shaped him. The lad turned the property into a sanctuary for wildlife, dedicated to conservation and education. He developed programs that taught future generations about the importance of responsible hunting and the art of marksmanship, passing on his knowledge just as his father had done for him, ensuring the continuation of a cherished family legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question When there is a potential difference across the conductors (e.g., when a capacitor is attached across a battery), an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge +Q to collect on one plate and negative charge −Q to collect on the other plate. If a battery has been attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time, no current can flow through the capacitor. However, if a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, a displacement current can flow. How do charges accumulate on each plate of a capacitor after an electric field has developed across the dielectric?","output":"When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source such as a battery, charges accumulate on each plate of the capacitor due to the electric field developed across the dielectric. The process can be elaborated in the following steps: 1. Connecting the capacitor to the voltage source: When a capacitor is connected to a battery or any voltage source, a potential difference is created between its two plates, driving the electric field across the dielectric material. 2. Charge separation: In response to the potential difference, free electrons present on the negatively charged plate of the capacitor (connected to the negative terminal of the voltage source) will be repelled and start to move towards the positively charged plate (connected to the positive terminal of the voltage source). 3. Charge accumulation and polarization: As electrons begin to accumulate on the positively charged plate, it builds up a negative charge (-Q). Concurrently, the original positive charges on that plate get neutralized, and the plate loses electrons, which effectively leaves a positive charge (+Q) on the other plate. The dielectric material between the plates becomes polarized, creating dipoles, which align themselves in the direction of the electric field. The buildup of these charge layers on the plates creates what is known as \\"capacitance.\\" 4. Steady-state: Once the voltage across the capacitor equals the voltage provided by the battery, the movement of electrons comes to a halt, and no more current flows through the circuit. The capacitor is now fully charged, and the accumulated charges remain on the plates until the capacitor is disconnected from the voltage source. 5. Displacement current: When a time-varying voltage is applied across the capacitor, charges will continuously flow on and off the plates, creating a displacement current. This type of current does not require the movement of physical charge carriers, such as electrons, throughout the dielectric material but instead relies on the variation in electric field and polarization of the dielectric. In summary, after an electric field has developed across the dielectric, charges accumulate on each plate of a capacitor, following the process of charge separation, polarization, and establishing steady-state. The potential difference between the plates drives the movement of free electrons, resulting in charge accumulation and the buildup of a polarized dielectric layer, which ultimately determines the capacitor's ability to store energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Everything that goes in the HTML body displays on the web page. This is the tag to add a heading to your HTML document. A Heading is large bold text that typically goes at the top of your HTML document. This can be the title of your page or a greeting. This tag closes your heading.  Add additional headings as you go. There are six different headings that you can create by using the <h1></h1> through <h6></h6> tags. These create headings of different sizes. For example, to create three different-sized headings in succession, you might write the following:  <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1> <h2>My name is Bob.</h2> <h3>I hope you like it here.</h3>     The headings shows the priority or importance of the text. But its not necessary to use a higher heading if you want to use any lower heading. One can directly use H3, even if there is no H1 in your post. This is the tag to open a paragraph. Paragraph text is used to display normal sized text. This can be a description for your web page or any other information you wish to share. This the tag to close your paragraph text. The following is an example of paragraph text in HTML:  <p>This is my paragraph.</p>    You can add multiple paragraph lines in a row in order to create a series of paragraphs under one heading. You can change the color of any text by framing the text with the <font color=\\"color\\"> and </font> tags. Make sure to type your preferred color into the \\"color\\" section (you'll keep the quotes). You can turn any text (e.g., headers) into a different color with this set of tags. For example, to turn a paragraph's text blue, you would write the following code: <p><font color=\\"blue\\">Whales are majestic creatures.</font></p>  You can add bolds, italics and other text formats using HTML.   The following are examples of how you can format text using HTML tags: <b>Bold text</b> <i>Italic text</i> <u>Underlined text</u> <sub>Subscript text</sub> <sup>Superscript text</sup>    If you use bold and italic text for emphasis, not just for styling, use the <strong> and <em> elements instead of <b> and <i>. This makes your web page easier to understand when using technologies like a screen reader or the reader mode provided in some browsers.","output":"The given text primarily focuses on the basics of HTML tags, explaining their functions, and providing examples. The \`<body>\` tag is the main container that houses all the visible contents of an HTML document. Headings are crucial elements within a webpage, as they not only stylize the text but also semantically structure the information, aiding in accessibility. The \`<h1>\` through \`<h6>\` tags facilitate the creation of headings in six different sizes, with \`<h1>\` being the largest and \`<h6>\` being the smallest. For instance, the example provided demonstrates three headings using \`<h1>\`, \`<h2>\`, and \`<h3>\`. Even though the heading hierarchy establishes the precedence of text, one can directly use \`<h3>\` without necessarily including an \`<h1>\` tag first. In addition, the text describes how to use paragraph tags (\`<p>\` and \`</p>\`) to display normal-sized text, such as descriptions or other pieces of information. It's possible to create multiple paragraphs under one heading by inserting multiple paragraph lines consecutively.  Moreover, HTML allows you to modify various text attributes such as color, boldness, and italics. To apply a color, use the \`<font>\` tag with the \\"color\\" attribute. Formatting can also be achieved using tags like \`<b>\`, \`<i>\`, and \`<u>\`. For emphasis, however, it's recommended to use semantic tags like \`<strong>\` and \`<em>\` instead of \`<b>\` and \`<i>\`, as these are more comprehensible for screen readers and reader mode functionalities in browsers.

Step 5: Flesh out the second half of the movie plot In the second half of the film, the KKK begins to escalate its hateful activities, causing fear and unrest among the townspeople. This forces our group of protagonists to put aside their differences and work closely to uncover the Klan's plans. As they dig deeper, they learn that the KKK's resurgence is a result of certain prominent figures in town, who have been secretly supporting the organization. Together, they must gather evidence against these individuals and bring them to justice, all while dealing with the personal costs that come with fighting against such a formidable enemy. Step 6: Create the resolution of the story Ultimately, the group succeeds in dismantling the KKK's presence in their town, but not without loss. Some choose to leave the town, while others decide to stay and continue working towards building a more inclusive and accepting community. The story ends on a hopeful note, with the characters looking forward to a future in which such organizations no longer have a place. Final Answer: In this movie plot, the second half of the film focuses on the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan as a reformed racist organization, which disrupts the lives of the townspeople and protagonists. The main characters must work together to dismantle the organization, reveal the hidden supporters behind it, and fight for a more inclusive town. Throughout their struggle, they confront their personal challenges and losses but ultimately succeed in stopping the KKK and making their community a better place to live."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess   to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge  . Question: What can we learn from Carla's story? Options: A: BED is an incurable disease. B: BED has something to do with genes. C: Going on a diet won't help BED patients. D: BED patients should pay attention to their food. The answer to this question is:","output":"C: Going on a diet won't help BED patients."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have been an admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work for years, and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work, thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. The severe beauty of the ship-breaking yard in Bangladesh, the stone quarry in Vermont, the enormous assembly plant in China, the beleaguered old neighbourhoods in Shanghai that are just waiting to be torn down: these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker. At times I thought of old TV documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic-mold factories; the sort of stuff I grew up watching. Burtynsky's work has the great value of pointing out how the industrial activity has only shifted to Asia, it has not stopped. The strangest scene for me was the computer scrap-yard somewhere in China--the waste had a threatening air about it, while the workers were very jovial. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive. The reviewer expresses admiration for Edward Burtynsky's work and their appreciation for the various landscapes captured by the photographer and filmmaker.

Question: suppose less satellites packed into a capsule happens, how will it affect LESS electricity being produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The process described is for the generation of electricity through a coal-fired steam station. The scenario presented supposes that there are fewer satellites packed into a capsule, and the question asks how this will affect the production of less electricity and the perturbation's influence on the second mentioned effect. There is no direct relationship between the number of satellites packed into a capsule and the electricity produced by a coal-fired steam station. Satellites are used for various purposes, such as communication, weather monitoring, and navigation. They do not play a direct role in the production of electricity through coal-fired steam stations. With fewer satellites packed into a capsule, the only potential impact on the coal-fired steam station could be in terms of data transmission and monitoring. Utilities use communication and monitoring systems to operate their power plants, which may require satellite communications. However, this would not significantly impact the amount of electricity produced by the coal-fired steam station. In summary, fewer satellites packed into a capsule would likely have no effect on the amount of electricity produced by a coal-fired steam station. The perturbation in this scenario does not have a direct influence on the second effect mentioned, i.e., the force of the steam making the mechanism turn and generating electricity. The coal-fired steam station would continue to produce electricity as long as it has access to coal and water as input resources, and the operational mechanisms remain efficient and functional."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ask Annie - Are Moms Less Likely to Be Hired? - FORTUNE Dear Annie: I am a 35-year-old woman CPA with extensive experience in finance and accounting. Now that the job market in my field seems to have picked up, I've been looking around for a better job, and I'm noticing something that keeps happening over and over again. In job interviews, everything will be going along fine until I happen to mention that I have two children (ages eight and six). At that point, the interviewer seems to lose interest, or his or her interest turns from avid to merely polite. My friends tell me I'm just imagining it, but I don't think so. Your opinion, please? Proud but Puzzled Mom Dear Puzzled: You wouldn't believe (or then again, maybe you would) how many women have written to me with this same observation over the past few years. Just last month, for instance, an unemployed marketing manager wrote: \\"As soon as I let slip that I have little kids, it's as if I had the plague. Job interviewers don't run screaming from the room, but they do find an excuse to wrap up the interview fast.\\" Of course, no employer is going to admit to preferring job applicants who are childless, and human-resources people who I've asked about this pooh-poohed the whole idea. Executive coaches could offer only the odd anecdote to support the notion that women with children have a harder time getting hired. Now, however, comes evidence that what you're experiencing may be a widespread phenomenon. At an American Sociological Society meeting in Philadelphia in August, two Cornell University sociologists, Shelley J. Correll and Stephen Benard, presented a paper called \\"Getting a Job: Is There a Motherhood Penalty?\\" It's based on research showing that not only are moms less likely to get hired than men (with or without kids) or childless women, but also that they're likely to be paid less. Correll, an associate professor of sociology, and Benard, a graduate student, conducted an experiment wherein 84 men and 108 women Cornell undergraduates were asked to evaluate several female candidates for the same mid-level management position. All of the hypothetical applicants were equally qualified, with strong success in their previous jobs. The only difference: Some candidates' profiles noted in passing that they had children and were active in parent-teacher associations, while the other candidates' profiles said nothing about children. The result: The student evaluators said they would hire 84% of the women without children, but only 47% of the mothers. (In case you're wondering, the female evaluators were no more kindly disposed toward the moms than were their male peers.) What's more, the gap in starting pay between mothers and childless women averaged 11,000. \\"In fact, the more children a mother was described as having, the lower the salary that the test subjects said they would offer,\\" notes Correll. \\"Other studies have shown that the reverse is true for men. The more children they have, the higher the salary offers they receive.\\" What's going on here? \\"We're not saying that employers discriminate against mothers because they don't like them,\\" Correll says. \\"Motherhood is a role held in very high esteem in our society. However, whether we realize it, consciously or not, our cultural ideal of motherhood is that of a mother who will devote herself first and foremost to her kids, 24/7 if necessary. So, to many people, motherhood and a careerespecially in a company that also demands 24/7 of its employeesare seen as just not compatible. Fatherhood, on the other hand, presents no such dilemma, since traditionally fathers have been less involved with raising kids and more expected to be primary breadwinners.\\" Ah. In light of the fact that, according to the Census Bureau, 72% of American women have children, these lingering biases against hiring mothers and paying them equally could go a long way toward explaining the persistent wage gap between men and women overall. That's particularly so since, other Census Bureau figures show, the gap is narrowest when women are in their 20s, that is, when many have not yet had kids. In 2004, for example, college-educated women in their 40s who were working full time earned, on average, 38% less than their male counterparts. Between men and women in their 20s, the gap was much less, at an average of 25%. What, if anything, can moms do about this? \\"Not mentioning that you have children, or trying to hide the fact, is obviously a limited strategy,\\" notes Correll. \\"We're doing another study now to try and determine whether companies with 'family-friendly' and 'work-life balance' policies are less likely to discriminate against mothers than employers that don't have such policies. But in the meantime, what I hear is the advice that mothers give each other.\\" Such as? \\"Well, one I've heard over and over again is, if you have to take a day off to care for a sick child, don't tell anyone the child is sick. When you call in to the office, say that you are the one who's sick.\\" She adds: \\"Either way, you're missing a day of work, so why does it matter? But it does.\\" Folks, I don't know about you, but I find this appalling. I'm bracing myself for a barrage of comments on this subject, from all conceivable points of view, so...bring 'em on!

But, as we can't drink seawater, how can it be important? Every part of our seas and oceans contains an amazing number of animals and fish that live at different ocean depths. Most of the different species of animals and fish depend on simple plants for their food. These simple plants called algae   drift near the surface of the ocean and use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen. In fact, algae produce over half of the oxygen people breathe. How important seawater is! Each plant or animal in our seas and oceans is an important link in a food chain. The algae are eaten in large amounts by microscopic animals, which are in turn consumed by larger animals. These food chains are delicately balanced. The bad news about the food chains in the oceans is that they are under threat because of man. People once thought that the oceans were so big that it didn't matter if we dumped rubbish into them or caught huge quantities of fish and whales for food. But we now know this is not true and fish stocks in the oceans have started to drop. Thankfully, the world is taking steps to protect the future of our oceans by introducing international agreements to protect marine habitats. Most countries have introduced fishing restrictions to protect fish stocks in the oceans and new techniques are being pioneered to cope with pollution. Finally, the importance of protecting oceans is being made known to more people. This is just the beginning of a long process to protect the oceans for our future. We depend on the oceans for fish which are an important part of the human diet. How important seawater is!

Step 2: Establish the setting The movie takes place in the busy metropolis of Los Angeles, specifically in and around the Walt Disney Concert Hall, where a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 is scheduled. Step 3: The discovery Just before the performance, Sarah Miller discovers a mysterious letter addressed to the orchestra. It states that a bomb has been hidden within the Walt Disney Concert Hall, set to detonate at the exact moment of the concluding performance - the last note of Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy.\\" Panicked, she brings the letter to the attention of the authorities. Step 4: Introduction of Jake Thompson Jake Thompson is called in to lead the bomb squad in locating and defusing the bomb in time. He meets Sarah, who insists on helping him with the investigation due to her knowledge of the building and strong belief in the power of music, which she thinks the bomber is perverting.

First, let's combine the terms with 'd' in them: -54*d and 81*d When we add them together, we get: 27 * d (-54 + 81) Now, our equation looks like this: 27*d - 297 = 0 To solve for 'd', we need to get 'd' by itself.

We do this by adding 297 to both sides: 27*d - 297 + 297 = 0 + 297 This simplifies to: 27*d = 297 Now, we need to get 'd' by itself by dividing both sides of the equation by 27: 27*d / 27 = 297 / 27 This gives us our solution: d = 11 So, the value of 'd' in the equation is 11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened.  Which person's mutation can be passed on to their offspring?  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Answer:","output":"Kim's mutation can be passed on to her offspring since the mutation occurred in the DNA of her sex cells (germline mutation). Germline mutations affect the gametes, and when a zygote is formed during reproduction, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation, potentially causing a hereditary disease. In contrast, Holly's mutation occurred in her body cells (somatic mutation) and cannot be passed on to her offspring.

Write a summary based on this article: MUMBAI |      MUMBAI (Reuters) - Aspiring Bollywood actor Suraj Pancholi left prison on bail on Monday three weeks after being arrested over a possible role in the suicide of his actress girlfriend Jiah Khan.      Pancholi, 22, the son of Bollywood acting couple Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahab, was released after a Mumbai court set bail at 50,000 rupees (around 845).      \\"He has been let out on bail today. He had to pay 50,000 rupees,\\" Pancholi's lawyer Zamir Khan told Reuters by telephone.      Investigators had requested the court for more time to question him about Jiah Khan's death on June 3. Her last call was to Pancholi.      Pancholi was arrested on June 10 after Khan's mother Rabia went public with a letter apparently written by the 25-year-old actress before she hanged herself in her Mumbai apartment.      In the letter widely published in the media, Khan spoke of being physically and emotionally abused and of having an abortion against her will although she did not mention any names.      Police have yet to file any charges against Pancholi. Suicide is a crime in India and abetting suicide is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.      Khan, whose real name was Nafisa Khan, made her Bollywood debut in 2007 with Ram Gopal Varma's \\"Nishabd\\", playing the 18-year-old female lead opposite Amitabh Bachchan.      \\"Nishabd\\" received mixed reviews and did not do well at the Bollywood box office but Khan went on to play supporting roles in two more films, the psychological thriller \\"Ghajini\\" in 2008 and the comedy \\"Housefull\\" in 2010.      (Editing by Tony Tharakan and Paul Casciato) ||||| NEW DELHI – Bollywood starlet Jiah Khan's death on June 3 led to the arrest of her boyfriend, Suraj Pancholi, under suspicion that he abetted her suicide. The 22-year-old aspiring actor -- the son of veteran actors Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahab -- was reportedly named in a suicide note believed to be written by the 25-year-old Khan.      But the Bombay High Court granted Pancholi bail Monday, observing in its verdict: “No doubt that it was an unfortunate incident that a young girl has committed suicide. She [Khan] must have been impulsive and he [Pancholi] cannot be held solely responsible for it.”      PHOTOS: Indian Talent Going Global      Pancholi -- who filed his bail application on June 26 -- was granted bail on a 862 (50,000-rupee) bond and instructed to surrender his passport. He was told to report to the police every alternate day.      The court also observed that a letter purportedly written by the actress and recovered from her house could not be taken as a suicide note, as it was not addressed to anyone and was not dated.      “The question is if the script recovered from the deceased's house is addressed to the applicant [Pancholi], or is it just extracts from her diary? Whether it can be called a suicide note at all? When there is no date on it can it be linked to the day she committed suicide?...Therefore it cannot be said that the emotions expressed in the letter ever reached the applicant,” said the judgement.      The letter in question was found in Khan's bedroom by her mother and sister a few days after she hung herself from a ceiling fan on June 3. In the letter, Khan mentioned how she was “mentally harassed” by Pancholi and how she had also undergone an abortion. In his bail plea, Pancholi stated that he and Khan were in a “consensual relationship” and that the letter was being misused by her mother, Rabia Khan.      STORY: Bollywood Actress Jiah Khan Dies at 25      Observing that Pancholi never nurtured an intent to push the girl to commit suicide, the court stated, “She was in the relationship on her own volition. It all depends on the pscyhe of the person. It cannot be ignored that Jiah had suicidal tendencies. Earlier also she had attempted suicide, and it was the applicant [Pancholi] who took care of her.” The court added that the deceased's mother was not aware of this incident.      “It also appears that on the day of the incident there was some misunderstanding between the deceased and applicant due to which [Khan] was in a rage of fury,” the court stated further.      Khan was born in New York but moved back to India to pursue a career as an actress. She made her Bollywood debut in 2007, starring opposite Amitabh Bachchan in the film Nishabd, which was loosely based on Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita and generated controversy at the time. She also appeared in Ghajini with Aamir Khan. Her last role was in Housefull (2010) opposite Akshay Kumar. |||||","output":"Aspiring Bollywood actor Suraj Pancholi was released on bail after being arrested for his possible involvement in the suicide of his girlfriend, actress Jiah Khan.

Who developed the live attenuated polio vaccine which has led to hopes of global eradication of the virus?","output":"The live attenuated polio vaccine, also known as the oral polio vaccine (OPV), was developed by Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin, an American medical researcher, virologist, and physician. His efforts and discoveries concerning the polio vaccine played a significant role in moving the world closer to global eradication of the poliovirus. Dr. Albert Sabin was born in Bialystok, Poland, on August 26, 1906, and later immigrated to the United States with his family when he was a child. He pursued a medical degree and graduated from New York University College of Medicine in 1931. His interest in infectious diseases led him to focus on poliovirus research, which was a considerable public health concern in his time. Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. It primarily affects children and can lead to paralysis and even death. During the first half of the 20th century, polio outbreaks caused widespread panic in the United States and numerous other countries. In response, the scientific community directed significant resources towards developing a vaccine to combat the disease. Two major polio vaccines have contributed to the global decline of polio cases. The first one was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk, who introduced the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in 1955. This vaccine uses a 'killed' version of the virus and is injected into the patient, providing immunity without causing disease. However, the vaccine by Dr. Salk had limitations, as it required multiple injections and boosters to maintain long-term immunity. Dr. Albert Sabin addressed these limitations with the development of the oral polio vaccine. Introduced in the early 1960s, this live attenuated vaccine contains weakened (non-pathogenic) forms of the virus. When administered orally, the vaccine mimics a natural infection, offering individuals long-lasting immunity without the risk of severe side effects. Moreover, the vaccine can be easily administered, and its affordability made it ideal for widespread immunization campaigns. The implementation of worldwide vaccination campaigns using the oral polio vaccine has contributed significantly to the dramatic decrease in polio cases. According to the World Health Organization, the number of cases has declined by more than 99 percent since 1988. Today, while the global eradication remains an ongoing effort, the progress achieved is largely attributed to the groundbreaking work of researchers like Dr. Albert Sabin and his live attenuated polio vaccine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This decision has been long-awaited, as Musharraf faces multiple trials, including one for high treason and several others for charges like murder and abductions. His lawyers argue that this decision will facilitate medicinal treatments for the ailing former president, whose health has deteriorated over recent years. Pervez Musharraf, who was the country's president from 2001 to 2008, has faced various criminal cases based on charges such as his imposition of an unconstitutional emergency rule in 2007, assassinating in December 2007 former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who Musharraf is accused of failing to protect, and the 'Lal Masjid Mosque' operation against Islamic militants, which resulted in over 100 deaths of suspected insurgents, in addition to innocent civilians in 2006. The former president left Pakistan in March 2016, following a travel ban removal granted on medical grounds, but considering the present circumstances and the status of his health, the possibility of return seemed extremely uncertain. The recent Supreme Court ruling has stirred controversy amongst Pakistanis and raised questions regarding its political implications. As the country prepares for parliamentary elections scheduled later this year, the decision's timing has proven worrisome for some, who suspect the possibility of a coordinated political move designed to influence the upcoming elections. However, others see this as a sign of the judiciary's independence and transparency, maintaining that the decision is a clear vindication of the allegations against the former president. Moreover, this verdict has also sparked debates amongst legal experts and political analysts about its potential impact on Musharraf's ongoing trials. Some argue that the Supreme Court's decision might not guarantee his return to Pakistan. Given his health situation, it is unclear whether Musharraf will come back to face the numerous charges leveled against him. In contrast, others think it could translate into a revival of Musharraf's political career. Laying the groundwork for his return could enable the former military ruler to actively participate in the upcoming general elections and use his connections, experience, and influence to garner support in a bid to re-enter the political landscape. Nonetheless, to some, it seems that the case involving the former President of Pakistan is emblematic of the broader issues that the country faces with regard to the intersection of politics, law, and military power. Observers predict that the ultimate trajectory of Musharraf's trials will serve as a litmus test for the judiciary's efficacy, independence, and integrity in a nation where political and security issues are frequently intertwined. In conclusion, the lifting of the travel ban on former President Pervez Musharraf by Pakistan's Supreme Court will not just govern his personal decisions and future but also significantly influence the political climate of the country. As unforeseen circumstances continue to unfold, a balance between maintaining the judiciary's independence and ensuring its accountability has become essential to solidifying Pakistan's democratic foundations. Whether someone views this recent development as an opportunity for the nation to demonstrate commitment to the rule of law or an attempt to meddle in the upcoming elections, it undoubtedly has repercussions that extend far beyond the former president's situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: get drunk, meet new people, drinking beer, enjoy yourself, having sex  Why is \\"having sex\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Having sex\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because attending parties is frequently associated with socializing, building connections, and engaging in various types of interactions with others, including romantic and sexual encounters. While it is not guaranteed that going to a party with the opposite sex will lead to a sexual experience, it is a possibility that some people might consider, making it a plausible answer from a human perspective. Parties offer an environment where individuals can feel more at ease in expressing themselves and initiating conversations with people they find attractive, including members of the opposite sex. Alcohol consumption, often a part of such gatherings, can further lower people's inhibitions and increase the likelihood of flirtatious or intimate behavior. Consequently, there is a connection between attending parties and the potential for sexual encounters in the context of human social interactions. However, it is essential to emphasize that consensual, respectful, and responsible behavior must always be maintained in any situation, regardless of the setting or circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.  Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... Question: Generally, how long does individual testimony before a congressional committee usually last? Answer: The answer is:","output":"Individual testimony before a congressional committee can vary significantly in length depending on the nature of the hearing, the topic being discussed, the number of witnesses providing testimony, and the complexity of the issues being addressed. In some cases, testimonies can be relatively brief, lasting only a few hours, whereas in other cases, they can extend over several days or even weeks. Several factors can influence the duration of individual testimony, including: 1. The nature of the hearing: Hearings can be categorized as legislative, oversight, and investigative hearings. Legislative hearings are held for discussing proposed legislation and typically involve testimonies from experts, stakeholders, and interest groups. Oversight hearings review the effectiveness of existing laws and government programs. Investigative hearings are focused on gathering information regarding specific incidents or possible wrongdoings. Depending on the complexity of the subject matter, testimonies in these hearings can vary in length. 2. The topic being discussed: Some hearings deal with simple issues that can be addressed within a few hours, while others are more complex and require extensive testimonies and questioning. The length of testimony depends on how much information is needed to effectively address the topic at hand. 3. The number of witnesses providing testimony: If a hearing involves multiple witnesses, individual testimonies might be shorter to accommodate everyone's testimony within the designated time frame. Conversely, when there are fewer witnesses, individual testimonies might be more in-depth and longer. 4. The complexity of the issues being addressed: Some hearings deal with highly controversial or intricate topics that require witnesses to provide detailed explanations and extensive evidence. In such cases, individual testimonies may last several hours or even days. 5. The extent of questioning: The duration of individual testimony largely depends on how long it takes committee members to ask their questions and for the witness to provide satisfactory answers. If the questioning process is thorough and intense, testimonies may take longer than when questions are simple and straightforward. Overall, the length of individual testimony before a congressional committee can vary greatly, with factors such as the nature of the hearing, the topic, the number of witnesses, the complexity of the issues, and the rigor of questioning all contributing to the overall duration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Roman Republic As with most ancient civilizations, Rome's military served the triple purposes of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern and the majority of Rome's wars were characterized by one of two types. The first is the foreign war, normally begun as a counter-offensive or defense of an ally. The second is the civil war, which plagued the Roman Republic in its final century. Roman armies were not invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories. Over the centuries the Romans \\"produced their share of incompetents\\" who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of the greatest of Rome's enemies, such as Pyrrhus and Hannibal, to win early battles but lose the war. The history of Rome's campaigning is, if nothing else, a history of obstinate persistence overcoming appalling losses. Q: What would often lead Rome to wage war in foreign lands?","output":"Rome would often wage war in foreign lands to protect themselves or to help their allies.

Read this and answer the question The sky is usually clear above the desert and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert enjoys more than 3,600 h of bright sunshine annually or over 82% of the time and a wide area in the eastern part experiences in excess of 4,000 h of bright sunshine a year or over 91% of the time, and the highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4,300 h or 98% of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa). The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production. The constantly high position of the sun, the extremely low relative humidity, the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest continuously large area worldwide and certainly the hottest place on Earth during summertime in some spots. The average high temperature exceeds 38 °C (100.4 °F) - 40 °C (104 °F) during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high mountainous areas. The highest officially recorded average high temperature was 47 °C (116.6 °F) in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous with an elevation of 378 meters above sea level. It's the world's highest recorded average high temperature and only Death Valley, California rivals it. Other hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar, Timimoun, In Salah, Ouallene, Aoulef, Reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 meters above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs around 46 °C (114.8 °F) during the hottest months of the year. Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, has an average high temperature of 43.8 °C (110.8 °F), 46.4 °C (115.5 °F), 45.5 (113.9 °F). Furthermore, 41.9 °C (107.4 °F) in June, July, August and September. In fact, there are even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the Azalai, lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experiences around 3 – 5 months when the average high strictly exceeds 40 °C (104 °F). The southern central part of the desert experiences up to 6 – 7 months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds 40 °C (104 °F) which shows the constancy and the length of the really hot season in the Sahara. Some examples of this are Bilma, Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F) everywhere and can approach 30 °C (86 °F) in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert has a value in excess of 25 °C (77 °F). The sand and ground temperatures are even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature is extremely high as it can easily reach 80 °C (176 °F) or more. A sand temperature of 83.5 °C (182.3 °F) has been recorded in Port Sudan. Ground temperatures of 72 °C (161.6 °F) have been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of 75 °C (167 °F) has been measured in Borkou, northern Chad. Due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually features high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it's a myth that the nights are cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara. The average diurnal temperature range is typically between 13 °C (55.4 °F) and 20 °C (68 °F). The lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than 10 °C (50 °F), while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara.

Internal combustion engine versions of these cycles are, by their nature, not reversible.","output":"To determine if a heat engine and a heat pump are the same thing based on the provided text, let's analyze the information in the text step-by-step. 1. The text offers a domestic refrigerator as an example of a heat pump. 2. The text states that a heat pump is a \\"heat engine in reverse.\\" 3. It explains that work is used to create a heat differential in a heat pump. 4. Many cycles can run in reverse to move heat from the cold side to the hot side, making the cold side cooler and the hot side hotter. 5. Internal combustion engine versions of these cycles are not reversible, which implies that not all heat engines can function as heat pumps. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that a heat engine and a heat pump are not the same thing. A heat pump can be considered as a heat engine in reverse, meaning that while they both involve heat transfer processes, the direction of heat flow is opposite in each case. A heat engine converts heat energy into work, while a heat pump uses work to transfer heat from a lower temperature reservoir to a higher temperature reservoir.

Answer based on context: Following the death of General Advisor in Foreign Affairs Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns in 1902, Phya Suriyanuwat, the Siamese Minister in Paris, was instructed to find a replacement. Phya Suriya was unable to find a suitable candidate in Europe, and notified Phya Akaraj Varathon, the Siamese Minister in Washington, that under the circumstances, he had decided to engage an American. In 1903, former US diplomat Edward Henry Strobel took a leave of absence from his position as the Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard School of Law to represent the Kingdom of Siam in The Hague at the International Peace Court—which Rolin-Jaequemyns had been instrumental in founding. In 1906, Strobel moved to Bangkok to take the position of general advisor, where he died January 15, 1908. Among his successors were Jens Westengard, 1909-14, Wolcott Pitkin, 1915-17, Eldon James, and Francis B. Sayre—all but for Pitkin former Harvard law professors. \\"The Siamese government trusted the American Adviser in Foreign Affairs to act in the best interests of Siam. Authority and responsibility were delegated to him. He was permitted a considerable degree of freedom in his work. It was in his capacity as a lawyer, a jurist, an advocate, and a policy counselor that the American adviser contributed significantly to the successful conclusion of the treaty negotiations with the West.\\" An agreement on relations between the two countries was signed in Washington D.C. on December 16, 1920. What happened first: Strobel moved to Bangkok or an agreement between America and Siam?","output":"Okay, little buddy! Imagine a timeline of events, like steps in a fun story. First, Mr. Strobel moved to Bangkok (that's a big city in a place called Siam). That happened in 1906. Then, after some time, America and Siam became friends and signed an agreement. This happened on December 16, 1920. So, Mr. Strobel moved to Bangkok before the agreement between America and Siam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what typically travels long distances?\\" is \\"humans\\", given that  birds typically travel long distances? Available choices: A. Yes. B. No. A:","output":"B. No. While it is true that humans do travel long distances, the prompt specifically mentions that birds typically travel long distances as well. In this context, it is essential to assess the question based on the information provided, which makes a clear association with another species known for long-distance traveling: birds. Birds are known to travel extensive distances, particularly during migration periods. For certain species, this behavior is essential to their survival as they move in search of better environmental conditions, food, and opportunities for reproduction. This process enables birds to adapt to the changing climate and seasonal patterns. Some birds, known for their extraordinary migrating abilities, include the Arctic tern, bar-tailed godwit, and the sooty shearwater. In particular, Arctic terns are known to cover about 25,000 miles on their annual migratory journey from the Arctic to Antarctica and then back again. Humans, on the other hand, also travel long distances for various reasons, such as trade, exploration, work, leisure, and personal relationships. With the advent of technological advancements and globalization, travel among human beings has become relatively easier and more accessible. Nevertheless, our evolutionary and historical reasons for traveling cannot be directly compared to the seasonal migration patterns of birds that cover vast distances primarily as a response to environmental and survival needs. In light of this information, it is clear that within the context of the question, the more accurate answer would not be \\"humans\\" but rather would be an acknowledgment of the long-distance traveling nature of birds."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, when Mr. Hammond dies, Anne is sent to an orphanage where she eventually receives the wonderful news that she has been adopted by a couple on Prince Edward Island. Upon arriving in P.E.I, Anne is met at the train station by an elderly Matthew Cuthbert who is surprised to find a girl there instead of a boy. Matthew and his sister Marilla had requested a boy to help them with the farm chores. He decides that he couldn't very well just leave the girl at the train station. Matthew takes Anne to meet Marilla, and on the buggy ride home, becomes completely smitten with the red-haired orphan girl. When Anne Shirley arrives at the Cuthberts' farm, called \\"Green Gables\\", she is a precocious, romantic child desperate to be loved and highly sensitive about her red hair and homely looks. In her own unique headstrong manner, Anne manages to insult the town gossip, Rachel Lynde, in a dispute over her looks; smash her slate over Gilbert Blythe's head when he calls her \\"Carrots\\" on her first day of school; and accidentally dyes her hair green in an effort to turn her red hair black and salvage her wounded pride.

At least that's the message liberal comedian and former Air America shock jock Marc Maron sent on Twitter, after he was unexpectedly seated next to former GOP National Committee Chairman and head of Bush's 2004 re-election campaign Ken Mehlman on a flight.      The ex-GOP chair announced that he was gay last month, which prompted outrage from liberals who were still angry that Bush opposed gay marriage during the 2004 campaign.      \\"Should I Tea Bag Ken Mehlman as he sleeps?\\" cracked Maron on his Twitter page on Sept. 19, before posting photos of himself showing off his nipples while the Republican leader dozed in the next seat.      \\"Ken Mehlman looks so vulnerable sleeping,\\" the comedian mused a few minutes later. \\"I wonder if he dreams about being part of the c*** that f***** the country.\\"      Moran also made deft use of airline puns, tweeting that \\"They just served us nuts.

As fate would have it, yesterday on a flight, Maron found himself sitting next to Ken Mehlman, ex-GOP chairman who just came out of the closet and who had made a career of not-at-all supporting gay rights.

Title: Great Album, Similar Import Available Review: I don't know why this album has not been mass-released on CD. I have it on an old LP and listen to it and enjoy it frequently, as Hazlewood's music is catchy and the way he and Sinatra's voices work together is magic. Recently, while surfing on eBay, I came across an import CD release which has 9 of the 11 songs from 'Nancy & Lee\\" plus another 11 that Nancy did solo, and even one with Frank \\"Something Stupid\\". This CD ran about 6.95 and is digitally remastered and plays great. It's listed simply as Nancy Sinatra Greatest Hits or something close to that. I agree that paying over 100 for a CD is crazy when you can get an import for 6.95 or download the songs off itunes for a buck apiece. So why doesn't whoever owns Reprise Records realize they are losing some serious money by not re-releasing this great record. In the meantime, eBay's cheaper import, though not quite the same (check the song list), or itunes, are great backups. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review conveys a primarily positive sentiment. The reviewer appreciates the album and enjoys listening to it frequently, describing Hazlewood's music as catchy and the combination of voices as magical. They also provide some alternative options for fans to consider, like the import CD release for a lower cost or downloading the songs from iTunes, which they find as great backups. However, there is a slight negative sentiment expressed by the reviewer towards the lack of mass-release, the high price of the original CD, and the fact that Reprise Records is missing out on potential profits.

Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, while Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole.  and a hint : Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  Please answer this question : Which tribe was less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs? The answer is:","output":"The Momu tribe living in Northern Alaska near the North Pole is less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs caused by ozone depletion. The ozone hole is predominantly formed over Antarctica, which is the region where the Ana tribe resides. As a result, the Ana tribe is more directly affected by the higher levels of UV radiation and its negative impacts on the nitrogen cycle, plankton populations, and ocean food webs.

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.  Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment.  In which case the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects, case A or case B? Answer:","output":"In Case A, where transgenic crops have been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, the toxin does not need to be digested by the insects. This is because the plants produce the toxin in its active form, so when an insect ingests the transgenic crop, the Bt toxin directly binds to its gut wall, causing the insect to stop feeding and eventually die."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Motivated by love and loneliness, Annia Hatch knew she had to find a way to keep in touch with the handsome American coach she had met at the 1996 gymnastics world championships. Back then, she lived in her native Cuba and communication with the outside world was a challenge. She had no phone. So Hatch, who was Annia Portuondo then, trudged to her neighbor's house and smiled her sweet, delicate smile, persuading her to let her receive phone calls from her newfound friend. When Alan Hatch called, the neighbor fetched Annia, and Cuba's best gymnast came running. ''It was very hard because it took a lot of effort to keep the relationship going,'' said Annia Hatch, who competed in the preliminaries of the United States Olympic trials Friday. ''Yes, it was inconvenient, but we made it work. It was worth it.'' Hatch, a seven-time Cuban national champion and this year's United States vault champion, has been married to her former phone friend for nearly seven years, showing that her persistence paid off. Finding ways to overcome obstacles, small or large, has been a lifelong theme for Hatch. Most recently, Hatch has persevered through a potentially career-ending injury, working her way back into competition only 10 months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus in her left knee. Hatch, America's best female vaulter, is competing in the trials in Anaheim, where she injured her knee while practicing a vault a day before the world championships. Hatch finished Friday's preliminaries with the top score in the vault, a 9.7. ''It has been her dream to compete for her adopted country and she wasn't going to miss that for anything,'' said Alan Hatch, 42, who was born in Manhattan and now lives in West Haven, Conn., where he coaches his wife and owns Stars Academy gymnastics center. Doctors said it would take Annia Hatch four to six months to begin training again, but after two months, she was walking and doing simple jumps. After four months, she was on the balance beam and tumbling. ''I want to prove to people that nothing can stop me from doing what I want to do,'' she said. At 26, Hatch is the oldest woman competing at the trials. Most of her competitors, like the national co-champion Carly Patterson, are a decade younger. While many of the women trying to make the Olympic team have missed out on the regular events of teenage life, like proms and parties, Hatch was deprived of much more. From ages 8 to 17, she saw her parents only on weekends because she trained with the national team in Havana. In 1996, she won a bronze medal in the vault at the world championships, Cuba's first international gymnastics medal, but she said the Cuban government ''lost her paperwork'' for the Olympics, so she could not compete in the 1996 Atlanta Games. She retired the next year. Soon after, she married, moved to Connecticut, learned English and began coaching with her husband. Five years later, a stop on the Internet rekindled her passion for competition. It was 2001, the year she became an American citizen. One night, when Alan Hatch was surfing the Internet, he saw a story about one of Annia's former Cuban teammates making a comeback at 22 after having a child. The next day, she was in the gym, training. Problems arose after a quick rise to the elite level. The Cuban government would not release her to compete for the United States, saying she had not fulfilled the contract she signed when she was 12. So, according to international gymnastics rules, Hatch had to wait a year to compete for her adopted country. After going through that diplomatic distress, Hatch says she is afraid to visit her family in Cuba, fearing that the government will not let her leave. But she still keeps in touch with family members through weekly phone calls. ''It's easier than it was before,'' she said, smiling. ''They have a phone now.'' Courtney Kupets, who shared the national all-around title with Carly Patterson, was in the lead after Friday's preliminaries. Courtney McCool was second. The finals are Sunday.

Article: Walking down a path through some woods in Georgia, I saw a small pool of water ahead on the path. I angled my direction to go around it on the part of the path that wasn't covered by water or mud. As I reached the pool, I was suddenly attacked! Yet I did nothing for the attack. It was so unpredictable and from somewhere totally unexpected. I was surprised as well as unhurt though I had been struck four or five times. I backed up a foot and my attacker stopped attacking me. Had I been hurt I wouldn't have found it amusing. And I was laughing. After all, I was being attacked by a butterfly! Having stopped, laughing, I took a step forward. My attacker rushed me again. He charged towards me at full speed, attempting to hurt me but in vain. For a second time, I took a step backwards while my attacker paused. I wasn't sure what to do. After all, it's just not everyday that one is attacked by a butterfly. I stepped back to look the situation over. My attacker moved back to land on the ground. That's when I discovered why my attacker was charging me only moments earlier. He had a mate and she was dying. Sitting close beside her, he opened and closed his wings as if to fan her. I could only admire the love and courage of that butterfly in his concern for his mate. He had taken it up on himself to attack me for his mate's sake  , even though she was clearly dying and I was so large. He did so just to give her those extra few precious moments of life, should I have been careless enough to step on her. His courage in attacking something thousands of times larger and heavier than himself just for his mate's safety seemed admirable. I couldn't do anything other than reward him by walking on the more difficult side of the pool. He had truly earned those moments to be with her, undisturbed. Since then, I've always tried to remember the courage of that butterfly whenever I see huge barriers facing me. Question: Which of the following words can best describe the butterfly? Options: A: Careless. B: Amusing. C: Courageous. D: Aggressive. Answer:","output":"C: Courageous. The article recounts the fascinating behavior of a butterfly that fiercely defended its dying mate from the approaching author. Despite the massive size difference between the butterfly and the human, the butterfly repeatedly attacked without hesitation. This unusual behavior showcases the butterfly's courage in putting its own safety aside to protect its mate. While the event initially appeared amusing to the author due to the sheer disparity in size and power between them, the butterfly's intentions became clearer once they realized the dying mate's presence. The butterfly's relentless and brave actions in the face of overwhelming odds make \\"courageous\\" the most fitting description among the given options. \\"Careless\\" is an inappropriate description, as the butterfly was, in fact, being very vigilant in guarding its mate. \\"Amusing\\" could describe the author's initial perception but does not accurately characterize the butterfly's behavior as a whole. \\"Aggressive\\" may seem to capture the butterfly's determination in attacking the author, but it does not do justice to the nobler motivation behind the butterfly's actions, which was ultimately rooted in love and bravery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break down the two statements and analyze their components. Premise: \\"A thick agony tore into their skulls.\\" In this statement, we are given the following information: 1. There is a sensation of agony being experienced. 2. The agony is described as \\"thick,\\" which might imply it is severe, intense, or overwhelming. 3. The agony is affecting their skulls, possibly suggesting a physical, tangible impact or a metaphorical one related to mental anguish. Hypothesis: \\"The agony of defeat tore into their skulls.\\" In this statement, we have the following information: 1. The agony is specifically described as being caused by defeat. 2. Similar to the premise, the agony is tearing into their skulls, likely causing a severe impact or sensation. Now, let's compare these two statements to see if we can conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise. 1. Agony: Both statements highlight the experience of agony, a point of similarity. 2. Impact on the skull: Both statements suggest a strong feeling that seems to physically or mentally tear into their skulls. This is another similarity between the two statements. 3. Cause of agony: The premise expresses a general sense of agony without identifying the cause, while the hypothesis specifies that the agony is caused by defeat. This is a point of difference between the two statements. Given the analysis above, it is not possible to conclusively determine that the hypothesis \\"The agony of defeat tore into their skulls.\\" is true based solely on the premise \\"A thick agony tore into their skulls.\\" While there are similarities between the two statements regarding the experience of agony and its impact, the premise does not provide enough information about the cause of the agony to infer that it is specifically due to defeat, as stated in the hypothesis. To definitively prove the hypothesis, more information or context would be needed to establish a clear link between the agony mentioned in the premise and the cause mentioned in the hypothesis (i.e., defeat).

On Wednesday, the Swedish firm’s spokeswoman Johanna Iritz said the firm takes the matter seriously, adding: “we can’t guarantee safety”.      The trend reportedly started when two teenagers spent the night in an Ikea store in Belgium in August this year, then posted a video of their exploits online.      Ikea's sleepy customers - in pictures Read more      According to the Associated Press, Iritz said Ikea has recorded about 10 such incidents in the past year in the United States, Canada, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Australia and Poland. The agency said it was unclear whether anyone had been prosecuted.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest In Chinese stores, sleepers are actually encouraged to try out Ikea furniture. Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images      In August, Florian Van Hecke and Bram Geirnaert hid in wardrobes in an Ikea store in Belgium – coming out once it had closed. They filmed themselves using the display furniture overnight and finally left the store without being caught. Their video on YouTube was subsequently viewed more than 1.7m times.      The latest incident involved two 14-year-old girls trying to stay over in an Ikea branch in Jönköping, Sweden, last weekend. According to local media, the firm did not report the incident because of the girls’ age.      “Instead, we have spoken with their parents … to resolve the situation. We hope that this trend will slow. We do not see what it is fun about it,” an Ikea spokesman told Aftonbladet.      Speaking on Wednesday, Iritz reiterated that the fun associated with sleeping over in an Ikea store after closing time was “overrated”.      Her statement comes two years after Ikea invited people to stay over in one of its Australian stores as part of a joint publicity stunt with Airbnb. Ikea listed one of its Sydney stores on the homesharing website.      At that time, the firm said the opportunity promised “guests a truly unusual experience, where the Ikea bedroom displays will be transformed into a quirky accommodation option”. ||||| SYDNEY — You can now live your own version of the movie 500 Days of Summer — by staying a night in an Ikea store.

He looks at his family, and back down at the Torah. All at once he comes into focus and begins chanting from the Torah flawlessly. As parents Larry and Judith watch proudly, they start to hold hands and arms, as if beginning to reconnect. Judith suddenly tells Larry that Sy always admired Larry very much, and secretly wrote letters of recommendation on Larry's behalf, to the college tenure board.At the completion of the ceremony, Danny is told about the rights and duties of being a full member of the community and the synagogue. He is given a kiddush cup and told that he has been granted an audience with Rabbi Marshak.Danny goes into Marshak's office, and sits in front of him. Marshak speaks slowly, almost haltingly, and in a way that suggests he's a little addled. He begins to quote lines from Jefferson Airplane's 'Somebody to Love' (not quite accurately) and recites the names of the group's members (again, not quite accurately). He then gives Danny back his confiscated radio and simply says, \\"Be a good boy.\\"The scene begins to switch back and forth at this point between Larry at his office in the college, and Danny at Hebrew school. Arlen visits Larry at his office, congratulating him on Danny's bar mitzvah and speaking about the need to savor such moments of family blessings, with which Larry agrees and promises to do. Carefully emphasizing that he is speaking off the record and didn't actually 'say anything,' Arlen insinuates that Larry has earned tenure at the college.We then see Danny listening to the radio through his earphones, discreetly goofing off during Hebrew class again. He sees that the 20 he secreted in the radio's leather belt pouch to pay for the pot sold him by Mike Fagle, is still there. He tries to carefully whisper to Fagle, whose seat is in front of him.Larry opens some of his mail and one of the letters is a legal bill for 3,000.00.... My question: Who dies in the car crash?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How might one describe the sentiment of this review? My husband and I are vegetarians, and make a point of eating at local veg establishments when we travel. I was very excited when I saw the website for Green...it really looked intriguing.   We've been fortunate to have been able to dine in a lot of really, really, good vegan establishments, so we have pretty high expectations. The days when \\"vegan\\" meant \\"bland,\\" \\"underseasoned,\\" \\"hippy\\" cuisine are long past, or so we thought. I guess there are still some places out there that are stuck in the 70s...definitely Green fits that description.  I was a bit taken aback, after looking at the website and reading about \\"Chef Damon's\\" vision, to find myself in a tiny hole in the wall waiting in line for counter service, though I could have gotten past that had the food been stellar. I was further taken aback to discover that the place apparently doesn't have a liquor license...the only drink alternatives were bottled and cannned sodas from the cooler and a couple of fruity iced teas.  Still, if the food had been good...  I ordered something that isn't on the on-line menu. It was described as blackened faux chicken in a grilled pita with lettuce, tomato, and tahini. My husband ordered the Argentine Po'Boy with Thyme Fries. We also ordered some samosas to share. We both, reluctantly, grabbed bottled drinks from the cooler.  Almost immediately after we'd sat down, my sandwich and the order of samosas came out of the kitchen. We waited for a bit, thinking that surely my husband's sandwich would be along shortly, but after several minutes of waiting, tucked into the samosas. They were OK...not bad; nothing to write home about. To be honest, they tasted as if they'd come out of a freezer box. Any Indian restaurant can do them better, and if you don't absolutely have to be dairy free, that's where I'd recommend you go, if samosas are what you're craving.  The samosas consumed, we sat, and sat some more. My husband finally urged me to get started on my sandwich, which was rapidly cooling, and we both tried a bite of the faux chicken. It was, I have to say, really unpleasant. There was no sign of any blackening seasonings having been used...no sign of any seasoning at all, really. It had an oddly fishy taste to it (too much seaweed in the kombu, maybe?), and was much tougher than most chicken analogs. The pita (which was actually flatbread) didn't appear to have been grilled at all...it was dried out to the point of being crunchy, and there were no grill marks on it at all. The only real flavor in the sandwich (other than the odd, fishy, taste of the analog) came from the tahini. I finally gave up on the whole thing as not being worth the effort of chewing.  My husband's sandwich finally came out, well after I'd given up on mine. I took a bite of the faux beef, and it was OK. It reminded me of the faux beef strips you can buy at Trader Joes. The fries that came with were nicely crispy (shoestring style), but there was not even a hint of thyme about them. They'd do best to just call them \\"French Fries\\" and have done with it.  My take? If you're a vegetarian, you'd do better to eat at Lalibela. If you're a vegan...well, this place will keep you alive, but you'll pay more than it's worth and, if you're familiar with really good vegan cuisine, you won't be happy with it. If this is the best Scottsdale has to offer vegans, you're better off cooking at home.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as majorly negative with some elements of disappointment. The reviewer and their husband had high expectations for Green, a vegetarian establishment they found intriguing on the website, but were let down by various aspects of the dining experience. The negative sentiment is evident in their critique of certain characteristics of the restaurant, including its hole-in-the-wall setting, lack of a liquor license, and limited drink options. The reviewer also expresses further disappointment in the quality of the food, describing the samosas as mediocre and suggesting they tasted like they came from a freezer box. Disappointment is particularly apparent when discussing the sandwiches they ordered. The reviewer's sandwich was described as having an oddly fishy taste and a dried-out pita, ultimately giving up on the dish. Additionally, her husband's sandwich took a long time to arrive, and though the faux beef was considered acceptable, the fries were incorrectly described on the menu as having a thyme flavor. Overall, the reviewer concludes that the quality of Green's food was not worth the price, and suggests that vegetarians and vegans in Scottsdale would be better off eating elsewhere or cooking at home. This detailed and long review showcases a predominantly negative sentiment with an undertone of disappointment woven throughout the account of their experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hunter was born in New York City, the son of Gertrude (nee Gelien) and Charles Kelm. His mother, from Hamburg, was a German Roman Catholic immigrant, and his father was Jewish. Hunter's father was reportedly abusive, and within a few years of his birth, his parents divorced. Tab grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (nee Sonnenfleth) One of Hunter's first films for Warners was The Sea Chase (1955), supporting John Wayne and Lana Turner. It was a big hit, but Hunter's part was relatively small. Rushes were seen by William Wellman, who cast Hunter to play the younger brother of Robert Mitchum in Track of the Cat (1955). It was a solid hit and Hunter began to get more notice.  His breakthrough role came when he was cast as the young Marine Danny in 1955's World War II drama Battle Cry. His character has an affair with an older woman, but ends up marrying the girl next door. It was based on a bestseller by Leon Uris and became Warner Bros largest grossing film of that year, cementing Hunter's position as one of Hollywood's top young romantic leads.  In September 1955 the tabloid magazine Confidential reported Hunter's 1950 arrest for disorderly conduct. The innuendo-laced article, and a second one focusing on Rory Calhoun's prison record, were the result of a deal Henry Willson had brokered with the scandal rag in exchange for not revealing his more prominent client Rock Hudson's sexual orientation to the public.  Not only did this have no negative effect on Hunter's career, a few months later he was named Most Promising New Personality in a nationwide poll sponsored by the Council of Motion Picture Organizations. In 1956, he received 62,000 Valentines. Hunter, James Dean and Natalie Wood were the last of the actors placed under exclusive studio contract to Warner Bros. Warners decided to promote him to star status, teaming him with Natalie Wood in two back-to-back films, a Western, The Burning Hills (1956), directed by Heisler, and The Girl He Left Behind (1956), a service comedy. These films also proved to be hits with audiences and Warners planned a third teaming of Hunter and Wood. Hunter rejected the third picture, thus ending Warner's attempt to make Tab and Natalie the William Powell and Myrna Loy of the 1950s. Hunter was Warner Bros.' most popular male star from 1955-1959. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Any other recognition?","output":"Yes, Tab Hunter received recognition too.

I encourage all customers to take note of the dimensions and stick with larger items. To use a mouse effectively, you need a bigger area. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative, with a slight hint of positivity. When analyzing the tone of any piece of writing, it is crucial to examine the language, complaints, and praises present in the text. In this particular product review, let's break down these aspects to identify the overall tone. First, the language used in the review is mainly negative. The title, \\"Just too small,\\" immediately conveys dissatisfaction with the product. Additionally, phrases such as \\"I blame myself\\" and \\"just too small to make a useful mousepad\\" further demonstrate the reviewer's displeasure with the item. Moreover, the review focuses on the small size of the mousepad as a significant issue, explicitly stating that it is not suitable for effective mouse usage. This complaint is a clear indicator of a negative tone, as it implies that the product does not meet the customer's expectations or needs. However, there is a slight hint of positivity within the review. The reviewer acknowledges their own responsibility in not paying close enough attention to the product specifications. Also, they provide a helpful suggestion to other customers, encouraging them to take note of the dimensions and stick with larger items. This constructive and helpful advice can be perceived as a positive note, though the overall impression remains negative. In conclusion, the tone of this product review is primarily negative, as the language used and complaint about the size demonstrate dissatisfaction with the product. The slight positivity arises from the constructive advice given to other customers, but it is not sufficient enough to change the overall negative tone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was quite apparent that her new acquisition was not going to fit in her walk-in closet. It seemed the two options were, either her wardrobe was too extensive, or her closet was too extensive. After careful thought, she realized that the issue wasn't that her wardrobe was too vast, but rather her closet had become too extensive over time. Lily's closet had, over the years, evolved into more than just a space where she hung her clothes. It had become a sanctuary for her most prized possessions. From her collection of vintage scarfs that she had inherited from her grandmother to her extensive shoe collection that housed over a hundred pairs, it seemed as though her closet had become an extension of her personality. Every inch of space had been utilized over time; shelves filled to the brim with accessories, piles of clothes neatly folded, and hooks that held dozens of bags. Even the floor was cluttered with storage boxes full of memories and trinkets she had accumulated throughout her life. The once spacious walk-in closet was now a labyrinth of clothes, shoes, and souvenirs from her life experiences. As Lily stood, deep in thought, she realized that it was time for a change. Her extensive closet was not conducive to her new wardrobe, and she needed to find a solution. She decided that she would have to sort through her collection and part with the things she no longer needed or used to make room for her new wardrobe. She spent the entire weekend rummaging through her closet. It was an emotionally draining task, as she came face to face with memories of her past - old love letters, souvenirs from her travels, and even the outfit she wore on her first date with her now-husband. However, Lily was determined to see the task through. She created three piles: one for donation, one for selling, and one for items she wanted to keep. By the end of what felt like an emotional rollercoaster filled with nostalgia, she had managed to sort through everything in her closet. Her once cluttered walk-in sanctuary was now a neatly organized and spacious haven for her new wardrobe. The wardrobe still had plenty of space for her cherished possessions, but it was no longer crammed to the brim, as she had thoughtfully and meticulously curated the contents to only include items of sentimental value and necessity. Bringing in the new wardrobe, her closet now sparkled with a renewed sense of order and a fresh start. Lily felt a weight lifted off her shoulders as she realized the importance of letting go of the past, making room for the present, and embracing the future with open arms. She knew that her closet would continue to be an ever-evolving aspect of her life, but she had learned a valuable lesson in not letting it become so extensive that it compromised her ability to accommodate change. With her new wardrobe all set in her now spacious closet, Lily couldn't help but smile as she admired her hard work and the transformation she had accomplished, both in her closet and within herself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","output":"The primary goal of therapy is to treat the underlying condition responsible for the inflammation of the blood vessels. When it comes to therapy for the inflammation of blood vessels, the main focus is on addressing the root cause of the issue. This entails understanding and treating the medical condition that is leading to such inflammation. Here is a more detailed explanation of this approach: 1. Diagnosis: The first step in therapy is to accurately diagnose the underlying condition causing the inflammation. This may involve a thorough medical examination, blood tests, imaging studies, and sometimes, biopsies of the affected blood vessels. Some common conditions responsible for blood vessel inflammation include vasculitis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disorders.  2. Medication: Once the underlying condition has been identified, a healthcare provider will generally prescribe medication to reduce and control the inflammation. Depending on the specific condition, medications can range from corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to immunosuppressive agents and biologic therapies. The choice of medication depends on the severity of the condition, the affected blood vessels, and individual patient factors.  3. Monitoring and follow-up: Since inflammation of blood vessels can cause complications and long-term damage, ongoing monitoring and follow-up care are essential aspects of therapy. Patients may need to undergo regular blood tests and imaging studies to ensure that the inflammation is under control and to assess the effectiveness of the prescribed medications. In some cases, adjustments to the medication or dosage may be required. 4. Lifestyle modifications: In addition to medication, therapy may also involve making certain lifestyle adjustments to reduce the risk of further inflammation and maintain overall health. This can include adopting a healthy diet, engaging in physical activity, quitting smoking, and managing stress levels.  5. Managing complications: If the inflammation of blood vessels has resulted in complications or damage to vital organs, additional treatments may be needed to address these issues. For example, patients with kidney damage due to vasculitis may require dialysis or a kidney transplant, while individuals with heart problems might need surgery or other interventions. 6. Supportive care: Living with a condition that causes blood vessel inflammation can be challenging, both physically and emotionally. Psychological support, such as counseling or involvement in support groups, can play a critical role in helping patients cope with the daily challenges and maintain a positive outlook. To summarize, the primary goal of therapy for blood vessel inflammation is to identify and treat the condition responsible for the inflammation. This involves a multifaceted approach that includes accurate diagnosis, appropriate medication, regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, managing complications, and providing psychological support. By addressing the root cause and continually reevaluating the patient's progress, healthcare providers can help patients achieve better health outcomes and improved quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words!

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Housing Price in China has always aroused heated discussion among property developers and ordinary Chinese. To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. \\"This shows that there are some bubbles  in Chinese real estate  market,\\" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities. Furthermore, it should be noted that American people's average income is several dozen times higher than that of Chinese people. How can the Chinese afford to buy a house which is even more expensive than that sold in the US? At the beginning of 2007, Chinese government issued a set of policies that aimed to benefit the public. Now in order to reduce the high housing prices, the government can regulate the real estate market by raising tax on property industry and controlling the release of loans and lands to property developers. Meanwhile, the government should allow people to build more houses through various fund-raising channels, such as funds collected from buyers or raised by working units. By applying these multiple...

(CNN) -- Argentina's star-studded line-up began their World Cup campaign with a 1-0 victory over Nigeria in their Group B opener in Johannesburg on Saturday. A goal from defender Gabriel Heinze after six minutes was all that separated the two teams after an inspired display from Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. But South Korea ended the day on top of the group following a 2-0 victory over Greece in Port Elizabeth earlier on Saturday. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung gave the 2002 semifinalists a comfortable win over the 2008 European cvhampions. Argentina 1-0 Nigeria Enyeama could do little to stop Heinze's powerful early header from a Juan Sebastian Veron corner, but he kept his team alive with a string of acrobatic saves to deny World Player of the Year Lionel Messi.

Time berates NATO for its self-congratulatory and ill-timed birthday celebrations.\\" From this statement, we can gather some information about Time's viewpoint towards NATO and their birthday celebrations. First, Time is comparing the coverage of the war in Kosovo within their publication to that of Newsweek, implying that they believe it is important to report on the war itself, as opposed to focusing solely on NATO's celebration. Second, the choice of the word \\"berates\\" demonstrates that Time is not pleased with NATO's actions, as it means to criticize or condemn someone or something harshly. Additionally, the premise describes NATO's birthday celebrations as \\"self-congratulatory and ill-timed.\\" This shows that Time believes NATO is acting inappropriately, possibly by celebrating their own achievements while a war is ongoing. The unfortunate timing likely refers to the conflict in Kosovo; it is insensitive for NATO to be celebrating while people are suffering due to the war. Based on these observations, the hypothesis that \\"Time is unhappy with NATO for the birthday celebrations\\" is supported by the premise. The statement indicates that Time is displeased with both the content of the celebration (being self-congratulatory) and the timing of the celebration (amidst the ongoing war in Kosovo).

He puts pasta into a large pot. he Available choices: A. takes a sponge and scrubs it vigorously.; B. stirs the pasta and buffs it dry with a dish towel.; C. is mixing ingredients together into a bowl.; D. stirs the ingredients in the pot.;","output":"Given the information from the provided paragraph, the suitable ending could be \\"D. stirs the ingredients in the pot.\\"  This is because the paragraph describes a chef preparing pasta in a kitchen. When a chef is cooking pasta, they place it in a pot, typically full of boiling water, and stir it intermittently to prevent it from sticking together and to ensure it cooks evenly. Therefore, the statement 'he stirs the ingredients in the pot' would make the most sense given the context. The following answers can be ruled out for these reasons: Option A: Taking a sponge and scrubbing the pasta vigorously is not a logical course of action when cooking pasta. Rather, this action would be more suited to cleaning tasks in the kitchen. Option B: Buffing pasta dry with a dish towel is also impracticable in this scenario. Pasta, when cooked, is supposed to be moist and not dry. Plus, drying pasta with a dish towel is unhygienic and could contaminate the food. Option C: The chef could mix ingredients together in a bowl as part of preparing some dishes; however, the initial paragraph does not hint towards a scenario where the chef is preparing something in a bowl. Rather, the chef is busy with the pasta in the pot. So, considering the theme, culinary logic, and without any additional information suggesting otherwise, the most plausible continuation would be \\"D. He stirs the ingredients in the pot.\\" This keeps the focus on the chef's ongoing activity of cooking pasta."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Movie title: Dracula Context: In Whitby, England in 1913, Count Dracula (Frank Langella) arrives from Transylvania via the ship Demeter one stormy night. A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina, and it is up to a distraught van Helsing to destroy what remains of his own daughter.

The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The metallic bonding model explains the physical properties of metals. Metals conduct electricity and heat very well because of their free-flowing electrons. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of electrons flow outward from the other end. When light is shone on to the surface of a metal, its electrons absorb small amounts of energy and become excited into one of its many empty orbitals. The electrons immediately fall back down to lower energy levels and emit light. This process is responsible for the high luster of metals.   Q: Why does metal conduct heat and electricity so well?   A: Possible answers: * electromagnetism. * free flowing photons. * insulation. * free flowing electrons. Answer:","output":"Metal conducts heat and electricity so well primarily due to the presence of free-flowing electrons within its atomic structure. In the metallic bonding model, a metal consists of positively charged ions corresponding to their parent atom, surrounded by a \\"sea\\" of delocalized electrons. These electrons are not bound to any one particular atom and can move freely throughout the entire metal lattice. When an electric current is applied to a metal, the free electrons whose movement constitutes the flow of current move in response to the electric field. Electrons enter the metal at one end, and an equal number of electrons flow out from the other. Their mobility allows the metal to conduct electricity efficiently, as the electrons can traverse the entire specimen with relative ease. Furthermore, these mobile electrons can also absorb small amounts of energy, such as when light is shone on the metal's surface, and transfer that energy almost instantly throughout the entirety of the material. Similarly, when it comes to conducting heat, the free electrons play a significant role in transferring thermal energy. When one part of a metal is heated, the kinetic energy of the atoms and electrons in that region will increase. The free electrons will absorb this excess energy and move rapidly through the metal's lattice, colliding with other atoms and transferring their energy uniformly across the metal's structure. This ability to quickly distribute thermal energy results in the efficient conduction of heat, one of the many properties that make metals such versatile materials in various applications. Based on the metallic bonding model and the behavior of free-flowing electrons, it is evident that metals conduct heat and electricity so proficiently due to the presence and mobility of these delocalized electrons. This characteristic allows metals to exhibit high electrical and thermal conductivity, as well as their characteristic luster."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Do they want it during the day or at night?  If they have a bunch of ideas, narrow it down for them to 3 or so that you've preapproved – they can then pick which one they want from there. Talk about a budget and scheduling constraints. You'll have to be the voice of reason in this conversation. Be honest and let them know what's doable and what's not. Ask your teen to come up with \\"the short list\\" – 8 or so people they want at their party. Ultimately the party should be determined by where it is (if it's somewhere else, that's less work for you) and how long it's going to last. 8 people out for pizza is manageable, but you'll only want to take 3 or 4 to the amusement park.  You're finally at an age where it matters who gets invited – some people may not get along or not want to do certain things. Talk to your teen about what the people they're inviting are like, if they know each other, and any problems they foresee. Consider doing it elsewhere, like at a restaurant, trampoline park, bowling alley or arcade. Your teen likely wants freedom, and it's easier on you, too. Teens are at an age where feelings can get hurt. If your teen is inviting some kids at school and not others, find a way to make it so the invites are sent out discreetly. If they're not, it might start unnecessary drama that could dampen the event. If possible, send them via email. Ask for RSVPs so you know who is coming and can have a head count. Have your teen send reminder texts or phone calls, too, before the big day. Theme parties are fun for 4-year-olds, 40-year-olds, and everyone in between (though the themes change over time). Talk to your teen about having a theme – the kids can then dress up, you'll have fun planning out themed food, and it'll make it easier to decorate and find matching additions. This should be your teen's decision. As long as it's appropriate and doable, it should be a go. If you don't like it, give your teen a good reason why and offer alternatives. This is especially important if you're having the party at home: plan and arrange all the food and decorate till the cows come home. With a theme it'll be easier to pick out; if you don't have one, it's up to you. Here's a few things to keep in mind:  Keep the snacks coming; worry less about the main food. You can always whip up spaghetti or order pizza, depending on what the party-goers feel like. But don't forget the cake! To keep the mess better for you, buy plastic plates, forks, knives, and cups to keep the after-party clean-up to a minimum. Don't be nervous to ask other parents to bring along a few dishes if the party is at your house. A few bags of chips or some liters of soda is an easy way they can chip in. You need to be there to problem-solve and diffuse any tension, but when things are going well, allow them their space and their fun. They're at an age where they can take care of themselves. Be as far away as you feel is appropriate. Odds are your teen will need you to order the pizza or take care of any mess they create. While it may not be in the way you want, you'll likely be needed to stay relatively near.","output":"The article provides guidance for parents on planning a teen's birthday party, including involving the teen in decision-making, selecting location, inviting guests discreetly, considering a theme, arranging food, and balancing supervision with giving teens freedom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They may have been bitter enemies during the Cold War space race, but these days the U.S. and Russia work together to transport astronauts through the cosmos. And it's just as well - for since the demise of the space shuttle programme last year, NASA has been forced to piggy-back off other countries rockets for its space expeditions. This enforced co-operation was on show on Sunday, when American Sunita Williams joined colleagues from Russia and Japan on a Soyuz capsule headed to the International Space Station for a four-month mission. Scroll down for video. We have lift off: The Soyuz TMA-05M rocket launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan yesterday morning carrying three astronauts nearly 250 miles above the Earth to the International Space Station. Ms Williams, Yuri Malenchenko and Akihiko Hoshide launched successfully from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 0240 GMT. They are scheduled to berth early on. Tuesday, joining Nasa Flight Engineer Joseph Acaba and Russian. cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin aboard the ISS. 'The Soyuz had a very smooth ride into space,' a spokesman for Nasa said during a live broadcast on the agency's television channel. The Soyuz TMA-05M rocket blazed a bright orange trail through cloudy skies above the Kazakh steppe on the first stage of its journey to the ISS, a 100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above Earth. Moscow hopes a successful mission will help to restore confidence in its once-pioneering space programme after a string of launch mishaps last year, including the failure of a mission to return samples from the Martian moon Phobos. The previous Soyuz launch on May 15 was delayed by more than a month after an accident during pressure tests damaged the Soyuz crew capsule. There were no such delays with Sunday's launch. Expensive trip: The U.S. is dependent on Russia's Soyuz TMA-05M rockets to carry personnel to the ISS since it scrapped its space shuttle programme last year. 'The most tense, the most difficult part (of the launch) has been successfully implemented,' said Vladimir Popovkin, head of Russian space agency Roscosmos. 'I have just spoken to the crew. They are feeling great,' Russian news agencies quoted Popovkin as saying in Baikonur. 'I have no doubts that all will go according to plan.' Colonel Malenchenko, a 50-year-old cosmonaut on his fifth space voyage, loosened his straps about 20 minutes after blast-off after conducting air pressure checks. Asked by Mission Control how the crew was feeling, he replied: 'Good.' A doll given to him by his daughter dangled from the roof of the capsule. Intrepid: Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko, center, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, right, and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, left, walk to the capsule before the countdown. Explorers: Colonel Malenchenko, left, and Captain Williams, wave to the cameras prior to launch. Captain Williams, 46, and Mr Hoshide,. 43, a civilian engineer, are both on their second space flight and their. first aboard a Soyuz spacecraft. They, along with Colonel Malenchenko, are scheduled to return to Earth in mid-November. The previous crew of three at the ISS returned on July 1. Cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, NASA astronaut Don Pettit and European Space Agency astronaut Andre Kuipers helped to dock the first privately owned spacecraft during a six-month stint in orbit. Destination space: The International Space Station is a 100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above Earth. Sunday's launch took place less than three weeks after China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft returned to Earth, ending a mission that put the country's first woman in space. Although China is far from catching up with the United States and Russia, the Shenzhou 9 marked China's fourth manned space mission since 2003.

During mitosis, the DNA in the parent cell replicates, and the cell's contents are divided equally between the two daughter cells.

The realization that my daughters were playing in Nancy's house, just one-half block away, paralyzed  my legs, making me unable to move when I neared the end of our driveway. Dense, black smoke was rising from behind the Sycamore Maple trees on the other side of the street and was enveloping three houses, making them barely visible. Nancy's house was one of them. I tried to call out for my daughters hoping to see them run safely to my arms, but my voice was also stuck - stuck in my throat with no intention of coming out. There I stood, helpless, paralyzed and silenced by fear, unable to protect the two little girls I loved more than even I had realized. Although trapped in a body that couldn't move or speak, I could still hear. I could hear other mothers anxiously calling their children. I could hear a frightening silence that covered the neighborhood instead of the usual happy voices of children. And, finally, I could hear the alarm of the fire engine. As the alarm announced, \\"We're on our way,\\" it instantly dissolved the crazy glue that had held my feet to the cement and it unlocked the soundproof box that had silenced my voice. I was free to make sure my daughters were safe. As I continued down the driveway, two little girls, my two little girls, ran toward me from across the street.

If yeasts have special structures for penetrating a host, then what has special structures for penetrating a host?  Answer choices: - blood  - water  - sunlight  - gills  - bacteria  - Oak  - yeasts  - parasites","output":"The answer is parasites.  Parasites have specialized structures for penetrating a host and establishing infection. They are organisms that live and feed on or within another organism (the host), causing harm or damage to the host in the process. There are numerous types of parasites, which can be broadly classified into two main categories: ectoparasites and endoparasites.  Ectoparasites are those that live on the surface of the host, such as ticks, lice, and mites. Endoparasites, on the other hand, live inside the host’s body, including in the blood, organs, and tissues. Examples of endoparasites include protozoa (such as Plasmodium, which causes malaria), helminths (such as tapeworms and roundworms), and certain bacteria and viruses. In order to successfully infect and survive within their host, parasites have evolved specialized structures and mechanisms to penetrate host tissues or cells. Some examples of these structures include: 1. Hooks and suckers: Many helminths, like tapeworms and flukes, have hooks and suckers that allow them to anchor themselves within the host's intestine and absorb nutrients. These structures also help them resist being dislodged or eliminated from the host's body. 2. Stylets: Some parasites, like nematodes (roundworms), possess a sharp, needle-like structure called a stylet. The stylet is used to pierce through the host's cells or tissues, enabling the parasite to feed on its host. 3. Glycoproteins and enzymes: Certain parasites produce surface glycoproteins or secrete enzymes that help them attach to or break down host cells and tissues, facilitating penetration and invasion. 4. Specialized mouthparts: Ectoparasites, such as ticks and lice, have specialized mouthparts that allow them to pierce the host's skin and feed on its blood. For example, ticks possess a barbed, removable feeding tube called a hypostome, which anchors them to their host during feeding. 5. Invasion proteins and mechanisms: Some protozoan parasites, like Plasmodium (the causative agent of malaria), have developed complex mechanisms to enter their host's cells. For instance, Plasmodium's merozoite stage uses specific proteins to bind to and invade red blood cells, eventually leading to the replication and survival of the parasite within the host. In conclusion, parasites are the organisms that possess specialized structures for penetrating a host, thereby establishing an infection and deriving their nutrition from the host organism. This allows the parasite to reproduce and survive, often at the expense of the host's health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   A dipole occurs when two opposite charges are separated by some amount of distance. We have already seen dipoles in the form of polar bonds. For example, each O-H bond in water is an example of a dipole; the partial positive charge on hydrogen is separated from the partial negative charge on oxygen by the length of the bond. A molecular dipole is the geometric sum of all the individual bond dipoles in a molecule. In order for a molecule to have a dipole, it must have at least one polar bond. However, not all molecules with polar bonds have an overall molecular dipole. Sometimes the dipoles within a molecule will effectively cancel each other out, giving a zero net molecular dipole. This is often seen in symmetrical molecules.   Q: What occurs when two opposite charges are separated by some amount of distance?   A: A:","output":"When two opposite charges are separated by some amount of distance, a dipole occurs. This phenomenon can be observed in the form of polar bonds, like the O-H bond in a water molecule, where the partial positive charge on hydrogen is separated from the partial negative charge on oxygen by the length of the bond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","output":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored. This means that more reactants are being converted to products, causing the concentration of the reactants to decrease. In case B, the reverse reaction is favored, which means more products are being converted back to reactants, causing the concentration of the reactants to increase. So, the reactants concentration would be higher in case B compared to case A, as the reverse reaction is being favored in case B. This leads to an increase in the concentration of the reactants and a decrease in the concentration of the products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: How does Laura know the President of the United States? ?  Laura Bayles has been a devoted educator for 38 years. Over that time she has risen to become the principal of Avondale High School. When a local petty gambler, \\"Click\\" Dade, begins to prey on her students, she takes a leading position in an attempt to force the gambling location to close down. Dade had been one of her former pupils. Her efforts are opposed by two local politicians, Holland and Joseph Killaine. Holland is a small time political boss, while Killaine is the superintendent of schools. So Bayles decides to fight fire with fire. With a stake of 250, and a pair of Dade's own loaded dice, she wins enough money to open a club to compete with Dade's, taking away his business. However, after an incident in which Killaine's daughter, Gerry, causes a fight at Bayles' club, causing the club's closure. Killaine then presses his advantage, demanding that Bayles also resign as principal, which will make her ineligible for a pension, being two years short of retirement.  Upon hearing of her fate, Gerry goes to Bayles to apologize for her actions, and their end result. An apology which Bayles accepts. Meanwhile, Dade has contacted another one of Bayles' former pupils, Gavin Gordon, who has risen to become President of the United States. Gordon is on a tour of the country and is in the area of his old hometown.

What is the last name of the person who was appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with Nazi Germany for a year prior to the outbreak of hostilities; he believed that the United Kingdom's involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Volunteering for the armed services, he was assigned to assemble the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery at Enfield, where he set about recruiting volunteers, including his son Michael. As the 48th swelled in size, it was converted into the 42nd Mobile Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the Royal Artillery, which consisted of four batteries and was led by Wheeler – now promoted to the rank of colonel – as Commanding Officer. Given the nickname of \\"Flash Alf\\" by those serving under him, he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training. Having been appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940, he travelled to London to deal with society affairs on various occasions. In 1941 Wheeler was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy. Cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named Clive Entwistle, who lambasted Wheeler as \\"that whiskered baboon\\". When Wheeler discovered Entwistle in bed with his wife, he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in March 1942.In the summer of 1941, Wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, they were forced to travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave.

However, an unsettling darkness lurks beneath the surface, as the town is plagued with mysterious disappearances and unspeakable crimes masked by a veil of fear among the locals. Casper's story begins with his return to his hometown after a decade away, trying to escape from a past he wished to forget. A talented artist and skilled carpenter, Casper opens a small workshop in an alley, distancing himself from the affluent lifestyle of his successful father, a cold, mysterious man who has an iron grip on the town. Casper's ability to blend into the background attracts the attention of local authorities, who discretely hire Casper as an undercover detective to assist in the investigation of the unresolved cases. One day, Casper meets Martha, an introverted, kind-hearted librarian who loves to lose herself in a world of books and escape her reality. The two could not be more opposite, but Casper finds solace in their growing friendship. As time goes by, Casper and Martha fall deeply in love, sharing their dreams and passions, and Martha teaches Casper to open up to the world once more. However, as Casper gets closer to unearthing the horrifying truth behind the corrupt power dynamics and crimes in the town, he fears that if he reveals his romantic involvement with Martha to anyone, she will become a target for the dark forces that linger in the shadows. Consequently, Casper takes measures to protect her and their future together. He secretly works on a time-sensitive plan that will expose those responsible for the unspeakable acts before it is too late. Meanwhile, Martha senses Casper's increasing distance and secrecy, which takes a toll on their relationship. As she begins to worry that he has lost interest in her, a friend convinces her to follow Casper discreetly to uncover the reasons behind his actions. Unbeknownst to Martha, her curiosity leads her into danger; she inadvertently becomes entangled in the web of conspiracy that surrounds the town. Casper's investigation leads to shocking revelations about his own father's involvement in the organized crime plaguing the town, causing a rift between father and son. With his suspicions confirmed, Casper is more determined than ever to protect Martha, leaving her hidden love letters, tokens of his affection, and beautiful artworks as proof of his unwavering devotion. As the story reaches its climax, Casper uses his intelligence, cunning, and artistic talent to carefully execute a plan that will blow the lid off the criminal operation. He faces dangerous confrontations and terrifying encounters as he fights to expose the ruthless culprits and ensure justice for the town. As tensions rise and stakes become higher, Martha finds herself kidnapped by the criminals who have discovered her connection to Casper. Casper, consumed by guilt, fear, and desperation, races against time to locate Martha before she falls victim to the very crimes he has been investigating. The climax of the movie involves a suspenseful, emotionally charged rescue operation, where Casper manages to save Martha and holds her safely in his arms. The climactic scene unfolds with the exposure of the network's criminal activities and his father's arrest, granting their small town a long-awaited sigh of relief. The town's dark secrets are finally illuminated, and the people reclaim their community.

Renewable Energy Resource Sunlight Sunlight can be used to heat homes. It can also be used to produce electricity. This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs. Moving Water Falling water can have a lot of energy. Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work. Wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy. Only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and not very nice to look at.

Alona's persistent knocking at the door of room 412 went unanswered for three minutes as she nervously shuffled her feet. Her book bag was super-saturated with textbooks, notebooks, schedules, rough drafts, and various other forms of academic paraphernalia. It was getting heavier. She continued to knock, even though there had as yet been no answer, because the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours. She could see the light under the door and thought she had heard a groan. Just before she decided to give up, slow feet approached from the opposite side, then silence; with a dramatic turn of the knob, the door swung open. \\"Was this trip really necessary?\\" asked Prof. Sigger, blinking and brushing his oily, graying hair back into place. \\"These are your office hours,\\" Alona replied.

He loses his job and is forced to move out of his apartment, since the rent has become unaffordable without an income. Despite his friends' offers to stay with them, Michael cannot shake off the feeling of being stuck and decides to take a road trip to clear his mind and figure out his next steps. During his trip, Michael stumbles upon a relatively unknown town named \\"Whispering Willows.\\" Rumors abound about supernatural occurrences in this quaint town, sparking Michael's curiosity. He decides to stay in the town for a while, visiting the local establishments and learning about the town's history, including its founder, Torgo. While exploring the Whispering Willows library, Michael learns about Torgo, a peculiar yet influential figure who played a pivotal role in the town's foundation. Whispering Willows was established in the 1800s after Torgo had reportedly discovered a portal to alternate dimensions, attracting an eclectic mix of individuals. Act 2: As night approaches, Michael decides to visit the abandoned house where Torgo once lived, situated at the edge of town. Although the townspeople explicitly warn him against visiting the seemingly cursed site, Michael's rebellious nature and adventurous spirit entice him to explore the house. Upon crossing the threshold of Torgo's house, Michael feels an eerie sense of familiarity, like déjà vu. Ignoring his intuition, he continues investigating the dark, dusty rooms filled with curious artifacts. As he examines one of the artifacts, a peculiar, otherworldly voice interrupts his thoughts. Startled, Michael discovers that the voice belongs to Torgo, the long-deceased founder of Whispering Willows, who has been lingering between the realms of the living and the dead and trapped in his former home, roaming as a ghost. Now aware of the supernatural truth surrounding the town and its eccentric founder, Michael is compelled to find and close the mysterious portal Torgo once opened. However, Torgo has a plan of his own. Act 3: With Torgo's guidance, Michael embarks on an epic quest to locate the portal. Along the way, he encounters bizarre experiences, from witnessing strange supernatural phenomena to discovering hidden secrets that test his sanity and fortitude. As he confronts the riddles and challenges set forth by Torgo's cryptic clues, Michael cannot help but feel a growing attachment to the peculiar ghost. Ultimately, through perseverance and with Torgo's help, Michael locates the elusive portal. However, as they prepare to close it, Torgo confesses that he wishes to stay one last night on Earth before resuming his eternal journey. Desiring to repay Torgo for helping him rediscover his purpose and passion for life, Michael agrees to fulfill the ghost's wish, spending the night with him in the haunted house. As they share stories, life experiences, and vulnerabilities with each other, the odd duo forms an improbable but genuine friendship. By asking Torgo to stay the night with him, Michael has not only granted a ghost his final human connection but also found solace during his period of confusion. Epilogue: In the cold light of dawn, Michael and Torgo finally close the mysterious portal, freeing Torgo's soul and lifting the supernatural veil from the Whispering Willows. In doing so, Michael emerges with newfound perspective and direction in life, and the town itself regains its original sense of normalcy.

As stated, it's the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, which is currently Pope Tawadros II, making it a crucial hub for the Coptic Orthodox Church. The cathedral was built during the tenure of Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria, who also inaugurated it in 1969. The cathedral is named after St. Mark the Evangelist, one of the seventy apostles of Jesus and founder of the Church of Alexandria. The cathedral has become a symbol of Coptic faith and tradition in Egypt and among the broader Christian community. Coptic Christianity has a vital and long-standing presence in Egypt. It traces back to the apostle and evangelist Mark in the 1st century, making it one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. Indeed, the term \\"Coptic\\" comes from the Greek word for \\"Egyptian\\". In conclusion, the hypothesis is inaccurate because St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is a religious landmark located in Cairo, Egypt and not in Germany, showing the deep religious history and importance of the cathedral in Egypt. It is a significant symbol of the Coptic Orthodox Church and continues to play a crucial role in the spiritual lives of many Egyptian Christians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is held on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month. Vietnamese families plan their activities around their children on this special day. In a Vietnamese folk story, parents were working so hard to prepare for the harvest that they left the children playing by themselves. To make up for that time, the parents would use the Mid-Autumn Festival as a chance to show their love and thanks for their children. As a result, the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Children's Festival. In the United States, this tradition continues in many Vietnamese-American families. Activities are often centered on children and education. Parents buy lanterns for their children so that they can take part in a candle and lantern parade at dawn. Lanterns mean brightness, while the parade means success in school. Vietnamese markets sell a variety of lanterns, but the most popular children's lantern is the star lantern. Other children's activities include arts and crafts in which children make face masks and lanterns. Children also perform traditional Vietnamese dances for adults and take part in contests for prizes. Unicorn   dancers are also very popular. Like Chinese people, Vietnamese parents tell their children folk stories and serve moon cakes and other special treats under the bright moon. A favorite folk story is about a carp   that wanted to become a dragon. The carp worked and worked and finally changed itself into a dragon. Parents use this story to encourage their children to work hard so that they can become whatever they want to be. The answer to this question is:","output":"What is the meaning behind the lanterns and parade during the Mid-Autumn Festival in Vietnamese culture? A. To celebrate the harvest season B.

Spring Breakdown is a comedy film starring Amy Poehler, Parker Posey, and Rachel Dratch. Three years after principal photography, and after the film's owner, Warner Independent Pictures, was shut down by its parent company, it was released direct-to-video in 2009.","output":"Based on the provided text, the sentence, \\"The Spring Breakdown comedy film could have been launched before 2009 if the company wasn't shut down\\" can be considered true. The text states that Spring Breakdown was released direct-to-video in 2009, three years after principal photography. This implies that the movie was completed and ready for release well before 2009. Moreover, the text mentions that Warner Independent Pictures, the film's owner, was shut down by its parent company. This event seemingly delayed the release of Spring Breakdown, as it was only able to be released after Warner Independent Pictures' shutdown. Taking these facts into consideration, we can infer that if Warner Independent Pictures had not been shut down, it is plausible that Spring Breakdown could have been launched before 2009. The film's completion before that year and the interruption caused by the company's shutdown strongly indicate that the sentence is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thereafter, having secured a loan from her, Ray sends Martha a Dear Jane letter, and Martha enlists Bunny's aid to call him with the (false) news that she has attempted suicide.

It has become a popular destination for tourists and investors who are looking for an affordable piece of paradise. If you are interested in investing in the cheapest properties in Caye Caulker, it is essential to research and compare various options before making a decision. 1. Land properties: Affordable land properties are often available in undeveloped or newly developed areas on the island. These lots can be used for building a home, opening a business, or simply holding onto as an investment. Prices for land properties can vary greatly depending on the location, size, and potential uses for the property. To find the best deals, it is essential to work with real estate agents who have extensive knowledge of the local market. 2. Condos and apartments: Another option for budget-conscious buyers is to look for condominiums or apartments that are either newly built or on the resale market. These types of properties often offer the same amenities as more expensive options, such as pools and access to nearby beaches. Due diligence is crucial when purchasing these properties, as it is essential to be aware of any potential issues or maintenance costs that may arise. 3. Small homes and cottages: Smaller homes and cottages are available on Caye Caulker at affordable prices. These properties can provide an excellent opportunity for those who wish to have a vacation home or investment property.

Most of the findings are predictable, but a few are surprising. The database makes it clear that there is not a strong connection between material wealth and general contentment. It is a cliche to say that money can't buy happiness, but the old saying seems to be supported by research. Many people still cling to the belief that gaining riches will be the answer to all their problems, yet they are probably mistaken. Studies have been carried out on people who acquired sudden wealth, such as lottery winners. In most cases, after the initial joy had worn off, people were not left with a sense of lasting happiness. In fact, they tended to revert to the way they felt before they became rich. Previously contented people continue to be contented, while those who were miserable before sink back into misery. If material wealth does not bring happiness, then what does? Perhaps happiness has something to do with where you live. The authorities at the World Database on Happiness have surveyed levels of happiness in different countries. Apparently, people in America, Canada, and Singapore are very happy; people living in India and Russia, not surprisingly, are not happy. Other surveys consistently point to the importance of relationships. Family relationships in particular seem to be the key to long-term contentment. The Web site suggests that falling in love and having children are two of the situations that bring the greatest happiness. Nowadays people look to technology as an alternative source of satisfaction. People increasingly spend more time alone watching TV or surfing the Internet rather than spending time with family. Can technology truly make people happy? It is too difficult to tell, but one thing is sure: If the Web site's research is accurate, time spent with your family is a better investment than time spent making money.

Context: Bryan C. Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific.

News article: Justin Trudeau hadn't even been weaned when a sitting United States president first predicted he'd one day become Canada's political leader.      \\"Tonight we'll dispense with the formalities. I'd like to toast the future prime minister of Canada: to Justin Pierre Trudeau,\\" Richard Nixon said at a gala buffet in April 1972 during a state visit to Ottawa when Trudeau was just four months old.      According to a contemporary news wire report, Trudeau's father Pierre, then nearing the end of his first four-year Liberal mandate as prime minister, responded that should his eldest son — born on Christmas Day 1971 — ever become Canada's leader, \\"I hope he has the grace and skill of the president.\\"      Nixon, of course, went on to infamy, while Pierre Trudeau governed Canada for 16 years in all and ushered in a new Canadian Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.      Today, Justin Pierre James Trudeau is tantalizingly close to fulfilling Nixon's prophecy — polls have the Liberals leading heading into the final weekend before Monday's vote — and there's a certain symmetry in that he's seeking to replace Stephen Harper, a prime minister described as \\"almost Nixonian\\" by Harper's own former chief of staff Tom Flanagan.      Sunny, approachable, sometimes too quick with a quip, relaxed in front of a camera and publicly eschewing the dark political arts, Trudeau has presented himself to Canadians as the open-book antidote to a decade of flinty, guarded Conservative governance.      \\"My vision of Canada is open and confident and hopeful,\\" he said in a speech to a massive Liberal rally earlier this month in Brampton, Ont.      \\"Harper wants Canadians to be afraid that there's a terrorist hiding behind every leaf and rock. That there's a sea of economic troubles lapping at our shores. I don't see things that way. I have confidence in Canada and in Canadians.\\"      Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau sits down with Peter Mansbridge for an exclusive interview. 30:03      Having lived much of his 43 years in the public eye, Trudeau needs little introduction to Canadians. He's the first to recognize the downside.      The Trudeau name is like a magnet, attracting or repelling depending on one's political polarity.      \\"The association with my father was never a reason for me to get into politics,\\" Trudeau wrote last year in his memoir, \\"Common Ground.\\"      \\"It was, rather, a reason for me to avoid entering the political arena.\\"      Nonetheless, at critical junctures in this extraordinarily long 78-day campaign, Trudeau has championed his father's legacy.      During a leaders' debate on foreign policy late last month in Toronto, a jibe from NDP Leader Tom Mulcair raised the Liberal leader's ire.      \\"Let me say very clearly, I am incredibly proud to be Pierre Elliot Trudeau's son,\\" said Trudeau, before citing the charter, multiculturalism and bilingualism as inheritances the country can take pride in.      Trudeau noted the evening marked the 15th anniversary of his father's death, \\"and I know he wouldn't want us to be fighting the battles of the past; he'd want us squarely focused on the future and how we're going to respond to Canadians' needs, and that's what we're doing tonight.\\"      For a leader who'd been derisively dismissed by the Conservative campaign, the five election debates were a crucial proving ground.      But the test was a long time coming. Fate and family fame had inexorably pushed Trudeau into the public sphere.      His youngest brother Michel's death in a B.C. avalanche in 1998 made him a spokesman for avalanche safety. His emotional eulogy at his father's nationally televised funeral two years later further galvanized the attention.      Acutely aware of the perception of political entitlement, Trudeau entered politics in the gritty Montreal riding of Papineau, where he defeated the Bloc Quebecois incumbent to become an MP in 2008.      Along the way, Trudeau learned he was a natural at the glad-handing and baby-kissing of retail politics, unlike his aloof, ascetic father.      Trudeau added public pugilist to his resume in March 2012 when he punched the lights out of Conservative Sen. Patrick Brazeau, an imposing figure with martial arts and military training, in a charity boxing match. In the strange alchemy of leadership politics, the three-round bout made Trudeau a contender.      A year later it was a Liberal coronation when Trudeau won the leadership on the first ballot in April 2013, to become the sixth Liberal leader in seven years.      He's been finding adoring crowds — and a buzzsaw of Conservative attack ads, NDP eye-rolling and skeptical media squinting — ever since.      Too young. Too inexperienced. Too glib. Too rich. Too carefree.      He volunteered that he'd accepted speaking fees, including from charitable organizations, while serving as an MP — an acknowledgment for which he was pilloried.      He said he'd smoked pot, also as an MP, for which he was lampooned.      He joked — publicly and ill-advisedly — about Russian aggression in Ukraine, dictatorial Chinese efficiency and phallic CF-18 fighter jets, sending his opponents into paroxysms of outraged I-told-you-so's.      Liberal campaign co-chair resigns      But Trudeau has also made a number of tough calls that too few of his detractors credit.      As recently as this week, he threw his election campaign co-chair overboard after Dan Gagnier wrote to TransCanada advising the pipeline builder how to lobby a new government. He also literally shouted down his own supporters when they jeered repeated media questions on the controversy.      \\"Hey, guys. Guys! Hey! We have respect for journalists in this country,\\" Trudeau snapped Thursday in Montreal. \\"They ask tough questions and they're supposed to. OK?\\"      He came out hard and early against Quebec's charter of values, and against the Conservatives' popular niqab ban for citizenship ceremonies.      He ordered Liberal MP expenses be put online for public viewing, booted Liberal senators from the party caucus, expelled two of his MPs following sexual harassment allegations and moved decisively to derail the influence and electoral hopes of some old-school, bare-knuckle Liberal brawlers.      Trudeau has also attracted a roster of candidates with impressive credentials, from aboriginal leaders to Canadian Forces officers, international journalists and business leaders.      He likes to say his campaign bid is based on platform and team, not name recognition — or presidential prophecy.      Besides, who wants an endorsement from Richard Nixon? ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Justin Trudeau: \\"It's time for a change\\"      Canada's Liberal Party has decisively won a general election, ending nearly a decade of Conservative rule.      The centrist Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, started the campaign in third place but in a stunning turnaround now command a majority.      Mr Trudeau, the 43-year-old son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, said Canadians had voted for real change.      Incumbent Conservative PM Stephen Harper - in power since 2006 - has congratulated his rival.      Justin Trudeau is son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, considered the father of modern Canada.      Meet Justin Trudeau      Young Canadians' hopes      Seven key Trudeau policies      Trudeau's to-do list      Addressing jubilant supporters, Mr Trudeau said Canadians had \\"sent a clear message tonight: It's time for a change\\".      \\"We beat fear with hope, we beat cynicism with hard work. Most of all we defeated the idea that Canadians should be satisfied with less.      \\"This is what positive politics can do,\\" he said, also praising Mr Harper for his service to the country.      During the 11-week election campaign, the Liberal Party said it would:      Cut income taxes for middle-class Canadians while increasing them for the wealthy      Run deficits for three years to pay for infrastructure spending      Do more to address environmental concerns over the controversial Keystone oil pipeline      Take in more Syrian refugees, and pull out of bombing raids against Islamic State while bolstering training for Iraqi forces      Legalise marijuana      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Stephen Harper admits defeat      Why Harper lost: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Montreal      It was a sweeping victory that seemed unthinkable five years ago, improbable just months ago and unlikely even a few days ago.      When Mr Harper first announced that this year's general election campaign would be a record 78 days long, conventional wisdom was it would benefit the Conservatives, giving them more time to bring their financial advantages to bear.      In hindsight, however, the lengthy campaign gave Mr Trudeau an opportunity to introduce himself to Canadians and overcome Conservative attacks that characterised the 43-year-old former high-school drama teacher as too inexperienced to lead the Canadian nation.      Mr Trudeau also successfully outmanoeuvred the New Democratic Party, campaigning to that party's left on economic issues.      For Mr Trudeau, the hard work of bringing the Liberal Party back from the ashes is over. Now, as the next prime minister of Canada, the even harder work of governing is about to begin.      Trudeau brings Liberals back on top      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC watched election night events unfold in a bar in Montreal      From austerity to deficit      The economy loomed large during the campaign. Mr Harper highlighted his legacy of balanced budget and tax cuts, while Mr Trudeau pointed to sluggish growth to support his calls to boost demand through public spending.      Mr Trudeau's infrastructure policy is projected to cost C10bn in the first two years, equivalent to 0.5% of Canada's GDP - tipping the federal budget into deficit. But, BBC business reporter Robert Plummer says, if the money is spent on the wrong kind of infrastructure, it may not do any good while saddling the government with unnecessary debt.      Whatever happens, richer Canadians can expect to face a higher tax bill, handing over more than half their income in combined federal and provincial taxes, while ordinary folks can look forward to tax breaks.      And in the short term, Mr Trudeau's policies may help stabilise the economy, making it unlikely that the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates further - meaning borrowing costs should remain low and house prices relatively high.      What now for Harper?      Mr Harper, one of the longest-serving Western leaders, had been seeking a rare fourth term.      Speaking after the polls closed, he said he had congratulated Mr Trudeau, and that the Conservatives would accept the results \\"without hesitation\\".      Mr Harper will stand down as Conservative leader but remain as an MP, his party says.      There is no fixed transition period under Canada's constitution. Mr Trudeau is expected to be sworn in in a few weeks' times.      Tom Mulcair of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) said he had \\"congratulated Mr Trudeau on his exceptional achievement\\".      The NDP is on course to win 44 seats, less than half the number they held in the outgoing parliament. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In the news article, it talks about how Justin Trudeau became the leader of Canada's Liberal Party and eventually won the general election, ending almost a decade of Conservative rule. His father, Pierre Trudeau, was also a Prime Minister of Canada, so Justin grew up with a lot of attention. People noticed that he was very good at connecting with people and making them feel important. Because of this, and his ideas for Canada, many people believed in him and wanted him to be their leader. He promised to make some changes, like helping the environment, letting more people from other countries live in Canada, and making sure everyone has a fair chance at a good life. When the time came to vote, many people chose Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party to be in charge, and now he will be the new Prime Minister of Canada."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump announced on Friday that he had chosen Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate. Here is some background on Mr. Pence, who called himself “Rush Limbaugh on decaf” when he hosted a talk radio show and who quoted the Bible when he was in Congress. Experience: A six-term Indiana congressman, Mr. Pence was elected governor in 2012. He has ushered in big tax cuts and last year drew national attention for signing a “religious freedom” law that critics said allowed businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples. Childhood: The son of a gas station manager, Mr. Pence was an altar boy and once considered entering the priesthood. He was raised as a Catholic, though he now considers himself a born-again Christian. Family: Mr. Pence married his wife, Karen, in 1985. They have a son and two daughters. Education: Graduated from Hanover College, in Hanover, Ind., in 1981 and received a law degree from the Indiana University McKinney School of Law in 1986. How he could help Mr. Trump: Mr. Pence could appease social conservatives who remain wary of Mr. Trump, who also needs to do well in the Rust Belt. Mr. Pence would give him a strong footing in Indiana, a swing state. Mr. Pence, who is seen as averse to confrontational politics, could provide a counterweight to some of the harsher aspects of Mr. Trump’s personality. How he could hurt Mr. Trump: Mr. Pence’s conservative positions could turn off moderates and independents. He lacks national name recognition and he failed to deliver Indiana for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whom he supported in the state’s Republican primary, suggesting that his presence on the ticket might not be enough to tip the general election to Mr. Trump. Fun fact: The Pences are animal lovers and would bring their beagle, Maverick, and their two cats, Pickle and Oreo, to the vice-presidential residence. Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, who Donald J. Trump announced as his running mate on Friday, has a relatively low approval rating among governors.

The answer to the question: How many nautical miles does the does the coastal nation have sole exploitation rights over natural resources? is inside the article: \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources.

Answer the following question: Why is the narrator so sullen after a trip ?","output":"In order to answer the question, let's break down the information provided step by step: Step 1: Understand the context The narrator mentioned two failed long-distance relationships. This implies that the narrator has experienced emotional pain and perhaps some disillusionment with relationships. Step 2: Analyze the situation The narrator mentioned that 'you' (the person they are talking about) came to their place to take a break from normal life. This suggests that the narrator and this person spent time together and perhaps developed a connection during this period. Step 3: Identify the emotions involved The narrator uses words like \\"reality weighs heavily upon my heart\\" and mentions that they return to a home that looks the same as before 'you' were gone. This indicates that the narrator feels sadness, loss, and a sense of emptiness after the person left. Step 4: Answer the question The narrator is so sullen after the trip because they have developed an emotional connection with the person who visited them, which has now ended. The visit may have temporarily filled the void left by their previous failed long-distance relationships. The person leaving to go back to their normal life has likely brought back feelings of loss and sadness for the narrator, reminding them of their previous experiences with relationships that didn't work out. Returning to a home that hasn't changed physically serves as a painful reminder that despite their emotional journey, nothing has changed in their surroundings, making the gap left by the departing visitor even more apparent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Given the background: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .  and the situation: Mike is studying for his biology exam. He found that all body cells are not equal in size - some are large and some are small. He labeled the large cells as class A cells. Then he labeled the small cells as class B cells. He is now prepared to find the differences between them.  Answer the following question: Which cell might not have microvilli as a feature, class A or class B? A:","output":"Based on the given background information, it is likely that class A cells, the large cells, would have microvilli as a feature. This is because large, metabolically active cells often have many folds and protrusions, such as microvilli, to increase their surface area for efficient transport of materials into or out of the cell. On the other hand, class B cells, which are the small cells, might not have microvilli as a feature since their smaller size may not require additional surface area adaptations for effective nutrient absorption and waste removal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: This movie is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious. The box art for the video markets it as a \\"fun throwback\\" to 1950s giant bug movies. In reality, it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of \\"Aliens\\". The producers clearly wanted to make an \\"ALIEN\\" picture, but they mustn't have had much money. In fact, it doesn't look like they had ANY money, really. I hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing. The basic plot is retained--group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature--and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons, I presume. Instead of setting the film in space, where no one can hear you scream, they set the film in a hospital, where everyone can see your budget laid bare. The amusing thing about \\"Blue Monkey\\" (and there is only one thing amusing about it) is, the filmmakers didn't abandon the \\"ALIEN\\" aesthetics. Even though we're in a hospital, we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted, in this case the venerable \\"growth hormone\\" plot device. The annex also doubles as a boiler room (or something), so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth. The boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi-leveled steel catwalks, perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats. The idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location. He touches it and says \\"Ow\\", so we know he's been hurt. The cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes, and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth (I guess in an \\"ALIEN\\" picture this would be called the \\"mouthburster\\"?). The worm is isolated, but some naughty little kids (leukemia patients) sneak up on it and \\"accidentally\\" give it some experimental growth hormone. You know everyone's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane, and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons, right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi-convincing insectoid arms. The rest of the movie is dominated by the semi-offscreen monster, semi-obscured by the semi-darkness. Which brings us back to \\"ALIEN\\". How, you ask, can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the \\"ALIEN\\" movies? No problem...a power outage (or something) causes the electrical system to go awry, which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie. This doubles as a convenient cloak for the less-than-special effects (although the bugs are pretty neat looking, they don't move too well, and the baby bug looks charmingly like a Cootie toy). OK, so what \\"ALIEN\\" bases haven't we covered...OH, water dripping down the walls! Check...we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts, then send some of the characters through the damp, drippy basement to get to the other side. Problem solved, we now have the opportunity for numerous \\"foreboding tunnel\\" shots. And don't forget the fog...well, you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies, do you? OK, maybe inside of a hospital you do, so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark & burn. I haven't said anything about the negligible acting, not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow. I take it \\"Blue Monkey\\" was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag. See a film called \\"Return of the Aliens: The Deadly Spawn\\" if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right, with even less money and even more marginal acting talent.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose only child was Lisa Marie?  Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home.

I don't reckon the sun's ever come up quite the same since the day it happened. I've been watching it for years now and to me it still don't look right somehow. Maybe it's just me thinking it, sending myself doolally after what I've done. But I swear every morning it creeps up and it's looking at me, all knowing like. And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since.

No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Linus suffers withdrawal after being separated from what? his blanket A:","output":"Title: The Unraveling Thread Step 1: Introduce the protagonist, Linus, and establish the importance of his blanket Our protagonist, Linus, is a young man in his 20s who has had an intense emotional attachment to a particular blanket since childhood. The blanket is an old, worn, and frayed, yet intricately woven piece passed down through generations in his family. Linus relies on his blanket for comfort during times of stress and uncertainty. Step 2: Create a dramatic event that separates Linus from his blanket One day, while Linus is out, his apartment catches on fire due to an electrical fault. Linus returns home to find his apartment in ruins and his beloved blanket destroyed. Devastated, Linus goes through the motions of life but is overwhelmed by anxiety and loss without his security blanket. Step 3: Introduce a supporting character who pushes Linus to cope with the loss Linus's best friend, Emily, who has been supportive of him throughout their friendship, notices that Linus has changed since the loss of his blanket. She encourages Linus to face his fears by suggesting therapy to help cope with his withdrawal symptoms and anxiety. Step 4: Present a goal for Linus - recreate the blanket As part of his therapy, Linus's therapist suggests that he could rebuild the connection he had with the blanket by learning how to weave and recreating the blanket himself. Linus starts attending a weaving class, reluctantly at first, but slowly becomes more engrossed in the process. Step 5: Introduce a subplot - Linus discovers the origin of the blanket Linus finds a small, undamaged piece of his original blanket among the charred remains of his apartment and realizes that the design on the blanket is actually a map. Intrigued, Linus traces his family's history and discovers that his ancestors were skilled weavers who used their talents to hide vital information (like maps) within their creations. Step 6: Introduce a conflict - Linus must choose between recreating the blanket or revealing the map to its intended recipients Linus learns that the map woven into his ancestral blanket leads to a long-lost treasure that once belonged to a powerful but secretive group. Linus must choose between recreating the blanket as a means to regain personal comfort, or relinquishing the information to the secret group to protect them from a potential threat. Step 7: Climax - Linus makes a decision and faces the consequences Ultimately, Linus decides that the greater good is more important than his personal attachment to the blanket. He gives the map to the appropriate people within the secret group, who thank him for his sacrifice.  Step 8: Resolution - Linus learns to cope without the blanket Linus continues attending therapy sessions and weaving classes, finding new ways to manage his anxiety. With the support of Emily and the confidence gained from his journey, Linus begins to live a fulfilling life without depending on the security of his childhood blanket. The Unraveling Thread is a heartfelt story about embracing change, personal growth, and overcoming emotional attachments and fears. Linus' journey is an inspiring tale of bravery and sacrifice, demonstrating the importance of self-discovery and the power of friendship."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Summarize this article: If you get into an argument with your child, don't let your ego get in the way of your relationship regardless of whether you are wrong or right. Try to remind yourself that you are the parent, and letting a fight drag on simply because you want to win is not good for your child or your relationship with them.   Develop your conflict resolution skills. If you struggle with what to do when a problem arises between you and your child, then work on your conflict resolution skills. Developing ways to calm down, analyze the situation, and communicate effectively with your child will help to ensure that you do not behave like a toxic parent. Your child will likely forget about who won or lost a certain fight, but they will probably remember how your actions during that fight made them feel about you and themselves. Thus, it is important to be as mature as possible. Don't ignore your child or make them feel stupid. If you're not sure how to end a fight, try calmly telling your child you need a few minutes to yourself. Take this time to calm down if you need. When you've calmed down, return to your child, and apologize for fighting. You don't even need to bring up what the fight was about or who was right/wrong. If you can't bring yourself to apologize, you can at least say, “I don't like it when we fight. Let's go do something fun together instead.” Give them a hug, and remind them how much you love them. For many parents, this can be difficult to do, especially if you tend to be overcritical of yourself. Many parents criticize their children because they simply want them to be the best they can be without realizing how this makes the child feel about themselves. Thus, it's important to think before you speak when you talk with your child, especially when it comes to talking to them about their performance on something. Instead, act as a guide for your child. Remind yourself that your child is learning how to do things every day, and they need your help, not your judgments.  If you have a hard time grasping this, think about how you feel when someone you love criticizes you. It probably doesn't make you feel good about yourself, even if you know it's not true. Even the most secure people don't enjoy being criticized. If your child is doing something that you think should be done differently, avoid saying something like, “That's such a dumb way to do that. Why would you think that's a good idea?” Instead, say something more positive such as, “You're doing great, can I show you how I normally do it? Then you can do it whichever way you prefer.” Remember that just because you do something a certain way doesn't mean it is the best way. Even if it is the best way, it's good to let your child have autonomy and figure some things out for themselves. One habit of many toxic parents is that they demand the attention of their children, especially when they are upset about something. Remind yourself, that, in your relationship with your child, you are not the center of attention, and your child probably doesn't have the maturity or coping skills to make you the center of their attention. Even if they do, it is not fair to expect your child to act as your caretaker. This doesn't mean that you can't be honest with your child about emotions you might be having. For example, if you are feeling sad and your child asks you what's wrong, you can tell them that you're feeling sad because something happened that you didn't want to happen. If it is appropriate, you can also tell them the reason you're sad. However, you should also remind your child that you'll be OK, you just need a bit of time to feel sad. You can do this rather than expect them to comfort you. Parenting is tough, so it is important to remember that making mistakes does not make you a toxic parent. Raising children can be very difficult, and occasionally, you might lose your cool. It is important to tell your child that you're sorry, remind them that you love them very much, and explain to them why you lost your temper, but make it clear that it wasn't because you think they are a bad kid. Forgive yourself. When you make a mistake, don't beat yourself up over it. You can reflect on what happened and why you think it happened in order to do better in the future, but it won't help you or your children to let yourself feel like a failure. Abuse is perhaps the worst thing that can happen to a child. The obvious forms of abuse are physical and sexual abuse. Both of these forms of abuse constitute completely unacceptable forms of behavior for a parent. However, a perhaps more common form of abuse is verbal abuse, which toxic parents are often guilty of using. This occurs whenever you say something to your child that harms their sense of self-worth or playing mind games aimed at putting you in control of your child's emotions.  Verbal abuse may not leave physical signs that the abuse happened, but it certainly leaves emotional scars that may afflict your child for the rest of your life. Many parents aren't aware of the research, which makes it clear that spanking is just as harmful to a child's emotional well-being as other forms of physical abuse, such as slapping, punching, pinching, etc.  If you have been spanking your child as a means of punishment, look for other, healthier ways to discipline your child for bad behavior. For example, take away a privilege and explain to them the reason that they have lost that privilege and when they can have it back. When it comes to child sexual abuse, any form of sexual touching between a child and an adult is considered sexual abuse. If you realize that you have been abusing your child either physically, sexually, or verbally, you should recognize that you have a problem and stop immediately. Seeking professional help for your issues is perhaps the best way to deal with anger and control issues.  The first thing you need to do is understand what abuse is. Stop trying to rationalize your behavior. Yes, parenting is tough, but abusing is never a good (or acceptable) way to deal with your frustration no matter how mad you might be. In many cases, abusers often abuse because that's how they were raised. Getting professional help to learn how to better deal with your anger and emotions is often the best way to stop the cycle. One way to avoid abusing a child is to walk away from the situation when you feel that you are too frustrated or angry to deal with the situation rationally. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Summary:","output":"This article says that when you argue with your child, it's important to not let your feelings get in the way and remember that you are the parent. You should work on solving problems together and being kind, instead of criticizing or ignoring them. It's also important to not expect your child to take care of you when you are upset. When you make a mistake, say sorry and forgive yourself.

The band consists of Kelly Jones (lead vocals, lead guitar), Richard Jones (bass, piano, backing vocals), Adam Zindani (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Jamie Morrison (drums) and touring member Tony Kirkham (keyboards). The group previously included Stuart Cable (1992-2003) and then Javier Weyler (2004-2012) on drums. Stereophonics have released ten studio albums, including six UK number one albums. The band released their third album, Just Enough Education to Perform, in April 2001. The album included the track \\"Mr. Writer\\", which includes lyrics that criticise a critic who the band believe gave them a negative review. The album also contained one of the band's most famous tracks, \\"Have a Nice Day\\", which reached number five in the UK charts. To promote the new album, Just Enough Education to Perform, the Stereophonics played a two-day festival, which was called A Day at the Races. This event was held in Donington Park on the first day and at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on the second. The concerts were supported by Ash, Black Crowes and the Crocketts, with Proud Mary playing Donington only. Over 200,000 separate tickets were sold for the weekend festival. The performance was released on a DVD in 2002.  2003 saw the release of their fourth album, titled You Gotta Go There to Come Back. In September 2003, drummer Stuart Cable was sacked. According to reports, it was because of his lack of commitment to the band. Cable, at the time, presented a TV show called \\"Cable TV\\" and felt that the band would never improve. Because of this, he missed several rehearsals and live concerts. He was eventually replaced by Javier Weyler. Steve Gorman, from the Black Crowes, stood in for Cable during the band's live performances until Weyler was appointed. When asked about Cable leaving the band in a 2010 interview with Rip It Up magazine, Kelly Jones admitted to the difficulty of the situation.  Towards the end of the year, Stereophonics did a sold-out tour of the UK, ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, supported by Feeder, Ocean Colour Scene and Adam Masterson. The show was closed with a live version of \\"Merry Xmas Everybody\\", originally recorded by Slade.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name whose older sister hears nothing but praise from their mother?  Connie Wyatt is a restless 15-year-old who is anxious to explore the pleasures of her sexual awakening. Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family farm house. She suffers from her mother's put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising the local shopping mall with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from the boy's car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, \\"I'm watching you!\\" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the house, while her family goes to a barbecue. Later, as Connie is playing around the house, a man who calls himself Arnold Friend approaches her in a 1960s convertible with that name painted on it and identifies himself as \\"A. Friend\\". He dresses and acts like James Dean, and name-drops several teenybopper acts, even though he is much older than she is. He comes off very kind and friendly, but a bit suspicious, alternating between talking to her in a warm, seductive voice and shouting insults to his fellow car passenger when he asks Arnold if he should \\"pull out the phone,\\" possibly to keep her from calling the police. Arnold tells Connie about how he has been watching her and that he knows all about her, recounting the details about her family's barbecue plans with amazing accuracy. He then starts talking about how he could be her lover. She starts to get scared and tells him to go, but he coerces her into going with him, threatening to burn down the house, while his friend remains at the house, supposedly to watch over it while they are gone.

(CNN) -- Sure, lots of folks might be excited about a Twitter-like social network with no ads or annoying \\"promoted tweets.\\" But would they pay for it? The founders of App.net think so, and so far they've found more than 10,000 people who agree with them. The startup promises a \\"real-time feed\\" that will never be supported by ads. Instead, they'll charge a fee that, at least for now, looks to be about 50. That's how much it took to support a Kickstarter-like fundraising campaign that has netted more than 670,000 and wraps up Monday. Founder and CEO Dalton Caldwell says he's been disappointed by the advertising models of sites like Twitter and Facebook and thinks users will be willing to plunk down money for an alternative. Avoiding ads and opening the service up to developers could offer a glimpse at what","output":"the future of social media might look like – a platform where user experience and quality content reign supreme, without the constant interruption and influence of advertising. By eliminating ads, App.net envisions a social platform where users can enjoy a more organic and authentic experience. They believe that by charging a fee, they can offer superior service while maintaining user privacy and satisfaction. This also allows them to focus solely on fostering meaningful connections and conversations between users, without the driving force of profits from advertising. Moreover, by opening up the platform to developers, App.net encourages innovative new features and improvements to be created by third-party developers. This could result in a more diverse and robust ecosystem that caters to user needs, allowing the platform to stay ahead in terms of technological advancements and user experience. This collaborative approach invites creativity and enables the development of custom applications to enhance the social network's functionality. App.net's model could potentially revolutionize social media by proving that users are willing to pay for a premium ad-free experience, leading to other platforms following suit. This shift could create an online environment where users have greater control over their own data and experience while empowering creators and developers to push the boundaries of social media innovation. However, it's worth noting that this model might not be appealing to everyone. For some users, the 50 annual fee may seem too steep, especially considering how many social media platforms are available free of charge. Additionally, the reliance on developers to improve and evolve the platform might lead to inconsistencies or slow growth in new features and improvements compared to competitor platforms that monetize through advertising and invest heavily in in-house development. Regardless of whether App.net ultimately succeeds in making a lasting impact, it serves as an intriguing exploration of the potential for ad-free, user-centered social media. As concerns surrounding data privacy and advertising overload continue to grow, companies and users may increasingly turn to alternative platforms that prioritize user experience and offer innovative models that shift away from ad-supported revenue streams."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: The Belarusian government sponsors annual cultural festivals such as the Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk, which showcases Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Several state holidays, such as Independence Day and Victory Day, draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk. The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country. Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of Cyril of Turaw.By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk. After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of \\"Belarusianization\\" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges. The free development of literature occurred only in Polish-held territory until Soviet occupation in 1939. Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus and would not return until the 1960s.The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by Vasil Bykaŭ and Uladzimir Karatkievich.

Over the course of 10 days, take your tomato plant to a sheltered area in your garden and let it sit. Start with a few hours on day one and add a bit more time each day. This process is known as hardening off your plant. When choosing a spot, look for an area where your plant will receive filtered sunlight, such as through tree branches, and is protected from wind and debris. In the spot you plan on planting your tomatoes, use a digging fork to loosen your soil to about 8 inches (20 cm) deep. Spread about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of organic compost over the soil, followed by a similar amount of balanced all-purpose fertilizer. Make sure the compost and fertilizer are evenly spread and mixed into the soil. Let the ground sit for a few days before planting. Use a ruler or tape measure to find the height of your plant from the bottom of its container to the top of its stalk. Use this number to create a hole in the middle of the area you will transplant your tomatoes to. The hole should be a few inches deeper than the plant itself. Carefully remove the seedling from its pot, being extra gentle when loosening the roots. Place the plant in the hole with only the top leaves sticking above ground.

In this sentence, Joel takes on the role of a caring and responsible father, ensuring that his son Justin has everything he needs in terms of groceries and nourishment. By performing this act of care and service, Joel is demonstrating his love and commitment to his child's well-being and ensuring that he is providing for his family, something a father might typically be expected to do. This sentence highlights the relationship between Joel and Justin, emphasizing the parental bond between them. The act of grocery shopping may seem like a mundane task, but it carries a deeper meaning as it reflects the daily responsibilities and sacrifices that parents often make for their children, and serves as a way to bond and establish trust in the relationship. By mentioning that Joel is shopping for Justin, the author makes it clear that the father is providing for the son, and this act of kindness and support forms an essential part of the relationship. Moreover, the act of grocery shopping for someone else can also indicate a willingness to sacrifice one's time and energy for the benefit of another person. This further establishes the deep bond between the two characters, with Joel displaying his affection and commitment towards Justin in a simple, yet meaningful way. On the other hand, if the sentence ended with \\"Justin is his father,\\" it would complicate the relationship between the two characters, potentially implying that Justin is the one who should be responsible for the grocery shopping or other chores. This alternative ending could still signify a strong bond between the characters. However, it would potentially suggest a closer examination of their roles and responsibilities within their family dynamics. Overall, the sentence ending with \\"Joel is his father\\" strengthens the connection between the two characters and showcases the care, love, and responsibility a father often has towards his child.

The most common way humans contribute to the extinction of organisms is by Pick the answer from these options","output":"Although you have not provided answer options, I can provide you with a comprehensive explanation of the most common ways humans contribute to the extinction of organisms. 1. Habitat destruction: One of the primary reasons for species extinction is the loss or modification of their natural habitat. Human activities like deforestation, urbanization, agriculture, mining, and infrastructure development lead to the removal of vital habitats for various organisms. As these habitats shrink or fragment, the species depending on them find it harder to find food, water, and mates, leading to a decline in population and ultimately extinction. 2. Overexploitation: Overhunting, overfishing, and other forms of excessive resource extraction can push species toward extinction. Many species have become extinct or critically endangered due to the demand for their parts, such as elephant tusks, rhino horns, and tiger bones. Additionally, overfishing can lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems, as the delicate balance between interconnected species is disrupted. 3. Pollution: Emission of harmful substances such as chemicals, pesticides, and plastic waste into the environment disrupts ecosystems and affects the health and survival of numerous species. Pollution can cause habitat degradation, poisoning of food sources, and physical harm to organisms, resulting in population declines and eventual extinction. 4. Climate change: Global warming and climate change, driven by human activities like fossil fuel consumption and deforestation, are creating significant challenges for the survival of various species. As a result of climate change, some species lose their habitats, while others face altered patterns of precipitation, temperature, and other environmental conditions that threaten their survival prospects. For example, certain species may struggle to adapt to rising ocean temperatures and acidification, leading to population decline or extinction. 5. Invasive species: When humans introduce non-native species to new environments, often accidentally or through globalization, these new species can compete with native ones for resources, predate on them, or introduce diseases. This can lead to a decline in native species populations and ultimately extinction. 6. Disease: Human activities sometimes facilitate the introduction and spread of diseases among wild species. For instance, shipping containers and agricultural trade can facilitate the spread of pathogens and pests that affect native flora and fauna. Additionally, human-created environments can provide breeding grounds for disease vectors like mosquitoes, leading to increased disease transmission. In conclusion, the most common way humans contribute to the extinction of organisms is through a combination of factors like habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, climate change, invasive species introduction, and disease. All these factors are driven by human activities, and addressing them requires concerted efforts from individuals, communities, businesses, and governments to promote sustainable development, conservation, and environmental stewardship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont's western border with the state of New York and the Green Mountains run north-south the length of the state.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Sir Waldron Smithers (5 October 1880  9 December 1954) was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was a member of Parliament for more than 30 years and an active anti-communist.  - The South Eastern and Chatham Railway Companies Joint Management Committee (SE&CRCJMC), known as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&CR), was a working union of two neighbouring rival railways, the South Eastern Railway (SER) and London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR), which operated between London and south-east England. Between 1899 and 1923, the SE&CR had a monopoly of railway services in Kent and to the main Channel ports for ferries to France and Belgium.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Grand Trunk Railway was a railway system that operated in the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and in the American states of Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont.

WHITE HOUSE — White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who was asked to leave a Virginia restaurant days ago, told reporters on Monday that \\"calls for harassment and a push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable.\\" She was referring to comments from Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who previously has called for President Donald Trump's impeachment. Waters told supporters, \\"If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\\" The most prominent Democrat in the House of Representatives, however, disagreed with Walters. \\"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable,\\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter on Monday. \\"As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\\" Pelosi's tweet included a link to a CNN story about Waters encouraging harassment of Trump administration officials. Trump also responded to Water's remarks, saying on Twitter that the congresswoman — whom he referred to as an \\"extraordinarily low IQ person\\" — had called for his supporters to be harassed. In the social media message, the president concluded, \\"Be careful what you wish for Max!\\" Last week, protesters yelled at Department of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen at an upscale Mexican restaurant near the White House. Earlier, Nielsen publicly defended the policy of separating children from parents who were apprehended for illegally entering the U.S., a policy the president has since reversed.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What culture's invasion of the hills that were occupied by two types of settlements was most likely for silver?, using the article: Twenty Palaeolithic sites have been identified in the Mendips, of which eleven represent faunal remains and lithic artefacts recovered from caves. The remaining eight sites refer to surface lithic discoveries, and the artefacts found include points, scrapers, and handaxes. Twenty-seven Mesolithic finds are represented by flint and chert lithics. Large numbers of artefacts have been found near Neolithic, Iron Age, and Bronze Age features, such as the barrows and forts around Priddy and at Dolebury Warren. The caves of Cheddar Gorge have yielded many archaeological remains, as flood waters have washed artefacts and bones into the caves and preserved them in silt. The Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton, was found in Gough's Cave, part of the Cheddar Complex.Within the Mendip Hills AONB, good evidence exists for 286 definite examples of round barrows, including the Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries. The Historic England Archive holds over 1,200 entries for the area, and there are over 600 listed buildings, in addition to over 200 scheduled ancient monuments. These protected monuments range from prehistoric barrows and hillforts to the Black Down bombing decoy from the Second World War.Settlement on the Mendip Hills appears to fall into two types. The first, apparent in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated on a small scale in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.There is evidence of mining dating back to the late Bronze Age, when there were technological changes in metal-working..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The culture whose invasion of the hills that were occupied by two types of settlements was most likely for silver can be inferred from the given information about the Mendip Hills. In the article, it is mentioned that there is evidence of mining dating back to the late Bronze Age, technological changes in metal-working, and large landholdings based on mines or stock grazing from the Iron Age onwards. Considering these details, it can be suggested that the Roman culture might have been most likely responsible for the invasion of the hills for the extraction of precious metals such as silver. The Romans are known for their expertise in mining and metallurgy, in addition to their conquests and expansions across different territories.  In the context of the Mendip Hills, the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods are marked by large sites with specialist functions, which could be indicative of significant mining activities. These sites existed by exerting power over lowland producers, potentially for mining and resource extraction purposes. Furthermore, during the Roman era, the ownership of land took increasing importance, leading to large landholdings based on mines or stock grazing. Taking all this into account, it seems that the Roman culture's invasion of the Mendip Hills, occupied by two types of settlements, was most likely driven by the pursuit of silver and other valuable resources found in the region. Their administrative and technological expertise, along with their expansionist policies, support the argument that they would be most likely to invade the hills for silver extraction purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.  Now, I have a new situation: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth.

She had been sick for the last few years and, though my job had taken me away across the town, I tried to visit her as much as possible. I helped with the shopping, the cooking and the cleaning and taking her pet cat Mazy to the vet.  Sad as her passing away was, what happened to Mazy was even more worrying. Because aunt Suzy had no children, there wasn't anyone who seemed to care for her beloved cat friend. I would have taken her in a short time, but my apartment doesn't allow pets. First, we talked with her neighbors. Mr. Jenkins, who was alone and lived across the street, wasn't interested. Joe and Sally who lived next door had a small child with serious skin allergies . My aunt's best friend Molly who had lived just down the road was unable to take care of herself as she had serious health problems.  Second, we thought about our family members. My brother Bobby and his wife Jill were _ at once as they aren't cat people. My cousin in California was a bit interested, but we weren't sure about the trip as Mazy was nearly as old as my aunt (in cat years!). Finally, we came to the local humane society to see whether they would be able to help her find a new home. The problem was that most people and families only welcomed a smart little cat into their home, not a dull old one.  In the end, we had to put Mazy to sleep. I had spoken with the vet and realized it was possible for the best. It was so hard to lose aunt Suzy and then have nowhere for Mazy to live. A few months went by and I had gone to my aunt's house to clear out some of her belongings. I happened to see her mailman. Jerry and we started to talk about my aunt when he asked about Mazy. I told him that we had to put Mazy to sleep because we couldn't find a home for her. Jerry got really quiet. \\"I promised Suzy that if anything ever happened to her, I'd take care of Mazy\\", he said sadly. \\"Suzy always said she'd told her lawyer the arrangement.\\"  Hearing this, my heart sank to my feet and I almost cried. The saddest part, I realized, was this all could have been avoided. I guess we were just so busy in those final months that we didn't think about it.

What does Balaji Vishwanathan think about GST Bill? What difference will GST Bill make now? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose your answer from: [I] no; [II] yes;","output":"[I] no; Balaji Vishwanathan, a prominent Indian Quoran and technology expert, has shared his views on the GST Bill (Goods and Services Tax) in various online platforms. He generally holds a positive view of the GST Bill, which is a comprehensive tax reform for India. According to his perspective, GST is a significant step towards enhancing efficiency and reducing complexity in the previous tax system.  Regarding the first question, Balaji Vishwanathan believes that the GST Bill has the potential to substantially alter the economic landscape of India. The Bill aims to decompose the tax system into a unified structure, removing the cascading tax effect, and promoting the ease of doing business. It is designed to streamline compliance, increase government's revenue, and foster healthy competition among businesses and states. Thus, GST is expected to make India a more attractive destination for multinational corporations and foreign investors. As for the second question, the difference that the GST Bill makes now can be observed on both micro and macroeconomic scales.  1. Reducing tax burden: GST consolidates various indirect taxes such as the Central Excise Tax, Value Added Tax (VAT), and Service Tax into a single tax regime. This consolidation helps reduce the tax burden on consumers and businesses. 2. Simplification of tax processes: GST reduces complexity and simplifies the tax processes by eliminating the need to deal with multiple tax authorities at the central and state level. This makes the tax system more manageable for businesses and minimizes evasion. 3. Enhancing competitiveness: By removing cascading tax effects and reducing costs, GST promotes fair market competition and encourages investment. 4. Increasing government revenue: GST improves tax compliance, which eventually leads to higher tax revenues for the government.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?  A. Fold your towel into its desired form and attach Velcro strips in two spots, one on the front and one on the back,. B. Fold your towel into its desired form and attach Velcro strips in one spot, one on the front or one on the back,.","output":"Both options A and B can help you accomplish the goal of keeping your towel from falling off the handle of the oven or fridge. However, considering the effectiveness and stability, option A seems to make more sense. Here's a detailed analysis of each option to help you understand better: Option A: Fold your towel into its desired form and attach Velcro strips in two spots, one on the front and one on the back. 1. Enhanced stability: Attaching Velcro strips in two spots (one on the front and one on the back) will provide better stability when the towel is hung on the handle. This will help ensure that the towel remains in place even when you accidentally brush against it or pull on it. 2. Improved grip and support: By attaching Velcro strips in two spots, you're creating a more secure connection between the towel and the handle. This enhanced grip will prevent the towel from slipping or falling off the handle, making it more convenient for you when you need to use the towel. 3. Easier and quicker to fold: With Velcro strips at both the front and the back, you only need to align the strips when folding the towel. This means that you can easily and quickly fold the towel into its desired form without needing to fiddle with the position of the Velcro strips. 4. Better weight distribution: When you have Velcro strips on both sides of the towel, the weight of the towel is evenly distributed across the handle, preventing any strain on one side or causing any damage to the appliance handle. Option B: Fold your towel into its desired form and attach Velcro strips in one spot, one on the front or one on the back. 1. Less stability: Having only one Velcro strip means that the towel will have less overall support, making it more likely to fall off the handle when brushed against or pulled on. 2. Weaker grip and support: With just one Velcro strip, the grip between the towel and the handle will be weaker, potentially allowing the towel to slip or fall off more easily. 3. More challenging to fold: Since there's only one Velcro strip, folding the towel into its desired form may require more adjustments to ensure that the strip is placed in the correct position. 4. Uneven weight distribution: With only one Velcro strip, the weight of the towel will be primarily supported by that strip, causing strain on one side of the handle and potentially damaging the appliance handle over time. In conclusion, option A makes more sense to accomplish the goal of keeping your towel from falling off the handle of the oven or fridge. Attaching Velcro strips in two spots (one on the front and one on the back) provides better stability, support, and weight distribution, making it more practical and effective in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Apple Computer #39;s stock has continued to soar along with sales of its iPod digital music player, topping 50 a share for the first time in four years.","output":"This is about the technology company Apple Inc.'s stock performance and its correlation with the sales of its iPod digital music player. The context refers to a period when the company's stock reached an important milestone, surpassing 50 per share for the first time in four years. This surge in stock valuation is attributed to the increasing popularity and sales of the iPod product line. The iPod, launched in October 2001, revolutionized the way people listen to music. The easy-to-use interface, sleek design, and large storage capacity distinguished it from other portable music players at that time. The iPod's success contributed significantly to Apple's revenue growth, leading to a positive impact on the company's stock price. The period mentioned (i.e., first time reaching 50 in four years) likely corresponds to an era when the iPod was thriving, with the company introducing several iterations of the device to cater to different customer segments. These include the iPod Mini, iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, and the iPod Touch. Each of these products was designed to target various market needs, thereby expanding Apple's customer base and driving up sales figures. The stock's rapid climb in valuation clearly demonstrates the strong correlation between the success of the iPod and the company's overall financial performance. Notably, during the early 2000s, Apple Inc. faced stagnant growth, and the introduction of the iPod bolstered the company's prospects, leading to a renewed vigor in the organization. Moreover, it must be highlighted that the iPod's success laid the foundation for the development and release of the iPhone in 2007. The iPhone integrated elements of the iPod (music player) with telephone capabilities, in addition to introducing a multitude of other features that rendered it a revolutionary product in the smartphone market. This inevitably contributed to bolstering Apple Inc's stock, making it one of the most valuable and recognizable companies in the world. In conclusion, this statement is about Apple Inc's stock milestone, attributed to the strong sales performance of the iPod digital music player. The successful product line not only resulted in remarkable revenue growth, but it also allowed the company to expand its unique product offerings and position itself as an industry leader in the technology space. Ultimately, the impact of the iPod on Apple's stock performance serves as a prime example of how innovative and pioneering products can drive significant and long-lasting business growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we have two numbers (3983 and 4060) that both have an \\"i\\" next to them. The problem tells us to subtract these numbers. We need to find out what \\"i\\" is, which is like finding the missing piece of the puzzle. Here's the problem we need to solve: 3983 * i - 4060 * i = 77 Now, let's follow these steps: 1.

Q: Passage: In Las Meninas, the king and queen are supposedly \\"outside\\" the painting, yet their reflection in the back wall mirror also places them \\"inside\\" the pictorial space.Snyder proposes it is \\"a mirror of majesty\\" or an allusion to the mirror for princes. While it is a literal reflection of the king and queen, Snyder writes \\"it is the image of exemplary monarchs, a reflection of ideal character\\"  Later he focuses his attention on the princess, writing that Velázquez's portrait is \\"the painted equivalent of a manual for the education of the princess—a mirror of the princess\\". The painting is likely to have been influenced by Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, of 1434. At the time, van Eyck's painting hung in Philip's palace, and would have been familiar to Velázquez. The Arnolfini Portrait also has a mirror positioned at the back of the pictorial space, reflecting two figures who would have the same angle of vision as does the viewer of Velázquez's painting; they are too small to identify, but it has been speculated that one may be intended as the artist himself, though he is not shown in the act of painting. According to Lucien Dällenbach: The mirror [in Las Meninas] faces the observer as in Van Eyck's painting. But here the procedure is more realistic to the degree that the \\"rearview\\" mirror in which the royal couple appears is no longer convex but flat. Whereas the reflection in the Flemish painting recomposed objects and characters within a space that is condensed and deformed by the curve of the mirror, that of Velázquez refuses to play with the laws of perspective: it projects onto the canvas the perfect double of the king and queen positioned in front of the painting. Moreover, in showing the figures whom the painter observes, and also, through the mediation of the mirror, the figures who are observing him, the painter achieves a reciprocity of gazes that makes the interior oscillate with the exterior and which causes the image to \\"emerge from its frame\\" at the same time that it invites the visitors to enter the painting. Jonathan Miller asks: \\"What are we to make of the blurred features of the royal couple? It is unlikely that it has anything to do with the optical imperfection of the mirror, which would, in reality, have displayed a focused image of the King and Queen\\". He notes that \\"in addition to the represented mirror, he teasingly implies an unrepresented one, without which it is difficult to imagine how he could have shown himself painting the picture we now see\\".

Mr Shaw has so far met 129 friends in Manchester, Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent. Article:","output":"Title: Man on a Social Mission: Daniel Shaw's Journey to Meet 730 Facebook Friends in a Year In a world where people often boast thousands of Facebook friends, how many do we truly know? And better yet, how many do we take the time to nurture genuine connections with? Enter Daniel Shaw, a 38-year-old youth worker from the UK, who aims to challenge the notion of superficial social media friendships by going on a mission to meet 730 out of his 1,103 Facebook friends in just one year's time. This ambitious idea was born when Shaw's friends bet that he didn't actually know all his Facebook connections. Never one to back down from a challenge, Shaw took the daring leap and set out to prove them wrong, while simultaneously raising money for a charitable cause - the Motor Neurone Disease Association. As a youth worker, Daniel often encounters young people who struggle with loneliness and depression. In an increasingly digitized world, it's easy to feel isolated despite being constantly surrounded by friends online. By embarking on this journey, Shaw seeks to remind people of the importance of cultivating meaningful relationships, both online and offline, and by doing so, he also hopes to raise awareness and funds for a disease that affects 5,000 people in the UK alone. Though the journey has just begun, Shaw has already managed to meet 129 of his Facebook friends in Manchester, Birmingham, and Stoke-on-Trent, demonstrating his unwavering dedication to the cause. These meetings typically involve face-to-face conversations, sharing stories, and creating lasting memories – experiences that cannot be replicated through likes and comments on a screen. In addition to challenging the status quo of social media use, Shaw's journey is also an inspiring story for people dealing with personal struggles. By showcasing the value and impact of  true connection and human interaction, Shaw is encouraging those who may struggle with their emotional well-being to build genuine connections and reach out when they are in need. Through his meetings with friends, Shaw has come across numerous heartwarming stories and developed a deeper understanding of the people he once only knew through their Facebook profiles. These encounters have become a testament to the power of human interaction, illustrating that each and every individual carries a wealth of unique experiences, perspectives, and strengths that can only be tapped into when we take the time to engage and truly listen to one another. Shaw's tireless efforts have been met with immense gratitude by the Motor Neurone Disease Association. The organization relies on generous donations to fund the care and support needed for individuals living with this disorder, as well as to advance the research for treatments and potential cures. Every pound raised through Shaw's journey will make a significant difference in the lives of those affected by the disease. As he continues on this incredible adventure, there's little doubt that Daniel Shaw will achieve his goal of meeting 730 Facebook friends in one year. Through his pursuit, Shaw not only underscores the value of genuine connection and friendship, but also sheds light on an often misunderstood disease, providing hope and inspiration to countless individuals. In a time when social media has become a staple of modern life, Shaw's quest serves as a gentle reminder that authentic connections and friendships, not merely online acquaintances, are what truly nourish the human spirit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This was despite what A. C. Crombie (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls \\"a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity\\", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the Aristotelian concentration on the observable properties of the physical world. But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Please answer this question: what temperature does water boil at in fahrenheit?","output":"Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) under standard atmospheric pressure, which is defined as exactly 1 atmosphere (atm) or 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) or 101.3 kilopascals (kPa). It is essential to understand that this boiling point can vary with changes in atmospheric pressure and other environmental factors. The boiling point of water is dependent on the pressure exerted on the water's surface. As atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of water also decreases. For example, at higher elevations such as on a mountain, the atmospheric pressure is lower, and the boiling point of water decreases. That is why it takes longer to cook foods by boiling at higher altitudes, as the temperature of boiling water is lower than 212 degrees Fahrenheit. In contrast, with an increase in atmospheric pressure, such as in a pressure cooker, the boiling point of water rises. This is why pressure cookers can cook food more quickly, as the water's boiling point increases, causing the water and steam inside the cooker to reach higher temperatures than in a regular pot. It is also important to mention that impurities or dissolved substances can affect the boiling point of water, either by raising or lowering it. Adding substances such as salt or sugar can cause a phenomenon called \\"boiling point elevation,\\" increasing the boiling point of water slightly. This change in boiling point is more noticeable in solutions with higher concentrations of solutes. In summary, water typically boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) under standard atmospheric pressure. However, changes in atmospheric pressure due to elevation or a change in environmental conditions, as well as the presence of impurities or solutes in the water, can cause variations in the boiling point."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was survived by his third wife, as well as his daughter, Galina, and son, Maxim?  In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence...

He decides to collect water from a nearby stream and boil it to make it safe for drinking.  Will boiling the water increase or decrease entropy?  Hint: There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid. The answer is:","output":"Boiling the water will increase entropy. Entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. In the context of George's camping scenario, boiling the water will cause a phase transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state (vaporization).  When the water is heated and reaches its boiling point, the water molecules gain enough energy to overcome the attractive forces that hold them together in the liquid state, making them move more freely and becoming water vapor (steam). In this gaseous state, the water molecules are no longer confined to a specific volume, and they can move and be dispersed throughout the container or environment. This increase in the number of possible arrangements of the water molecules and the higher degree of randomness are indicative of an increase in entropy. Conversely, a decrease in entropy would involve a system moving towards a more ordered state, such as a liquid freezing into a solid."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- After disrupting a national election, anti-government demonstrators in Thailand have vowed to keep up their campaign against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The troubled election Sunday, which was boycotted by the main opposition party, appears unlikely to resolve Thailand's protracted political crisis, which has fueled bouts of deadly unrest in the Southeast Asian country. During the tense election process, anti-government protesters stopped candidates from registering, blocked delivery of ballot boxes and prevented people from casting their votes. As a result, voting was disrupted in 69 out of the country's 375 electoral districts, authorities said. The demonstrators have been protesting since November, saying they want to rid Thailand of the influence of Yingluck and her older brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives in exile. The anti-government movement draws it support from southern Thailand,","output":"particularly from the urban middle class and royalists, who view the Shinawatra family as corrupt and detrimental to the nation's progress; however, Yingluck's supporters, primarily from the rural north and northeastern regions, argue that her party's policies significantly improve their livelihoods and that she holds a legitimately elected position."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By 2050 that number will be 70%. We are adding the equivalent of seven New York Cities to the planet every year. This unprecedented urbanization is a sign of economic and societal progress, especially in places such as China and in other emerging markets. But the scale and nature of the challenges facing cities mean that business as usual is not a viable option. More than ever before, the tradition of manufacturing as the key driver of urban economic growth is giving way to an economy based on brains and creativity. Competitive differentiation today is more likely to be based on a workforce's ability to foster innovation than on traditional strengths such as the exploitation of natural resources, physical labor or manufacturing prowess. In fact, according to a new IBM study, the demand for knowledge workers is expected to almost double by 2020 in maturing economies, while the demand for low-skilled employees is expected to decline dramatically. To prosper, cities will need to attract those highly skilled employees and create environments that foster knowledge-intensive businesses. They will have to engage in battles for talent for which many are ill-equipped, and focus more on the quality of jobs created--and the people who choose a city to create and fill those jobs--than on the mere quantity of new jobs. In the U.S., cities face an environment of shrinking municipal budgets and fiscal austerity. The good news, however, is that they already have much of what they need to become more livable while delivering cost savings and improved services to citizens. Much of it comes down to one thing: data. Cities can now, for the first time, make sense of the oceans of data that they collect and turn it into intelligence that can empower city officials to take positive action, especially in four crucial areas: education, transportation, public safety and health. Here are examples of how: Education To attract, retain and cultivate talent, cities must provide access to quality primary and secondary education, as well as lifelong learning for a highly skilled workforce. The paradox is that as the demand for and cost of education increases, budgets to support it are in most places static or shrinking. To manage the shortfall, cities are using information technology to take new approaches to teaching and learning, to increase access and to reduce costs. For example, Mobile County Public Schools, Alabama's largest school district, is applying data analytics to track student performance, identify at-risk students and enable teachers to address and resolve issues before they escalate--all in real-time--so they can prepare students with the right skills and reduce dropout and truancy rates. Transportation Well-managed, accessible public transportation attracts workers to cities, brings commuters to and from work and moves goods from production to consumption. One main challenge for cities is traffic congestion, which lowers air quality, creates noise pollution, diminishes public safety and incurs an annual cost of 87 billion in wasted fuel and lost productivity in the U.S. alone. Many cities are sitting on mounds of untapped data that could help them improve their transport systems. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article discusses the significant role of data in building the cities of the future amidst rapid urbanization. By 2050, 70% of the world's population is projected to be living in cities, leading to a shift from traditional manufacturing economies to knowledge-based economies. In order to prosper, cities need to attract highly skilled employees and foster innovation-driven businesses.  Data can play a crucial role in making cities more livable and efficient in four key areas: education, transportation, public safety, and health. 1. Education: Cities need to provide access to quality education at all levels to attract, retain, and cultivate talent. As budgets for education become more constrained, information technology and data analytics are being used to improve teaching and learning methods, increase access, and reduce costs. One example: Mobile County Public Schools uses data analytics to track student performance and identify at-risk students in real-time. 2. Transportation: Accessible public transportation is vital for attracting workers to cities and maintaining productivity. There is a wealth of untapped data that cities can use to improve their transport systems. By addressing traffic congestion issues, which contribute to pollution, public safety risks, and lost productivity, cities can become more attractive and sustainable. In summary, this article emphasizes the importance of data in addressing the challenges posed by rapid urbanization and the shift towards knowledge-based economies. Cities that harness the power of data in areas such as education and transportation will be better equipped to attract highly skilled employees and foster innovative businesses, ultimately creating a more livable, sustainable, and prosperous urban environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Harry Potter spoilers spread over Internet NEW YORK (AP) -- In the final days before the world learns whether Harry Potter lives or dies, spoilers -- or those pretending to spoil -- are spreading on the Internet. What's going to happen to Harry Potter? A number of Internet postings claim to have the answer. On Tuesday, digital images of what may be the entire text of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" including 36 chapters and a seven-page epilogue, were circulating among Web users. The book was apparently photographed as it lay on a carpet speckled with green and red, a hand at the bottom holding down the pages. A separate link, http://www.zendurl.com/h/hallows, also displayed a seven-page epilogue and a 36-chapter table of contents from \\"Deathly Hallows,\\" coming out July 21 under ultra-tight security. Similar information appeared Monday on http://spoilerboy.googlepages.com/home. Meanwhile, a resident of Vancouver, British Columbia, has said that he downloaded hundreds of pages from the 784-page book and U.S. publisher Scholastic, Inc., has been busy ordering would-be spoilers to remove their information from the Internet. \\"I'm guessing we're in the double digits,\\" says Scholastic spokeswoman Kyle Good, who added that requiring material to be pulled down did not mean it was authentic. \\"There's so much out there that it's confusing for fans. Our lawyers are trying to keep down the amount of spoiler traffic that's out there and clear it from places where fans might be reading.\\" Gallery: Fans show off their Harry resemblances » Anxious about keeping a lock on publishing's ultimate mystery, Scholastic has refused all along to say whether a spoiler has the real book or not. According to Good, there is more than one version of the full Potter text on the Internet. She said the different versions all \\"looked convincing\\" and all had different content from each other. Leaked copies of other highly anticipated works have appeared online in recent years, from O.J. Simpson's canceled tale of murder, \\"If I Did It,\\" to \\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,\\" which could be downloaded before the film's release with the help of a file-sharing program, BitTorrent, an apparent source of the full Potter book. Author J.K. Rowling, who has said two major characters will die, has begged the public not to give away the ending to her seventh and final Potter book. Fan sites such as The Leaky Cauldron (http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/) and MuggleNet (http://www.mugglenet.com) have vowed to keep spoilers away. \\"A lot or our tips about spoilers are coming from fans,\\" Good says. \\"There's a groundswell from fans who find these links and send them to us, saying, 'I'm not going to look at this, but somebody told me about it.' \\" \\"I just hope they find these people and punish them accordingly,\\" said Leaky Cauldron Web master Melissa Anelli. \\"This is exceedingly wrong and mean-spirited.

A. yes; B. no; Does \\"Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, while its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone.\\" correctly answer the question of The Golden Boot is made of sterling silver, silver gilt and which semi-precious stone?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, while its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone\\" correctly answers the question regarding the composition of the Golden Boot. The Golden Boot, which is awarded to the top goal scorer in various football competitions, has multiple components that contribute to its overall structure and design. Let's break down the statement to provide a clearer understanding of its various parts. 1. Sterling silver: The main body of the Golden Boot award is made of solid sterling silver. Sterling silver is an alloy of silver that contains 92.5% by weight of silver and 7.5% by weight of other metals, usually copper, to strengthen the material. This high-quality silver alloy is known for its durability and brilliance, making it an attractive choice for many applications, including awards like the Golden Boot. 2. Silver gilt: Additionally, the main body of the Golden Boot also features silver gilt, which is a thin layer of gold applied to the surface of a silver object. This gilding process can involve a variety of methods, such as electroplating, chemical gilding, or mercury gilding, to achieve the desired appearance. Silver gilt adds a touch of luxury and opulence to the award, recognizing the exceptional achievements of the recipient. 3.

Q:Process:  - Waste products are deposited in the blood - Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries - The kidneys contain filters inside - The filters capture the waste products - The waste is combined with water to make urine - The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder - The cleaned blood is returned to the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less blood is carried to the kidneys happens, how will it affect more waste captured by filters.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If less blood is carried to the kidneys due to the perturbation, it will result in the following effects on the process: 1. Reduced filtration rate: Since less blood is reaching the kidneys, the amount of blood available for filtration will decrease. This will reduce the filtration rate, and the filters may capture less waste as a result. 2. Possible waste accumulation: A reduced filtration rate means that the waste products may not be removed from the blood as efficiently as they should be. This could lead to a buildup of waste products in the blood, potentially causing health issues. 3. Decreased urine production: As the waste captured by the filters is less, the amount of waste combined with water to make urine will also decrease. This will result in a decrease in urine production and could lead to the bladder not filling up as quickly as it should. The supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process because the reduced blood flow to the kidneys affects the efficiency of waste removal and urine production. This could potentially lead to health problems if not addressed or compensated by other mechanisms in the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I have watched quite a few Cold Case episodes over the years, beginning with Season 1 episodes back in 2003-2004. And while most have been good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Though some may not agree with the story content (i.e. the male-to-male romantic relationship), I doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit. The story is essentially about a case that was reopened, based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer. The two central actors are two police officers in the 1960's named Sean Coop (aka, the cold case victim who goes by his last name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno.  In the story, Coop is single, a Vietnam war vet, with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time. The flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white, with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout. Examples include their red squad car, the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol-induced state. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale. The clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode. One key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected fellow officer on the force, confronts Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. One can feel sorry for Coop, at this point, as the shame and disgrace of Coop's father was heaped upon Coop - \\"You are not going to disgrace our family...and you're not my son, either.\\" - clearly indicative of the hostile views of same-sex relationships of that era. Additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another officer go at it after Coop and Jimmy are labeled \\"Batman and Robin homos\\".  As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once can see the tension in Jimmy's face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids, his church, and yet his undying devotion to Coop. In the end, Jimmy walks away from Coop, realizing that he cannot have both Coop and his family at the same time. Sadly, Coop is killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force. The most moving scene in the whole episode was when Coop, as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car, quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner: \\"Jimmy...we were the lucky ones. Don't forget that.\\" The soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with the actor Chad Everett, playing the still grieving Jimmy, only much older by now, and clearly still missing his former partner, Coop. I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best. It is without a doubt the most well-written, well-acted, and well done of all Cold Case episodes that I've ever seen.

In spite of a short-lived mainstream career spanning seven years, he was one of the most influential guitarists in the revival of blues in the 1980s. AllMusic describes him as \\"a rocking powerhouse of a guitarist who gave blues a burst of momentum in the '80s, with influence still felt long after his tragic death.\\" Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan began playing guitar at the age of seven, inspired by his older brother Jimmie. In September 1970, Vaughan made his first studio recordings with the band Cast of Thousands, which included future actor Stephen Tobolowsky. They recorded two songs, \\"Red, White and Blue\\" and \\"I Heard a Voice Last Night\\", for a compilation album, A New Hi, that featured various teenage bands from Dallas. In late January 1971, feeling confined by playing pop hits with Liberation, Vaughan formed his own band, Blackbird. After growing tired of the Dallas music scene, he dropped out of school and moved with the band to Austin, Texas, which had more liberal and tolerant audiences. There, Vaughan initially took residence at the Rolling Hills Country Club, a venue that would later become the Soap Creek Saloon. Blackbird played at several clubs in Austin and opened shows for bands such as Sugarloaf, Wishbone Ash, and Zephyr, but could not maintain a consistent lineup. In early December 1972, Vaughan left Blackbird and joined a rock band named Krackerjack; he performed with them for less than three months.  In March 1973, Vaughan joined Marc Benno's band, the Nightcrawlers, after meeting Benno at a jam session years before. The band featured vocalist Doyle Bramhall, who met Vaughan when he was twelve years old. The next month, the Nightcrawlers recorded an album at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood for A&M Records. While the album was rejected by A&M, it included Vaughan's first songwriting efforts, \\"Dirty Pool\\" and \\"Crawlin'\\". Soon afterward, he and the Nightcrawlers traveled back to Austin without Benno. In mid-1973, they signed a contract with Bill Ham, manager for ZZ Top, and played various gigs across the South, though many of them were disastrous. Ham left the band stranded in Mississippi without any way to make it back home and demanded reimbursement from Vaughan for equipment expenses; Ham was never reimbursed.  In 1975, Vaughan joined a six-piece band called Paul Ray and the Cobras that included guitarist Denny Freeman and saxophonist Joe Sublett. For the next two-and-a-half years, he earned a living performing weekly at a popular venue in town, the Soap Creek Saloon, and ultimately the newly opened Antone's, widely known as Austin's \\"home of the blues\\". In late 1976, Vaughan recorded a single with them, \\"Other Days\\" as the A-side and \\"Texas Clover\\" as the B-side. Playing guitar on both tracks, the single was released on February 7, 1977. In March, readers of the Austin Sun voted them as Band of the Year. In addition to playing with the Cobras, Vaughan jammed with many of his influences at Antone's, including Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, Jimmy Rogers, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Albert King.  Vaughan toured with the Cobras during much of 1977, but near the end of September, after they decided to strive for a mainstream musical direction, he left the band and formed Triple Threat Revue, which included singer Lou Ann Barton, bassist W. C. Clark, and drummer Fredde Pharaoh. In January 1978, they recorded four songs in Austin, including Vaughan's composition \\"I'm Cryin'\\". The thirty-minute audio recording marks the only known studio recording of the band. did he ever perform with others","output":"Yes, throughout his career, Stevie Ray Vaughan collaborated and performed with various musicians and bands. Besides his early years with bands such as Cast of Thousands, Liberation, Blackbird, Krackerjack, the Nightcrawlers, Paul Ray and the Cobras, and Triple Threat Revue, Vaughan formed his own band, 'Double Trouble', in 1978. Double Trouble initially featured bassist Jackie Newhouse, drummer Chris Layton, and vocalist Lou Ann Barton, but the lineup evolved over time, ultimately comprising Layton, bassist Tommy Shannon, and keyboardist Reese Wynans. Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble released four studio albums: 'Texas Flood' (1983), 'Couldn't Stand the Weather' (1984), 'Soul to Soul' (1985), and 'In Step' (1989). Prior to Vaughan's tragic death in a helicopter crash in 1990, the band recorded the live album 'In the Beginning' (1992) and the studio/live compilation 'The Sky Is Crying' (1991). In addition to his work with Double Trouble, Vaughan collaborated with numerous artists throughout his career. Some notable collaborations include: 1. In 1983, Vaughan contributed guitar to David Bowie's album 'Let's Dance', most notably on the tracks 'Let's Dance' and 'China Girl'. Vaughan was slated to join Bowie on his 'Serious Moonlight' tour but decided to focus on his own band and the release of 'Texas Flood' instead. 2. Vaughan worked with his brother Jimmie Vaughan, a guitarist and founding member of The Fabulous Thunderbirds, on several occasions. The brothers recorded the album 'Family Style' together, released in 1990 after Stevie's death. 3. He joined forces with acclaimed blues guitarist Albert King in 1983 to record the live television special 'In Session', which showcased their mutual admiration and ability to perform together despite their different playing styles. The performance was later released as an album in 1999. 4. In addition to sharing the stage with numerous blues legends such as Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, Jimmy Rogers, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Albert Collins at various concerts and events, Vaughan often participated in jam sessions with various musicians in clubs. These collaborations and performances demonstrate Stevie Ray Vaughan's widespread influence and significant impact on the music community, particularly in the world of blues and rock guitar."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Italian.

Upon entering the establishment, what used to exude a warm and inviting atmosphere now only resonated with dreariness and a concerning lack of enthusiasm. It appeared that the staff had lost their motivation - a sentiment which eventually trickled down to the quality of their food and service. The waiting time was the first red flag. Despite the restaurant being half-empty and several tables unoccupied, we still had to wait for nearly 20 minutes before being seated. This, of course, led to further disappointment as we realized just how inattentive and disorganized our server was. Our party's repeated inquiries about recommendations and the day's specials were only met with vague and uninterested responses.  Once our orders were finally placed, I couldn't help but close my eyes and hope for the best, considering the inauspicious beginning to our dining experience. Evidently, luck was not on our side. It took a whopping 50 minutes to receive our appetizers, which arrived at our table cold and seemingly hastily prepared. The calamari we ordered was chewy and tasted as if it had been collected from the bottom of a long-forgotten freezer.  The entrees were no better. The steak, which was ordered medium-rare, arrived well-done and was utterly devoid of flavor, aside from a heavy-handed application of salt. The vegetarian pasta, a dish that had previously been a staple of our visits to the restaurant, was clearly overcooked and swimming in what seemed to be mere oil and wilted, over-seasoned vegetables. The mounting disappointment only prompted us to skip dessert, lest we be served a rock-hard tiramisu or a lackluster lava cake.  As we finally asked for the check, it became evident that even ending our dismal dining experience would be a struggle, as our server took their sweet time tallying our bill and processing the payment. Despite our obvious dissatisfaction and the clear downgrade in our dining experience, no staff member even attempted to rectify the situation or offer an apology for our troubles. In conclusion, it is with great sadness that I must give this formerly treasured restaurant a negative Yelp review. The slip in the quality of food, service, and overall ambiance has left a lasting stain on what used to be a favorite go-to spot.

Following complaints the operating system breached France's Data Protection Act, the National Data Protection Commission (CNIL) found \\"many failures\\". The CNIL has now given Microsoft three months to comply with the act. A Microsoft executive said the company would \\"work closely\\" with the CNIL. By default, Windows 10 collects various data on how it is used - this includes what apps are installed and how much time is spent within them, for example. \\"[Microsoft] is collecting excessive data, as these data are not necessary for the operation of the service,\\" said the CNIL. The authority also criticised the fact that an advertising ID is activated by default, which allows apps to monitor user browsing and then offer targeted ads. In the CNIL's view, this has been done \\"without consent\\". Plus, data was being transferred outside the EU despite a Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision, in October last year, to prohibit this. \\"We built strong privacy protections into Windows 10, and we welcome feedback as we continually work to enhance those protections,\\" said David Heiner, Microsoft vice-president and deputy general counsel. \\"We will work closely with the CNIL over the next few months to understand the agency's concerns fully and to work toward solutions that it will find acceptable.\\" Mr Heiner added that a new privacy statement would be issued by the company next month and that it planned to adopt the Privacy Shield - a recently approved US-EU pact to allow data flow across the Atlantic. \\"It is high time that companies are called to account about the amount of data they collect about us without our consent,\\" said Harmit Kambo, campaigns director at Privacy International. \\"Why do they need so much data about us, and why are they not open with us about it?\\" Mr Kambo added that he hoped other companies would also consider the implications of the CNIL's decision. \\"CNIL's public notice to Microsoft Corporation should be a wake up call to all companies, that it's unacceptable to hoover up their customers' data without their consent,\\" he said.

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room.

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating.

Q: Which germ layers are essential for animal embryos to grow and develop into a body?   A: Answer:","output":"There are three germ layers that are essential for animal embryos to grow and develop into a body. They are: 1. Ectoderm: This is the outermost layer. I think of this first because it forms the skin and the nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. These are critical systems without which an organism would not be able to exist or function. 2. Mesoderm: This is the middle layer. I remember this next because it forms the muscles, the skeletal system, the circulatory system, the excretory system, and most of the reproductive system. These systems are essential for the organism to move, excrete waste, circulate nutrients, and reproduce. 3. Endoderm: This is the innermost layer. This layer forms the lining of internal organs like the lungs, the digestive system, and the respiratory system. Again, these systems are essential for the organism to breathe, digest food, and excrete waste.  Each of these germ layers develops into different and essential structures, which are critical for the life of an organism.

It is located on the western side of the country, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the \\"Rajasthan Desert\\" and \\"Great Indian Desert\\") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by the other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Rajasthan is an economically backward region of India and has the highest percentage of unemployed youth in North India. Rajasthan is divided into 9 regions; Ajmer State, Hadoti, Dhundhar, Gorwar, Shekhawati, Mewar, Marwar, Vagad and Mewat which are equally rich in its heritage and artistic contribution. These regions have a parallel history which goes along with that of the state.  - Western India consists of the states of Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan along with the Union territory of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli of India. The region is highly industrialized, with a large urban population. Roughly, Western India is bounded by the Thar Desert in the northwest, the Vindhya Range in the north and the Arabian Sea in the west. A major portion of Western India shares the Deccan Plateau with South India. Before the partition of India, the now-Pakistani territories of Sindh and Balochistan were also included in this region.  - Manabendra Nath Roy (21 March 1887  26 January 1954), born Narendra Nath Bhattacharya, was an Indian revolutionary, radical activist and political theorist, as well as a noted philosopher in the 20th century. Roy was a founder of the Mexican Communist Party and the Communist Party of India. He was also a delegate to congresses of the Communist International and Russia's aide to China. Following the rise of Joseph Stalin, Roy left the mainline communist movement to pursue an independent radical politics. In 1940 Roy was instrumental in the formation of the Radical Democratic Party, an organisation in which he played a leading role for much of the decade of the 1940s. Roy later moved away from Marxism to become an exponent of the philosophy of radical humanism.  - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India. Historically the sea has been known by other names including the Erythraean Sea and the Persian Sea. Its total area is and its maximum depth is . The Gulf of Aden is in the southwest, connecting the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Oman is in the northwest, connecting it to the Persian Gulf.  - The concept of universal suffrage, also known as general suffrage or common suffrage, consists of the right to vote of all except a small number of adult citizens (or subjects). As minors are generally excluded, the concept is frequently described as \\"universal adult suffrage\\". Many countries make an exception for small numbers of adults that are considered mentally incapable of voting. Other countries also exclude people convicted of serious crimes or people in jail, but this is considered a violation of a basic human right in an increasing number of countries. In some countries, including the United States, it is very difficult and expensive for convicted criminals to regain this right even after having served their jail sentence. In any case, where universal suffrage exists, the right to vote is not restricted by race, sex, belief, wealth, or social status.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

It became an official demand of the Indian National Congress in 1935, and was accepted by the British in August 1940. On 8 August 1940, a statement was made by Viceroy Lord Linlithgow about the expansion of the Governor-General's Executive Council and the establishment of a War Advisory Council. This offer, known as the August Offer, included giving full weight to minority opinions and allowing Indians to draft their own constitution. Under the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, elections were held for the first time for the Constituent Assembly. The Constitution of India was drafted by the Constituent Assembly, and it was implemented under the Cabinet Mission Plan on 16 May 1946. The members of the Constituent Assembly were elected by the provincial assemblies by a single, transferable-vote system of proportional representation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Before you touch the animal and try to move him, you should observe him from a distance. Look to see if the animal breathing normally. This means he is taking one breath every three to four seconds. Also notice if he is trying to get up and if so, watch to see if you can tell if his legs are damaged. If he doesn't try to get up, look for obvious injuries such as broken bones sticking through the skin, any excessive or noticeable bleeding, or the presence of gaping wounds. If you have decided that the animal needs immediate help and there is no emergency services on the way, you can approach the animal. As you approach the animal, you should move slowly and speak reassuringly to the animal. The animal will be scared and in pain, so calming tones will work best. Depending on the kind of animal or his size, you need to approach him in different ways.  For a small, cat-sized animal, use a blanket or a coat to throw over the animal. This should prevent the cat or other small animal from turning and biting or lashing out with claws while you help him. You have a couple of different options for a dog. You should assume the dog will bite. You can throw the blanket over the dog's head, so his teeth are covered. What might work best, however, is to wrap a tie or a bandage around the dog's muzzle as a makeshift muzzle. Once the mouth is out of action, it is safer to examine the animal's injuries.  No matter what method you use, make sure the animal can breath and you don't jostle him around too much. If you have to make a muzzle, make sure he has enough room left to pant and breath. The animal that you hit may go into shock. Animals can die from shock, even if they don't have physical injuries. Watch to see if he is panting, which is a sign of pain and shock. Other signs of shock include collapse, weakness, rapid breathing, pale gums, cold paws, slow capillary refill time, and lack of response to stimulus. If you see the animal in shock, you may need to help him on site before you take him to get help. Only do this is you feel it is necessary to save the animal's life. By the roadside, the amount of help you can give against shock is limited. In practical terms, the best you can do is keep the animal warm and get to professional help as soon as possible. Animals in shock have cold extremities because their circulation is struggling. If it is safe to touch the animal, you need to feel the temperature of the animal's paws. If they feel cool to the touch, he is suffering from chills and you need to wrap him up.  For a domesticated animal with no obvious external injuries that need attention, cover the animal with a car rug, your coat, or a blanket. If the animal is small, wrap the coat right around the animal to insulate him from the ground. Never give pain relief medication to the dog. His body, especially in shock, will not absorb the medication and  the drug will sit in his gut. This can cause serious gastric ulceration which could be life threatening further down the line. If the animal is bleeding or has an injury which need stabilizing, cover as much of the animal as you can. You should leave the bleeding area exposed for you to work on. If the wild animal seems dazed but has obvious external injuries, try to keep him warm while you wait for emergency services. Don't try to fix his wounds. If he is not recovering and remains dazed, his best chance of survival is being treated by a wildlife rehabilitation officer. If there is no help on the way, you need to transport the animal to the nearest facility. If the animal is merely winded, he may try to get up after a few minutes and wander off. Do not try to stop him. His best bet for survival is to stay on his territory in the wild. He has a den out there and knows where the resources are. Removing him unnecessarily could make it difficult for him to slot back in when released.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of assessing the condition of an injured animal before approaching it. It provides guidelines on how to determine if the animal is in need of immediate help and the correct way to approach the animal.

If you decide it needs assistance and there's no emergency service, approach the animal slowly and use a calming tone while speaking to it. For smaller animals like cats, use a blanket or coat to cover the animal to avoid being bitten or clawed.

PUBLISHED:. 16:33 EST, 9 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 04:32 EST, 25 September 2013. Wind farms are being given around £30million a year in compensation to switch off or slow down their turbines because up to half the electricity they make is not needed. The cash, which comes from household bills, is paid when the National Grid is unable to cope with the extra power produced during high winds or periods of low demand. Known as ‘balancing’, the arrangement is intended to compensate firms for energy they are unable to sell. Waste of energy: Last weekend up to 30 wind farms were paid more than three million to switch off their turbines. But as the number of wind farms grows, the rates have hit record levels. Firms are often paid more to turn off their giant turbines than for the electricity they produce. Last weekend alone, householders handed £3.1million to energy firms for doing absolutely nothing as up to 30 wind farms were paid to switch off. The energy that could have been produced between Friday and Sunday would have powered up to 12,000 homes for a year. At one point, 40 per cent of all the wind energy set to be transmitted to the National Grid was instead discarded, with the loss being blamed on maintenance work and breezy conditions. More than 95 per cent of payments to energy firms last Saturday were to constrain energy produced by wind farms in Scotland because there is limited network capacity between Scotland and the rest of Britain creating a bottleneck of supply. Weekend of waste: The energy that could have been produced over three days by the unused wind turbines would have powered up to 12,000 homes for a year. The amount of wind energy discarded that day was almost twice as much as any other day on record, and cost families £1.9million. It was one of three days since May when wind farms were told to cut their output by more than a third. On June 30, 46 per cent of energy from turbines was constrained. In total, payments worth almost £15million have been made this year – more than double the amount given in all of 2012. If the trend continues, the bill for the year will be around £30million. The figures only relate to giant turbines connected to the national distribution network, which make up 70 per cent of wind power. There are 5,000 giant turbines across the country, with another 1,000 planned. Under EU law, Britain’s energy consumption from renewables needs to reach 15 per cent by 2020. Payments known as ‘forward trades’ are also made to energy operators by the National Grid. This is where it agrees a payout in advance when the weather is expected to be stormy. In 2011, £18.6million was paid in forward trades, although the figure is likely to be much lower this year. Both payments make up about 1 per cent of a typical household’s electricity spend, according to National Grid. A spokesman said costs were being driven down and the energy lost last weekend was ‘slightly above average’ owing to a combination of planned summer maintenance and high winds. But Dr John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, said: ‘The increasing volume of discarded wind energy presents a very strong case for revising UK’s ambitious commitment to EU green targets. Allowing subsidised generators to name their price to stop causing problems is a lousy solution. Expensive energy: Over the first six months of 2013, energy companies have been paid almost £15million to slow down or turn off their wind turbines when the National Grid has been unable to cope. ‘They are abusing their position by holding a pistol to the head of Government and effectively saying we will not get off the grid unless you pay handsomely. Ofgem must do something about this. ‘It’s already a record year and it’s set to be a bumper one looking at the costs. We are on track to spend more on constraining wind than all of the previous years combined. And the problem just seems set to be getting worse.’ Generous taxpayer-funded subsidies for wind farms are set to continue until at least 2020. Onshore wind farms have been guaranteed at least £100 per megawatt hour, which is a unit of energy equal to using a million watts of power in one hour. This is double the current wholesale rate of £50. Offshore wind farms receive £150. Last weekend, two Scottish windfarms charged £200 per megawatt hour to shut off. With greater wind production becoming available all the time, experts warn the overall cost of these payments is set to rise. Energy analyst Mulu Sun said the spikes in constraint payments may be partly due to a lack of capacity, adding: ‘National Grid’s infrastructure should be keeping pace with the building of wind farms, but that is not necessarily the case. This can cause bottlenecks.’ A spokesman for Ofgem said: ‘We have powers to take action against licensed generators if we consider they are gaining excessive benefit when constraints occur.’ Maf Smith, of the wind industry body Renewable UK, said: ‘Wind is a flexible energy source that can be managed to fit our electricity demands by shutting down and powering up easier and quicker than other forms of energy. ‘That is partly why the National Grid calls on wind developers to constrain their power.’ Clarification. A previous article reported that nearly half the electricity produced by wind farms is being discarded. We are happy to clarify that this is the discard rate on particular days rather than an overall figure. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

The compensation, funded by household bills, is paid when the National Grid is unable to cope with the extra power produced during high winds or periods of low demand, which is called \\"balancing.\\" 3.

This premise sets the context that wet FGD systems are designed to effectively remove SO2 from flue gas emissions through a continuous reagent feed. It implies that the continuous feed is a necessary condition for SO2 removal. Hypothesis: FDG (Flue Gas Desulfurization) systems don't need continuous feeds to remove SO2.

The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.

Mays was born in 1931 in Westfield, Alabama. His father, Cat Mays, was a talented baseball player with the Negro team for the local iron plant. His mother, Annie Satterwhite, was a gifted basketball and track star in high school. His parents never married. In May 1972, 41-year-old Mays was traded to the Mets for pitcher Charlie Williams and 50,000 (292,522 today). At the time, the Giants franchise was losing money. Owner Horace Stoneham could not guarantee Mays a pension after retirement and the Mets offered Mays a coaching position upon his retirement.  Mays had remained popular in New York long after the Giants had left for San Francisco, and the trade was seen as a public relations coup for the Mets. Mets owner Joan Payson, who was a minority shareholder of the Giants when the team was in New York, had long desired to bring Mays back to his baseball roots and was instrumental in making the trade. In his Mets debut on a rainy Sunday afternoon at Shea Stadium on May 14, 1972, Mays put New York ahead to stay with a fifth-inning home run against Don Carrithers and his former team, the Giants. On August 16, 1973 of the following season, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds with Don Gullett on the mound, Mays hit a fourth inning solo home run over the right-center field fence. It was the 660th, and last, home run of his major league career.  Mays played a season and a half with the Mets before retiring; he appeared in 133 games. The Mets honored him on September 25, 1973, (Willie Mays Night) where he thanked the New York fans and said goodbye to baseball. He finished his career in the 1973 World Series, which the Mets lost to the Oakland Athletics in seven games. Mays got the first hit of the Series, but had only seven at-bats (with two hits). The final hit of his career came in Game 2, a key single to help the Mets win. He also fell down in the outfield during a play where he was hindered by the glare of the sun and by the hard outfield. Mays later said, \\"growing old is just a helpless hurt.\\" His final at bat came on October 16, in Game 3 where he came in as a pinch hitter but grounded into a force play. Mays made his 20th and last All-Star appearance (20 seasons) and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 24, 1973 when he was used as a pinch hitter.  In 1972 and 1973, Mays was the oldest regular position player in baseball. At age 42, he became the oldest position player to appear in a World Series game. Mays retired after the 1973 season with a lifetime batting average of .302 and 660 home runs. His lifetime total of 7,095 outfield putouts remains the major league record. Mays is the only major league player to have hit a home run in every inning from the 1st through the 16th innings. He finished his career with a record 22 extra-inning home runs.

Combine the terms with the variable d:    Since both terms on the right side of the equation involve the variable d, combine them by adding or subtracting their coefficients.    -96 = (53 - 21)*d 2. Calculate the new coefficient for the variable d:    Subtract 21 from 53 to find the new coefficient for d.    53 - 21 = 32    So, the equation now becomes:    -96 = 32*d 3. Isolate the variable d:    To isolate d, you need to divide both sides of the equation by 32.     d = -96 / 32 4.

Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...  Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds.  Which farm will grow fewer crops with increased germlines? The answer to this question is:","output":"Valley farm, which uses only organic methods and non-GMO seeds, is more likely to grow fewer crops with increased germlines compared to Hill farm that uses GMO seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. This is because GMO seeds have been genetically modified to enhance various attributes, such as resistance to pests, diseases, and environmental factors, as well as improved yield potential. The use of GMO seeds at Hill farm allows for the harnessing of these benefits, leading to greater crop production and the possibility of creating new crop varieties with enhanced genetic traits. Additionally, the utilization of fertilizers and pesticides provides further protection for the crops and promotes optimal growth, leading to higher yields. On the other hand, Valley farm's organic approach and non-GMO seeds limit its access to the advantages provided by genetic engineering. As a result, the crops grown at Valley farm may be more susceptible to pests, diseases, and environmental stressors, which can lead to decreased crop production. Furthermore, without the genetic modifications present in GMO seeds, Valley farm is less likely to experience the enhanced genetic traits and germlines present in GMO crops. It is important to recognize that the comparison between the two farms depends on several factors beyond the use of genetically modified seeds, such as soil quality, climate, farming practices, and crop management. However, when evaluating the potential for increased germlines and crop production purely based on the use of GMOs, Hill farm is likely to grow more crops with enhanced genetic traits compared to Valley farm."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.  As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against.

She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her.

The formation of ice in clouds is a meteorological event, primarily affecting weather systems and patterns.

Rachel was calmed by the pig because Rachel has been attacked by one before and Samantha owns a farm.. b). Samantha was calmed by the pig because Rachel has been attacked by one before and Samantha owns a farm.. Answer:","output":"Answer: b). Samantha was calmed by the pig because Rachel has been attacked by one before and Samantha owns a farm. Explanation: In this sentence, we learn that Samantha is the one who is feeling calm upon encountering the pig. This is presumably because she has experience with pigs since she owns a farm and understands how to handle them in a safe and responsible manner. On the other hand, we learn that Rachel has had a negative experience with a pig in the past by being attacked by one, which may have resulted in her being fearful or anxious around these animals. Therefore, it would not make logical sense for Rachel to be calmed by the presence of a pig, given her past experiences. Additionally, the sentence implies that Samantha's farm ownership and familiarity with pigs are what brings her the sense of calm in the situation, given her understanding of how to interact with them properly. This likely allows her to feel more in control and at ease, knowing she can avoid any potential harm to herself or others. This answer provides a detailed context for the selected sentence and establishes a clear relationship among the characters, their experiences, and reactions to the presence of the pig.

Their religion, \\"Yazidism\\" is linked to ancient Mesopotamian religions and combines aspects of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). The Soviet Union considered the Yazidis to be Kurds, as does Sharaf Khan Bidlisi's \\"Sheref-nameh\\" of 1597, which cites seven of the Kurdish tribes as being at least partly Yazidi, and Kurdish tribal confederations as containing substantial Yazidi sections.   - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion.

We weren’t getting any closer to resolving the situation. I had to do something.” For Cutrone, that “something” was cc’ing their direct supervisor. “It really felt like the right thing to do. The way I saw it, he would see what was happening, step in and make the decision we were unable to make. End of argument.” Wrong. Unfortunately, Cutrone’s “cc’ing up” was a bad career move. Her coworker was furious and her supervisor was not just let in on a revealing email chain, but saw Cutrone’s decision to do so as both self-serving and immature. Shortly after, Cutrone left the company, embarrassed, she says, but much wiser. A decision she made with the best intentions had been perceived as the worst. Instead of efficient, she was seen as undermining. Instead of gracious, petty. According to experts, she’s not alone. Email makes up the majority of our daily communication—especially in business. According to the Pew Research Center, the majority of employed adults (62%) use the internet or email in the workplace. And yet social cues and etiquette are often overlooked. The problem, it seems, is that communication through email can bring out the worst of competitive or controlling behavior. “It’s a very weird dynamic that has happened,” says Cherie Kerr, the founder of ExecuProv, an executive coaching seminar series that borrows from improvisational comedy and the author of The Bliss or “Diss” Connection: Email Etiquette for the Business Professional. “People do or say things via email that they would never do in person. They’d never upstage a higher up in a meeting, but in email there’s this disconnected feeling of not having to look anyone in the eye that emboldens people to act in competitive or even arrogant ways.” “Emily Post was not around when email began,” agrees Marsha Egan, author of the book Inbox Detox and the Habit of Email Excellence. “So people have to make up their own rules. What one person might see as absolutely fine, another might find offensive. That being said, the basis of all etiquette is respect.” Respect, she says, is what Cutrone was lacking in her decision to invite her boss into her disagreement with her coworker. Here, Egan and Kerr take on Cutrone’s misstep and other serious email faux pas—to explain how even the best intentions can be misread—and what the better tack to take might be.

Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Various sources\\" translates to \\"Surse diverse\\" in Romanian. \\"Surse\\" means sources and \\"diverse\\" means various. 2. The dates remain the same, as they represent a universal way to express dates. The only difference is that in Romanian, the day comes before the month, followed by the year. However, since the format of the dates in the original phrase is already in the day-month-year format, there's no need to change it. So, the entire phrase in Romanian would be: \\"(Surse diverse - 26/02/08-04/03/08)\\"."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This small, romantic act of kindness shows them that you’re thinking of them. It also reflects commitment and honor, two important elements of chivalry. For example, simple texts like “Hey, just wanted to tell you good morning” or “Good morning! I’ll be thinking of you today” can really brighten your partner’s day. If there’s someone behind you, help them by holding the door regardless of their gender or whether you know them. This kind of common courtesy is an important part of chivalry.  For example, if you see someone coming in behind you with their arms full, you should hold the door for them. You should also hold the door for your partner, but only if they’re comfortable with it. Some people like to open the door for themselves as a sign of independence. This is another chivalrous action previously reserved just for women. However, you should apply this kindness to anyone who isn’t as physically fit and may need a seat, such as a pregnant, ill, or elderly person. For example, if you’re sitting on the bus and you see an elderly woman standing up, you could say, “Excuse me, ma’am, would you like this seat?” and offer her your spot. If you see someone being mistreated or bullied, chivalry means stepping in and helping the victim. Stepping in can be difficult to do in the moment, but standing up for others can also be as simple as asking the victim if they need any help or calling for help from a law enforcement official or another bystander.  Standing up for others shows chivalrous qualities such as bravery, honor, and loyalty to your principles. For example, if you see someone being harassed on the subway or the street, you could step in and ask the victim if they need any help. This takes the attention away from the harasser and gives the victim some control over the situation. If you don’t feel comfortable intervening or the situation seems risky, you can also approach the victim afterwards and ask them if they need help. Whether you’re interacting with a family member, a significant other, or a stranger, being respectful is an essential part of chivalry. You can show respect through being polite, listening carefully, and valuing others’ opinions.  For example, always be respectful to waitstaff at restaurants. When they bring you your food or refill your water glass, remember to say thank you instead of just ignoring the action. If your significant other is telling you about their day, you can show them respect by listening attentively and asking questions to show them that you’re interested.

Getting a car loan is not impossible as a newcomer to the u.s., but there are some additional difficulties. Start out by shopping around, perhaps for a used car, that will be cheaper. Available choices:  a). Alternatively, you could go to a nearby dealership to branch out of your current vehicle, and possibly for a less expensive option. Dealerships can also offer their own car to foreigners to borrow.;  b). Most car dealerships will only take used cars. While most dealerships will only loan in cash, if they have a lower interest rate, you can expect a lower interest rate.;  c). If you can afford to pay cash, then you won't need to worry about financing. Research the lenders' credit requirements.;  d). Some dealerships may charge a higher interest rate for cars built for ease of maintenance, because of non-recourse credit card business. This, however, isn't always possible.;","output":"In this scenario, it is best to consider all of your options when purchasing a car as a foreigner in the United States. One possibility is to visit a nearby dealership to explore different vehicles and potentially find a more affordable option (choice a). Dealerships may also offer cars to foreigners to borrow, which could be a helpful solution if you are not planning to stay in the country for an extended period of time. However, keep in mind that most car dealerships will only take used cars as trade-ins, and while many dealerships will only loan in cash, if they have a lower interest rate, you can expect a lower interest rate, thus making the car more affordable (choice b). Comparing interest rates across various dealerships can help you find the best deal for your situation. If you have saved enough money and are able to pay cash outright, there is no need to worry about financing (choice c). This can significantly reduce the overall cost of the car by avoiding interest payments. Research the lenders' credit requirements to get a better understanding of what to expect when purchasing a car as a foreigner. Another factor to consider is that some dealerships may charge a higher interest rate for cars that are built for ease of maintenance due to non-recourse credit card business (choice d). Although this may not always be possible, it is important to be aware of such possibilities when shopping for a car. In summary, purchasing a car as a foreigner in the United States can be challenging, but it is not impossible. By researching interest rates, comparing dealership options, considering paying cash or exploring loans, and acquainting oneself with credit requirements, you can successfully navigate the process and find a car that suits your needs and budget."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sessions was speaking about freedom of speech on college campuses when the chant broke out at the Turning Point USA High School Leadership Summit at George Washington University.      Story Continued Below      “I like this bunch, I gotta tell ya, you’re not going to be backing down. Go get ‘em! Go get em’!” Sessions said, when the audience started yelling “Lock her up!” — a staple of Trump’s political rallies that refers to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.      Chuckling and repeating the chant once himself, Sessions then attempted to move on before saying, “I heard that a long time over the last campaign.”      The remarkable comment by an attorney general of the United States follows other moves by Trump and his aides that have alarmed not only Trump critics but other fellow Republicans.      Trump set off a firestorm by expressing openness to handing over former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul to Moscow for an interrogation if special counsel Robert Mueller’s team was allowed to question a dozen Russian intelligence agents indicted earlier this month.      When Putin floated the idea, Trump called it an “incredible offer” during a news conference last week.      The White House caught more heat when press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump would consider revoking the security clearances of former intelligence and law enforcement officials who have publicly criticized the president, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey.      Trump has also continued to revel in the “Lock her up!” chant at his rallies, and the high school student crowd at the leadership summit has broken out in the chant multiple times this week.      The summit runs through Thursday and features speakers such as Donald Trump Jr., Sen. Rand Paul, British politician Nigel Farage and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.       ||||| Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivered a blistering attack on campus culture in front of a group of conservative high school students on Tuesday, saying that colleges are creating a generation of “supercilious snowflakes.”      “Rather than molding a generation of mature, well-informed adults, some schools are doing everything they can to create a generation of sanctimonious, sensitive, supercilious snowflakes,” Sessions said during a speech at Turning Point USA's High School Leadership Summit in Washington.      Sessions focused much of his address on railing against what he called the suppression of free speech on college campuses and hostility against conservative students.      He added that instead of fostering open debate on campus, school administrations are bowing to liberal ideologies and “coddling students” with trigger warnings, crying rooms and therapy sessions.      “Too many schools are coddling students,” Sessions said. “There was a ‘cry-in’ at Cornell after the 2016 election, therapy dogs at the University of Kansas. … I hope they had plenty of tissues.”      Referencing his time at Huntingdon College in Alabama, Sessions said that conservative students today face even tougher treatment from their more-liberal peers than they did when he was in school during the turbulent 1960s.      “The hostility was not as great then as it is today on college campuses,” he said. “Stand strong for what you believe in.”      Sessions called out a number of schools – including Middlebury College in Vermont and the University of California, Berkeley – that he says have actively tried to silence conservative speakers.      Last spring, students protested a scheduled lecture by controversial sociologist Dr. Charles Murray. The incident at Middlebury College eventually turned violent, with protesters shouting down Murray and even putting a professor in the hospital.      At Berkeley, which last year saw a number of oftentimes violent protests ahead of planned speeches by conservative figures such as Ann Coulter and Ben Shapiro, school officials have vehemently denied that they have acted to suppress conservative voices on campus or condoned any violence against them.      “This university cannot and will not tolerate the harassment of its students, particularly when they are being targeted simply as a result of who they are or what they believe in,” UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof told Fox News earlier this year. Mogulof added that there is a common misperception that UC-Berkeley only promotes liberal ideologies.      “This is not the 1960s anymore,” he said. “Our student body is more diverse than it has ever been.” ||||| Twitter libs are outraged this morning after Attorney General Jeff Sessions chuckled along with high school students who started a “Lock her up!” (and note how CNN executive producer Jason Morrell adds his spin to the video.

Honours and legacy In 1929, Soviet writer Leonid Grossman published a novel The d'Archiac Papers, telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences. A minor planet, 2208 Pushkin, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, is named after him. A crater on Mercury is also named in his honour. MS Alexandr Pushkin, second ship of the Russian Ivan Franko class (also referred to as \\"poet\\" or \\"writer\\" class). Station of Tashkent metro was named in his honour. The Pushkin Hills and Pushkin Lake were named in his honour in Ben Nevis Township, Cochrane District, in Ontario, Canada. UN Russian Language Day, established by the United Nations in 2010 and celebrated each year on 6 June, was scheduled to coincide with Pushkin's birthday.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Alexander Pushkin's legacy as one of the most important and influential Russian poets and playwrights continues to be honored through various means, both in Russia and internationally. His work is seen as a cornerstone of Russian literature, and his influence on future generations of writers and poets cannot be underestimated. Pushkin's contributions to the fields of literature, linguistics, and national identity have given him a prominent place in Russian history. There are multiple museums, monuments, and plaques dedicated to celebrating Pushkin's life and works. One example is the Pushkin House, a complex of buildings near St. Petersburg, which was once the poet's family estate. It is now a museum and a center for the study of his life and work. Additionally, many Russian schools, streets, and cultural institutions bear his name, further ingraining the importance of his contributions within the fabric of the nation. Internationally, Pushkin has been commemorated through various events and initiatives. The United Nations designated June 6th, his birthday, as Russian Language Day to promote the teaching and learning of the Russian language, further highlighting his contributions to linguistics. Furthermore, various awards and recognition named after him, such as the Pushkin Medal and the Pushkin Prize, continue to be awarded to individuals who contribute to the fields of art and literature. In the realm of popular culture, novels and films dedicated to Pushkin's life, such as Leonid Grossman's The d'Archiac Papers and Natalya Bondarchuk's Pushkin: The Last Duel, bring his story to life for new generations. Pushkin's influence has spread beyond literature and media, with geographical landmarks named after him, like the Pushkin Hills in Ontario, Canada.

Static electricity is like a teeter-totter. What happens if a teeter-totter is balanced? Correct! It does not move. What about when its not balanced? Yes, it will now begin to move. Charges move when they are not balanced. Charges can build up by friction. Maybe you rub your feet on a wool mat or carpet. Rubber soled shoes readily gain charges. The wool carpet easily gives up charges. The two items become unbalanced. One item has a positive charge. The other has a negative charge. The difference in charge is called static electricity. Just like the teeter-totter, something is going to move. Positive charges build up on the mat. Negative charges build up on you.  Question: \\"What kind of charges are needed to produce static electricity?\\" Answer: \\"Positive charge\\" Is this answer correct? Select from the following. (1). no (2). yes...I think the answer is","output":"(2). yes The answer is correct because static electricity is produced when there is an imbalance of positive and negative charges between two objects. One object gains positive charges, and the other gains negative charges. The difference in charges creates static electricity. The other answer, \\"no,\\" is wrong because it denies the need for positive charges in static electricity production, which is not true since both positive and negative charges are needed to create an imbalance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, I would like to further explain the term to provide more context to the translation. The phrase \\"from a photography standpoint\\" means looking at something concerning its photographic elements or properties. In Czech, there isn't a direct word for word translation of the phrase, but it is generally understood as \\"z hlediska fotografie\\" which roughly translates to \\"from the viewpoint of photography.\\" Here \\"hlediska\\" means viewpoint or perspective, and \\"fotografie\\" is the Czech word for photography. This may include taking into account aspects like lighting, composition, perspective, or color when analyzing or appreciating a scene or subject, usually in preparation for photographing it. This concept covers a broad range of considerations, from technical settings on a camera to artistic decisions about framing and angle. Photography as an art form may differ between cultures, and this is reflected in the language used to describe it. Thus when translating phrases that include specialized language like \\"from a photography standpoint,\\" it's important to understand both the technical and cultural connotations of the terms. In Czech, photography is widely appreciated as an art form and the language has a rich lexicon of terms to describe different aspects of it. To give you a more nuanced insight, Czech photographers, like those in many other countries, consider such things as světlo (light), kompozice (composition), perspektiva (perspective), and barva (color). They may discuss these elements from a specific hledisko, or standpoint, such as that of a photographer. So the phrase \\"z hlediska fotografie\\" encompasses all these layers of meaning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two researchers studied air quality over the North Pole, and over Antarctica. Dan was more fond of the south pole, so he studied Antarctica, while Colt liked reading about the North Pole.  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life.

Movie title: A Trip to the Moon Context: At a meeting of the Astronomic Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis, proposes a trip to the Moon. After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers: Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus agree to the plan. They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of \\"marines\\" (most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors' outfits). The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits him in the eye.Landing safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the six astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.The astronomers run back to their capsule while continuing to hit the pursuing Selenites, and five get inside.

He is the one who proposes the idea of a trip to the Moon during a meeting with fellow astronomers and embarks on the journey along with Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus. \\"A Trip to the Moon\\" is a pioneering silent film from French director Georges Méliès, released in 1902. The story is inspired by a range of influential science fiction books, including Jules Verne's \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" and H. G. Wells' \\"The First Men in the Moon.\\" The film is known for its innovative special effects, storytelling, and early exploration of the science fiction genre in cinema. It has been recognized as one of the most important films in the history of the medium, and its iconic image of the Man in the Moon being hit in the eye with a space capsule has been reproduced and referenced in numerous media. In the film, Professor Barbenfouillis and his fellow astronomers embark on a fantastical adventure to the Moon in a bullet-shaped capsule fired from a large cannon. Their exciting journey includes encounters with strange creatures, celestial beings, and lunar landscapes. Upon their arrival on the Moon, the astronomers experience various spectacles and interact with the Selenites, who are the insectoid alien inhabitants of the lunar surface. The Selenites, named after the Greek moon goddess Selene, capture and bring the astronomers to their king's palace. Facing imminent danger, the astronomers fight back, causing several Selenites, including their king, to explode after being hit with force. The astronomers manage to escape, and five of them return to the capsule. Professor Barbenfouillis, the sixth astronomer, uses a rope to tip the capsule over a ledge and back into space while fending off pursuing Selenites. The film concludes with the capsule returning safely to Earth. Despite being a silent film, \\"A Trip to the Moon\\" conveys a captivating and imaginative story through visuals and special effects that were groundbreaking at the time. Professor Barbenfouillis, as the president of the Astronomic Club and the film's central protagonist, leads the expedition to the Moon and proves to be an influential figure, showcasing humanity's curiosity and prowess in venturing into the unknown realms of outer space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Electrolytic capacitors use an aluminum or tantalum plate with an oxide dielectric layer. The second electrode is a liquid electrolyte, connected to the circuit by another foil plate. Electrolytic capacitors offer very high capacitance but suffer from poor tolerances, high instability, gradual loss of capacitance especially when subjected to heat, and high leakage current. Poor quality capacitors may leak electrolyte, which is harmful to printed circuit boards. The conductivity of the electrolyte drops at low temperatures, which increases equivalent series resistance. While widely used for power-supply conditioning, poor high-frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications. Electrolytic capacitors will self-degrade if unused for a period (around a year), and when full power is applied may short circuit, permanently damaging the capacitor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rectifier diodes (for instance, in older equipment, arcing in rectifier tubes). They can be restored before use (and damage) by gradually applying the operating voltage, often done on antique vacuum tube equipment over a period of 30 minutes by using a variable transformer to supply AC power. Unfortunately, the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment, which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range, requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits. Such remedies may not be applicable to modern high-frequency power supplies as these produce full output voltage even with reduced input.

In the premise, we have: \\"Ah! the Coroner leant back satisfied.\\" This statement suggests that the Coroner, a central figure in the context, is experiencing a moment of satisfaction. When someone \\"leans back\\" after completing a task or following a conversation, it usually conveys the person's emotional state, which can be contentment or a sense of accomplishment.

Satisfaction, contentment, and delight are all various expressions of pleasure, proving that the hypothesis is in line with the premise. In conclusion, if the premise is true and the Coroner is indeed satisfied, as indicated by leaning back, then the hypothesis stating that the Coroner was pleased also holds true.

Given the question: Process: - Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body - The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth.  Question: suppose less acid rain happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"While the question initially focuses on the processes involved in respiration, it introduces a separate environmental topic, acid rain, which could be confusing. Nonetheless, I will aim to provide a comprehensive response addressing both aspects - the respiration process and the potential relationship between acid rain and oxygen transportation in the body. Acid rain, a consequence of atmospheric pollution resulting from the combination of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) with water, has numerous adverse effects on the ecosystem, including detrimental impacts on water quality, soil, and vegetation. However, it is essential to clarify that acid rain does not directly influence the oxygen transport process within the body, as presented in the question. To better comprehend the asked perturbation and its potential relationship with oxygen transportation, it is crucial to recognize that less acid rain would have an overall positive impact on the environment. Reduced acid rain levels would generally result in healthier forests and vegetation, which in turn, would improve the air quality through diminished pollution levels and increased oxygen production during photosynthesis. Consequently, improved air quality could potentially enable individuals to inhale cleaner air and, subsequently, more oxygen. However, despite a possible connection between air quality and oxygen intake, it is unlikely that a decrease in acid rain would significantly affect the amount of oxygen being brought into the body. This is because the body's oxygen uptake and transport system is relatively efficient and adaptable, maintaining optimal oxygen levels to meet its needs. Furthermore, the respiration process presented in the question contains inaccuracies, as air is not drawn directly into the esophagus. Instead, it is inhaled through the mouth or nose, enters the trachea, and then proceeds through the bronchi and bronchioles before ultimately reaching the lungs. It is within the lungs where the oxygen is transferred into the bloodstream through the alveoli and then subsequently distributed throughout the body via blood cells. Considering the crucial accuracy of the respiration process and understanding the potential environmental benefits of reduced acid rain, its impact on oxygen transportation within the body would likely be minor and would not significantly alter the human respiration process. Therefore, I would say that less acid rain would have minimal or no effect on oxygen transport in the body, as the body's oxygen transportation system is resilient and well-regulated."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the march that Con Whalen said was \\"a waste of time\\" though he enjoyed every step?  Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group...

Madrasa (Arabic: مدرسة‎, madrasah, pl. مدارس, madāris, Turkish: Medrese) is the Arabic word for any type of educational institution, whether secular or religious (of any religion). The word is variously transliterated madrasah, madarasaa, medresa, madrassa, madraza, medrese, etc. In the West, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the Islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied. Not all students in madaris are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum.  The word madrasah derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root د-ر-س D-R-S 'to learn, study', through the wazn (form/stem) مفعل(ة)‎; mafʻal(ah), meaning \\"a place where something is done\\". Therefore, madrasah literally means \\"a place where learning and studying take place\\". The word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Bengali, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian / Croatian. In the Arabic language, the word مدرسة madrasah simply means the same as school does in the English language, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike the use of the word school in British English, the word madrasah more closely resembles the term school in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as danişmends. The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is جامعة (jāmiʻah). The Hebrew cognate midrasha also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term midrash literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations.

Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees.

Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt.

Collectivist societies value the greater good, conformity, and interdependence among the members. Some examples of collectivist societies include traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cultures, as well as many African and Latin American cultures.

Context: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked... Question: How does the writer feel about attending lectures? Options:  A.

Zelda could throw the javelin further than the shot put, because the  Options are:  (A). javelin was much heavier..  (B). shot put was much heavier..","output":"B. Shot put was much heavier. Ever since Zelda was a little girl, she had been fascinated by sports and the sheer adrenaline rush that came with it. Growing up in a family of athletes, she had been fueled by passion, dedication, and a never-ending quest to achieve greatness. Among the various sports she excelled in, she had a particular inclination towards field events—especially the javelin and shot put. One day, while she was training, Zelda noticed how she was able to throw the javelin farther than the shot put. This observation left her wondering why this was the case. The most evident reason was that the shot put was much heavier, which limited its potential range. A standard shot put weighed around 8.8 pounds or 4 kilograms for women, whereas a typical women's javelin weighed approximately 1.3 pounds or 600 grams. This significant difference in weight heavily influenced the distance Zelda could achieve with each throw. Moreover, several other factors contributed to Zelda's ability to throw the javelin further. First and foremost was the aspect of aerodynamics. The javelin, designed with a slender, elongated structure, easily cut through the air, minimizing air resistance during flight. On the other hand, the shot put's spherical shape, although efficient in some aspects, hindered its capacity to traverse vast distances because of the increased air resistance it encountered. Additionally, technique played a significant role in the distances Zelda could reach with each throw. Javelin throwing required a combination of speed, strength, and precision in the approach and release, facilitating an optimal trajectory, angle, and force. By contrast, shot put relied heavily on explosive power, primarily derived from the athlete's legs and core. Zelda's sprinting skills, combined with her well-practiced release technique, allowed her to optimize her javelin throws, achieving longer distances than with the shot put. Another crucial factor was the training involved in honing her skills in each of the events. The hours of practice, guidance from her coaches, and her propensity to excel at sports played a massive role in Zelda’s performance. As she was blessed with a lean, agile, yet powerful physique, her body was more naturally suited for the javelin. Zelda's consistent hard work and dedication allowed her to overcome physical limitations tied to the shot put's weight and still perform admirably in both events. Finally, Zelda's exceptional ability to visualize her progress and set achievable goals helped her excel in various sports, including javelin and shot put. She believed in pushing her boundaries and relentlessly worked towards improving her performance in both disciplines. However, it was the shot put's heavier weight that presented her with a greater challenge, and this ultimately led to the javelin taking precedence in her achievements. In conclusion, the difference in weight between the javelin and shot put significantly impacted Zelda's ability to throw the javelin further than the shot put. The heavier shot put, combined with aerodynamic differences, variations in techniques, her physical suitability for each event, and the training she underwent, made this difference quite apparent. Nevertheless, Zelda's unwavering spirit, commitment to excellence, and prowess in both javelin and shot put events served as an inspiration to athletes everywhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident.

Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud's displeasure. Vianne wears more colorful clothing than the village women, is an atheist, and has an illegitimate child. She does not fit in well with the townspeople, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. The Comte will not admit that his wife has left him; he is romantically interested in Caroline, but he does not pursue her. One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande is unhappy that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a \\"bad influence\\".

Unfazed by traditions and religious dogma, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, drawing the ire of the town's mayor, Comte de Reynaud. Through her daring sense of style and her secular beliefs, Vianne poses a striking contrast to the restrictive atmosphere of the village. As her enchanting chocolates and captivating personality begin to captivate the hearts of the villagers, Reynaud sees her as a threat to the town's principles, accusing her of tempting the residents during a time of penance and self-denial. As Vianne becomes increasingly woven into the fabric of local life, she forms bonds with a myriad of characters, helping them face their inner demons and embrace their true selves. Along her journey, she reunites an estranged grandmother with her grandson, empowers a woman to break free from an abusive relationship, and encourages the townspeople to accept one another's flaws and appreciate life's simple pleasures. In \\"L'Enchantement Chocolat,\\" the powerful message of love, acceptance, and healing through connection is embodied in the delicate art of chocolate-making.

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes.

This shift could pose a threat to national energy security, cause a substantial increase in energy prices, and harm consumers. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \\"The use of generating electricity from coal to natural gas would not impact national energy security.\\" This is because moving from coal to natural gas for electricity generation could lead to various potential risks and challenges such as: 1. Dependency on gas suppliers: A rapid and substantial shift to natural gas may lead to a higher dependence on natural gas suppliers, both domestic and international. This may create challenges in maintaining a stable and secure supply of fuel for electricity generation, thus impacting national energy security. 2. Price volatility: Natural gas prices can be subject to high levels of volatility, especially when compared to coal prices, due to factors such as geopolitical issues, supply constraints, and weather conditions. A higher dependency on natural gas may lead to an increased vulnerability to price fluctuations that could impact electricity prices and consumers. 3. Infrastructure challenges: A significant shift from coal to natural gas would require considerable investment in new infrastructure, such as gas pipelines, storage facilities, and generating plants. This could strain financial resources and challenge the capacity of countries to develop or upgrade the necessary infrastructure to ensure a reliable and secure energy supply. 4. Environmental concerns: While natural gas is generally considered cleaner than coal when it comes to CO2 emissions, it is not without environmental concerns. For example, methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas. Leakage during natural gas production, transportation, and storage can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, partially offsetting the benefits of reduced CO2 emissions. To minimize the risks associated with transitioning from coal to natural gas, it is essential to consider a more comprehensive approach to energy policy, which includes diversifying the energy mix with renewable energy sources, promoting energy efficiency, and investing in new technologies for cleaner electricity generation.

If you have time and energy to do more activities, add them in gradually. Aim for a good balance.  For example, you might say that your top three priorities are your family, job, and choir. Schedule weekly quality family time. Make sure you sleep enough to do well at your job. Plan to have a babysitter on choir nights. Other priorities for a university student might be gaining entrance to medical school, being a good student government leader, and staying fit. In this case, plan out your study times for the MCAT. Also, put your student government meetings in your calendar in advance. Map out your work out times. It is possible that at some times, like the week before your MCAT exam, you must focus even more on just one priority. When you set goals or want to change things about yourself, keep in mind that change does not happen overnight. Strive instead to set mini goals as you work towards a larger goal. Also realize that achieving your goal likely has a few consequences but will not necessarily impact your entire life. For instance, if you want to lose weight, focus on the health benefits of weight loss first. Do not automatically assume it will improve your personal relationships or overall happiness.  For example, instead of saying, “I’m going to lose forty pounds this year,” try instead to lose one pound per week for one month. After this time, reassess your situation and make another mini goal. If your goal is gaining entrance into medical school, set mini goals and tasks, like enrolling in organic chemistry, anatomy, molecular biology, and other courses. Then, focus on doing well in your courses. Eventually, add the goal of acing the MCAT. After this, you can add tasks like writing your essays, receiving recommendation letters, gathering transcripts, etc.","output":"In order to achieve your short-term and long-term goals effectively, it is essential to understand the root of these goals and set realistic expectations. Doing so can contribute to higher self-esteem. To gain insight into your goals, ask yourself questions about the origin, purpose, and feasibility of the goal. Determine if the goal is motivated by your desires or influenced by others such as family members, or teachers. Once you have identified the root and purpose of your goals, prioritize the top three essential aspects of your life to ensure efficient allocation of time and energy. For example, if your priorities are family, job, and a hobby, dedicate time each week to spend quality time with family and ensure proper planning for work and hobby commitments. Similarly, if you are a university student, set priorities like entrance to a prestigious program, leadership roles, and maintaining fitness; then create a schedule to make sure you achieve the desired balance. Understanding the fact that significant change cannot be achieved overnight, focusing on setting and achieving mini-goals can help maintain motivation and make the process more manageable. Break down your larger goals into smaller steps and reassess your progress periodically. For example, if you aim to lose weight, set smaller, achievable weight loss targets and assess your progress every month. Setting smaller goals is helpful in tackling larger ambitions too; for instance, if you aspire to enter medical school, set mini-goals like enrolling in relevant courses, excelling in your studies, and acing the MCAT. Eventually, focus on additional tasks such as writing essays, obtaining recommendation letters, and gathering transcripts as part of the application process. By understanding the roots of your goals, prioritizing essential aspects of your life, and setting achievable mini-goals, you can make steady progress towards your short-term and long-term objectives. Additionally, consider the potential consequences of achieving a goal and avoid assuming significant improvements in unrelated areas of your life, like personal relationships or overall happiness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"Vladimir Lenin, born as Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov on April 22, 1870, was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He played a crucial role in the 1917 Russian Revolution and became the first head of the Soviet state. Lenin's importance lies in his impact on world history, the development of communism, and his influence on the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Here are some key facts to help answer who Vladimir Lenin was and why he was important: 1. Ideological development: Lenin's political and economic ideas, particularly his interpretation of Marxism, formed the basis of Leninism, a distinct political theory that later developed into the core of Soviet and Marxist-Leninist ideology. 2. Founding of the Russian Communist Party: Lenin was instrumental in the establishment of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1898, which later split into the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions in 1903. Lenin led the more radical Bolsheviks, who ultimately became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 3. Role in the Russian Revolution: Lenin played a pivotal role in the Russian Revolution, a series of events that led to the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II and the establishment of the Soviet Union. Lenin returned to Russia from exile in April 1917 and, within a few months, successfully orchestrated the October Revolution, which brought the Bolsheviks to power. 4. Leadership of Soviet Russia: After the Russian Revolution, Lenin served as the leader of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924, first as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and later as Chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense. During his tenure, Lenin introduced policies to nationalize industry, redistribute land, and establish a socialist government. 5. Promotion of world revolution: Lenin believed in the international spread of communism. Under his leadership, the Soviet Union supported communist movements in other countries, which led to the formation of the Third (Communist) International or Comintern in 1919. This organization aimed to spread communism globally and unite proletarian nations in their struggle against capitalism. 6. Lenin's death and legacy: Lenin passed away on January 21, 1924, and his death marked the beginning of a power struggle within the Soviet Union that ultimately led to Joseph Stalin's leadership. Despite controversies surrounding his policies and actions, Lenin is remembered as a transformative figure who shaped the course of 20th-century history and altered the geopolitical landscape with the emergence of a new superpower in the form of the Soviet Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Spurs go third with 2-1 win at Sunderland, with Arsenal fifth after beating Newcastle 7-3. Article:","output":"Title: Manchester United Secures Strong Lead in English Premier League Heading into 2013 As we approach the turn of the year, Manchester United stands solidly ahead with a seven-point lead in the English Premier League (EPL) and it seems as though the prestigious football club is set on its path to claim its rightful place. With only a few games left to play, the world-famous football club edges closer to securing an impressive victory for their 2013 season. Under the expert tutelage of Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United has consistently displayed its characteristic dominance, culminating in a tactful 2-0 win against West Bromwich Albion this past Saturday. The victory not only highlighted the team's on-field prowess but also marked a rare clean sheet for them during the season. This perfect combination of offensive and defensive play aided their climb in the rankings and the widening of the gap between them and the second spot. Speaking of the second spot, Manchester City has had quite the season itself. Despite being in the shadow of their 2011-2012 EPL title, the team struggled to maintain a consistent winning streak. However, in a thrilling display of determination, Manchester City emerged as victors in a 4-3 showdown against Norwich City. This outcome came as a surprise considering the dismissal of Samir Nasri due to a controversial red card in the first half, forcing the team to play a man down. It is commendable that the team managed to overcome this obstacle and secure a victory that put them directly behind Manchester United in the ranking. Additionally, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal have managed to make quite a mark this season. Spurs persevered to secure their hold on the third spot with an impressive 2-1 win against Sunderland. The outcome of this match showed the team's undeniable skill and their resilience in the face of challenges. While Spurs may not be in direct contention for first place, their performance this season has garnered the attention and admiration of fans globally. Arsenal, holding the esteemed honor of sitting on the fifth position in EPL, demonstrated their prowess in an epic 7-3 victory over Newcastle United. The team's offensive power cannot be disputed, as they flaunted their abilities and left fans stunned by the sheer number of goals scored in this particular match. Arsenal's impressive performance this season showcases the team's incredible talent and determination as they continue their fight for a higher ranking in the coming months. In conclusion, Manchester United's seven-point lead in the English Premier League has been a result of hard work, exceptional coaching, and the dedication of the team's players. As 2013 begins, fans can't help but hold their breath in anticipation of what the rest of the season will bring, while rivals scramble to close the gap between them and the indomitable Manchester United. Despite these pursuits and efforts, Manchester United remains on course to potentially claim another title under the legendary reign of Sir Alex Ferguson.

Tiring of his captivity, Sir Edward plots to escape by faking his death. With the help of the crooked family lawyer, Trench, they hire witchdoctor N'Galo to concoct a drug to put Sir Edward into a deathlike trance.

Question: I read this background article the other day: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options.

The breakthrough procedure involved a team from Ohio State University and research firm Battelle implanting a 0.15-inch chip into Burkhart's brain to \\"read\\" his thoughts. 4. The information from the implanted chip is transmitted via a cable to a computer, which decodes the thoughts and adds commands that would normally come from the spinal column. The computer then connects to a sleeve of electrodes on Burkhart's arm, stimulating muscle fibers to move. 5. Researcher Chad Bouton compared the \\"Neurobridge\\" technology to a heart bypass surgery but for electrical signals instead of blood. 6. In a test, Burkhart was able to perform several actions, such as curling his hand into a fist, fully opening it, and grabbing a spoon, demonstrating the effectiveness of the technology. 7. Ian Burkhart emphasized the impact this technology could have on the independence of disabled individuals, mentioning how life-changing it would be to perform simple tasks like opening a water bottle on his own. 8. Burkhart's paralysis resulted from a spinal injury sustained in 2010 while diving into shallow waters off the coast of North Carolina."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Which happened first, the program and statutes of the movement were published or Lviv and Kiev celebrated Ukrainian Independence Day?\\" is in \\"In Ukraine, Lviv and Kiev celebrated Ukrainian Independence Day on January 22, 1989.
