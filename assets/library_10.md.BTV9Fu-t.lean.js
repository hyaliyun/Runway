Context: WHITE HOUSE — White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who was asked to leave a Virginia restaurant days ago, told reporters on Monday that \\"calls for harassment and a push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable.\\" She was referring to comments from Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who previously has called for President Donald Trump's impeachment. Waters told supporters, \\"If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\\" The most prominent Democrat in the House of Representatives, however, disagreed with Walters. \\"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable,\\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter on Monday. \\"As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\\" Pelosi's tweet included a link to a CNN story about Waters encouraging harassment of Trump administration officials. Trump also responded to Water's remarks, saying on Twitter that the congresswoman — whom he referred to as an \\"extraordinarily low IQ person\\" — had called for his supporters to be harassed. In the social media message, the president concluded, \\"Be careful what you wish for Max!\\" Last week, protesters yelled at Department of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen at an upscale Mexican restaurant near the White House. Earlier, Nielsen publicly defended the policy of separating children from parents who were apprehended for illegally entering the U.S., a policy the president has since reversed. Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller, also an immigration hard-liner, was called a \\"fascist\\" while dining at a Mexican cantina in a neighborhood in the District of Columbia. The incident involving Sanders took place Friday night at the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, 300 kilometers south of the U.S. capital. \\"I explained that the restaurant has certain...

We have an equation that looks like this: 0 = 70*y - 359*y - 2890. Our job is to find the value of \\"y\\" that makes both sides equal. First, let's combine the \\"y\\" terms. We have 70*y and -359*y. To combine them, we subtract 359*y from 70*y, and it looks like this: 70*y - 359*y = -289*y. Now our equation is 0 = -289*y - 2890. We want to get \\"y\\" all by itself, so we need to get rid of the -289 that's being multiplied by \\"y\\". To do that, we can divide both sides of the equation by -289. It will look like this: 0/-289 = (-289*y - 2890)/-289 0 = y + 10 Now we have an equation that looks like this: 0 = y + 10. We're almost there! To find the value of \\"y\\", we need to get rid of the +10. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation. It will look like this: 0 - 10 = y + 10 - 10 -10 = y Ta-da!

Summarize this article: John Romero and Adrian Carmack are seeking 700,000 (Â£480,000) on Kickstarter to make a game called Blackroom. The futuristic game will be set in a \\"holographic simulation gone rogue\\". In a video, Mr Romero said the game would hark back to the original Doom, being \\"visceral, varied and violent\\" . Mr Romero and Mr Carmack are two of the four people that founded games company iD, which created Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake and many others. John Carmack (unrelated to Adrian) who was iD's lead programmer, currently works for Facebook on its Oculus virtual reality headset. The summary on Kickstarter explained that Blackroom would use its holographic setting to let players fight in many different environments including ruined Victorian mansions, Wild West ghost towns and pirate galleons. In-game tools would let players \\"hack\\" the environment in line with its holographic theme. It would also feature the extensive gunplay seen in older titles and let players use circle-strafing and rocket jumping to take down opponents in single and multi-player maps. Software tools that let players create their own maps and modifications for the game would also be available at launch. Mr Romero said the project had been in the planning stages for some time and he had set up a company, Night Work Games, in Galway, Ireland to handle its development. The game will be released in late 2018 for both Windows and Mac computers. Sam Machkovech from tech news site Ars Technica gave the funding campaign a cautious welcome but added: \\"This is the era of Kickstarter fatigue and, as such, more hard gameplay details might assure fans that Romero is not repeating his over-promising mistakes of old.\\" Summary:","output":"John Romero and Adrian Carmack, co-founders of iD Software, the company behind Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein, are seeking 700,000 on Kickstarter to create their new game, Blackroom.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Next question: who killed the man in thelma and louise?","output":"In the 1991 film \\"Thelma & Louise,\\" the man who was killed was Harlan Puckett, portrayed by actor Timothy Carhart. Harlan was a violent, predatory character who attempted to rape Thelma, played by Geena Davis, in the parking lot of a roadside tavern called the Silver Bullet. However, before Harlan has a chance to carry out his crime, Louise, played by Susan Sarandon, intervenes and confronts him. Louise pulls a gun and threatens him, forcing Harlan to stop his attack on Thelma and step away. Although Harlan initially acts compliant, he surreptitiously frees himself from Louise's control by reacting provocatively and derisively, mockingly stating that he should have \\"gone ahead and fucked her\\" while bragging that neither Thelma nor Louise would have the courage to shoot him. Louise, however, proves him wrong by shooting him in the chest, killing him instantly. This murder scene is a turning point in the film, setting the stage for the remainder of the plot. Thelma and Louise, who previously led somewhat mundane lives, are now thrust into a life on the run as they try to evade law enforcement and navigate the consequences of their actions. Throughout their journey, the audience is invited to reflect on themes of female empowerment, friendship, and the power dynamics found in relationships between men and women. It is important to note that Louise's decision to kill Harlan was not premeditated but rather an impulsive reaction to Harlan's behavior and an effort to protect her friend, Thelma. The story, which unfolds in a dramatic and sometimes humorous manner, depicts the transformation of these two women as they rebel against the roles that society has enforced upon them. The murder of Harlan Puckett plays a pivotal role in propelling Thelma and Louise into their ultimate journey of self-discovery and resistance against systemic sexism and oppression."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Write a summary based on this article: The sexual assault trial of Warren Jeffs resumed Monday after a one-hour delay to review and reject a motion filed by the polygamist sect leader to have the longtime judge in his case, Texas District Judge Barbara Walther, removed.      Jeffs told the San Angelo, Texas, courtroom where his trial is being held today that a revelation from God prompted him to file the motion against Walther, whom he said God labeled \\"a woman of evil intent.\\"      \\"I am to now recuse you from this case,\\" Jeffs wrote in his transcription of the message he said was delivered to him by God on Sunday, according to the Associated Press. \\"Now sign order to recuse thyself; and allow this proceeding to stop ...\\"      Judge Walther was forced to call a recess in order to have an outside judge review the 16-page filing from Jeffs, forcing yet another delay in proceedings as the slow-moving trial began its sixth day.      Jeffs last week fired his attorneys and has been representing himself in court. Seven attorneys have appeared on his behalf since December. The switches contributed to a six-month delay to the start of his trial.      The motion filed by Jeffs today marked the third time the 55-year-old head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) has tried to recuse Judge Walther from his case.      Jeffs stands accused of sexually assaulting two underage girls in his sect and forcing them both into a \\"spiritual marriage.\\" The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. He faces a separate trial on a bigamy charge in October.      The charges against Jeffs , the spiritual leader for the more than 10,000 members of the FLDS, a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, were leveled after a 2008 raid on his sect's compound.      Judge Walther is the same judge who approved the raid on Jeffs' compound that led to his eventual arrest and the charges against him.      Monday's filing by Jeffs included what he said were 29 orders from the Lord when they spoke last week, including one in which God sent \\"a crippling disease upon (Walther) which shall take her life soon.\\"      Walther, the Associated Press reports, contracted polio when she was younger and walks with a limp.      \\"I, your Lord, say to you, I shall bring to light your evil intent now, before all people, to destroy my church on earth,\\" Jeffs wrote in the filing.      Just as with the rulings in the previous two motions, the visiting judge denied Jeffs' claims that Walther is biased against the FLDS Church he leads, allowing Walther to continue the trial under the new Texas Supreme Court rules that no longer require an immediate hearing to recuse a judge after evidence in a case has been heard. Walther said a hearing would be held later. The new rules just went into effect Monday.      The delay in the trial on Monday came on the same day that Jeff's brother, Lyle Jeffs, appeared in court as a spectator for the first time, according to the Salt Lake City Tribune. Lyle Jeffs is the bishop of Short Creek, the branch of the FLDS church located in Utah-Colorado City, Ariz.      Silence, Then Outbursts From Jeffs      After choosing to defend himself and then spending hours in silence in court on Thursday, Jeffs released a series of outburst in court on Friday, warning court officials that if they don't stop prosecuting him on two counts of sexual assault of a child, they would face an even bigger problem -- the wrath of God.      After Judge Barbara Walther overruled Jeffs' objection to the proceedings against him, Jeffs, acting as his own lawyer, said he would read what he described as a statement from God. The judge dismissed the jury from the courtroom, and then Jeffs read the statement.      \\"I, the Lord God of heaven,\\" Jeffs read, according to The Associated Press, \\"call upon the court to cease this open prosecution against my pure, holy way.\\"      If officials did not halt the proceedings, the statement said, \\"I will send a scourge upon the counties of prosecutorial zeal to make humbled by sickness and death.\\"      Walther said she'd remove Jeffs from the courtroom if he repeated the claim in front of jurors.      The statement from God capped a day featuring a nearly hour-long outburst by Jeffs, begun with a cry of \\"I object!\\" in court Friday afternoon, followed by a launch into a passionate sermon defending the \\"tradition\\" of polygamy, a practice he considers the will of God.      In opening statements the day before, Thursday, the only time the courtroom heard from the polygamist religious leader during was during a bizarre diatribe in which Jeffs spoke in sermon-like tones for 25 minutes on how his attorneys could not present a \\"pure defense.\\"      After summarily firing his defense team, he sat alone, with his hands folded and head bowed, at the defense table, declining to make an opening statement, issue a plea or question witnesses.      Jeffs' Friday outburst occurred while FBI agent John Broadway was testifying about computers and documents seized from the sect's compound. Broadway was on the verge of describing a list of people living at Jeffs' compound when Jeffs spoke up, saying the trust given to religious leadership should \\"not be touched by government agencies.\\"      During his 55-minute speech, Jeffs, acting as his own lawyer, said polygamy \\"is not [all] of a sudden happening, it is of a tradition in our lives. And how can we just throw it away and say 'God has not spoken?'\\"      \\"We are not a fly-by-night religious society,\\" he said. \\"We are a community of faith and principles and those principles are so sacred. They belong to God, not to man and the governments of man.\\"      The jurors listened carefully, but didn't react to Jeffs' words.      \\"We are derided for how we dress, how we go about our laborers in a common society,\\" Jeffs said, insisting that the Texas authorities who had conducted the April 2008 raid targeted him and his followers because they look different.      He asked state Judge Walther to suspend the case and investigate whether his church's religious freedoms were violated, saying, \\"The government of the United States had no right to infringe on the religious freedom of a peaceful people.\\"      After Jeffs had spoken for nearly an hour, lead prosecutor Eric Nichols said religious freedom does not extend to polygamy.      Jeffs attempted to interrupt, and continued to do so until Walther finally dismissed the jury, ordering Jeffs to speak with defense attorney Deric Walpole, who had been asked to remain present as standby counsel.      Jeffs' sect broke off from the mainstream Mormon Church 72 years ago. His 10,000 followers across North America consider him a prophet who serves as God's spokesman on earth.      Sect teachings emphasize that polygamy is the key to exaltation in heaven, and that young girls and women are to be obedient to their husbands and serve them \\"mind, body and soul\\" to achieve salvation in the afterlife.      On Thursday, the prosecution told jurors they have an audio tape of a sexual encounter between the 55-year-old Jeffs and a 12-year-old girl, and DNA evidence showing he impregnated a 15-year-old girl.      \\"The stakes are very high for Mr. Jeffs,\\" ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams told \\"Good Morning America.\\" \\"In almost all cases here someone decided to represent him or herself, it usually doesn't end well.\\"      The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs, arrives at the the Tom Green County Courthouse for the second day of his sexual assault trial Friday, July 29, 2011, in San Angelo, Texas.

He read Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore, at St. Jago, found Lyell's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes. Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their \\"centre of creation\\". The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed \\"miserable, degraded savages\\", and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.

Also living with them is their butler B.B.C (Tiku Talsania). Because they have no mother, Siddhant has arranged for many governesses or teachers to take care of them, but the children always drive any of these governesses and teachers away. Siddhant soon decides to send his children to boarding school but changes his mind when B.B.C reminds him that when Siddhant threw his younger brother out of the house, he never came back again. Siddhant, however, arranges for another governess. Meanwhile, a con man named Shekhar (Ajay Devgan) and his friend Jadu (Johnny Lever) have just robbed a bank and are on the run from police. Shekhar comes across the beautiful Anna (Kajol) who is to be the governess of the Rai children. Shekhar tries to woo Anna with no success. Shekhar and Jadu follow Anna to the Rai household; Shekhar now believes he has met a rich girl and believes he has hit the jackpot. Although the children initially try and drive Anna away, they come to accept her as an older sister. Shekhar continues to woo Anna and she eventually returns his feelings. With Siddhant's permission, the two get married. On the wedding day, Siddhant learns that Shekhar is a criminal: he stole the wedding rings and only married Anna to gain Siddhant's wealth. Shekhar is sent to prison and Anna decides to leave the house. Siddhant is soon killed in a car accident.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

Write an article that answers the following question: What happened second: protracted action at Verdun or the costly Nivelle Offensive?","output":"Title: The Story of Two Battles: Which Came Second, Verdun or the Nivelle Offensive? Hello, little friends! Today, I'm going to tell you a story about two very important battles from a long, long time ago. These battles were called the Battle of Verdun and the Nivelle Offensive, and they happened during a time called World War One. This was a big war that affected many countries all around the world, and these two battles were fought mostly by two countries: France and Germany. Now, let's talk about which one of these battles happened second. First, we have the Battle of Verdun. This battle started on February 21, 1916, and was a really long and difficult fight between the French and German armies. Verdun was a very important place in France, and the Germans wanted to take control of it. The French fought very bravely to protect this special place, and the battle lasted for a very, very long time. In fact, it lasted for almost 10 months! That's longer than a school year! Finally, on December 18, 1916, the fighting stopped, and the French kept control of Verdun. Next, let's talk about the Nivelle Offensive. This battle has the name of a French commander, General Robert Nivelle. He had a big plan to defeat the German army and win the war for France. The Nivelle Offensive started on April 16, 1917, which is a bit later than the Battle of Verdun. The battle involved both French and British armies, and they fought together against the German army. But things didn't go the way they hoped, and many soldiers were hurt or lost their lives in this fight. After about a month, General Nivelle was replaced by another commander because people were not happy with the way the battle was going. Now, let's answer the big question: Which of these two battles - Verdun or the Nivelle Offensive - happened second? Remember, the Battle of Verdun started in February 1916 and ended in December 1916. The Nivelle Offensive began in April 1917. So, when we compare those dates, we can see that the Nivelle Offensive happened after the Battle of Verdun, which means that the Nivelle Offensive was the second battle. In conclusion, the Battle of Verdun and the Nivelle Offensive were two very important and serious battles that happened during World War One. Both battles were very difficult for the soldiers involved, but through this story, we learned that the Nivelle Offensive happened second, after the long and tough Battle of Verdun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, for the sake of argument, let's explore how cognitive neuroscience might approach tapping into one's brain potential for the sake of improving cognitive abilities. 1. Brain training: Engaging in activities that require mental effort, such as learning new skills or languages, can help keep the brain sharp and improve overall cognitive abilities. 2. Neurofeedback: This technique involves monitoring an individual's brain activity and providing real-time feedback to help them understand and modify their own brain states. Some research has shown that neurofeedback can offer potential benefits in attention, memory, and cognitive flexibility. 3. Meditation and mindfulness: Several studies have demonstrated that regular meditation can help increase the brain's neuroplasticity, enabling one to better adapt to new situations and improve their cognitive skills. Mindfulness can also reduce stress, improve concentration, and promote emotional well-being. 4. Physical exercise: Regular physical activity is known to have a multitude of benefits for cognitive health, including increased blood flow to the brain, reduced inflammation, and increased levels of certain chemicals that promote brain health. 5. Sleep and nutrition: The quality and quantity of sleep an individual receives has a direct impact on their cognitive functioning, while maintaining a healthy diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and essential nutrients can support optimal brain function. Question 2: Is it true that humans only use 10% of their brains? This widely-held belief is actually a myth, and there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that humans only use 10% of their brains. In reality, the entirety of the human brain is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain has a specific function, with numerous regions working together to perform complex tasks and support everyday cognitive functioning. Neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans consistently show activity throughout the brain, demonstrating that humans use far more than just 10% of their brain capacity. Moreover, if humans indeed used only a fraction of their brains, severe brain damage would not cause such devastating consequences, as the \\"unused\\" portions would compensate for any loss of function. In conclusion, the answers to these two questions are not the same. Question 1 addresses the possibility of improving cognitive abilities by tapping into and enhancing the brain's potential, while question 2 addresses the misconception that humans utilize only a small percentage of their brain capacity. However, unraveling the myth behind the \\"10% brain capacity\\" belief subsequently adjusts the context for question 1 as well, encouraging a focus on optimizing brain function rather than unlocking an unused portion of the brain."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

In the 19th and (before the end of World War II) 20th centuries, the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between \\"good antisemitism\\" and \\"bad antisemitism\\". The \\"bad\\" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The \\"good\\" kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who did not make a distinction between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" antisemitism?","output":"It is difficult to pinpoint specific individuals or groups who did not make a distinction between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" antisemitism, as views on antisemitism varied widely among different people, communities, and time periods. However, we can broadly discuss groups and ideologies that did not adhere to the distinction as proposed by the Roman Catholic Church during the 19th and early 20th centuries. 1. The Nazi regime and its collaborators: The most notorious example of antisemitism in the 20th century, the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler, did not differentiate between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" antisemitism. Instead, they viewed Jews as a racially inferior and dangerous group, leading to the systematic persecution and eventual genocide of around six million Jews in the Holocaust. 2. Early Christian communities: Prior to the distinction made by the Roman Catholic Church, several early Christian communities accused Jews of deicide (killing Jesus) and promoted negative stereotypes of Jews. These views, often based on religious grounds, did not differentiate between \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" antisemitism. 3. Radical nationalist and far-right movements: Throughout history, various far-right and nationalist movements have espoused antisemitic views without differentiating between \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" versions. Their understanding of antisemitism often involved conspiracy theories, racial hatred, and discrimination against Jews as a monolithic group. 4. Martin Luther and some Protestant reformers: The Protestant Reformation also features instances of antisemitism, notably from Martin Luther, who authored a virulently antisemitic treatise titled \\"On the Jews and Their Lies.\\" His views were not grounded in the distinction between \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" antisemitism but were rooted in religious differences, accusations of Jewish malice, and the perceived threat they posed to Christianity. It is worth noting that attitudes towards antisemitism changed over time, including within the Roman Catholic Church itself. The Second Vatican Council sought to address and condemn antisemitism through the document \\"Nostra Aetate\\" in 1965, significantly changing the Church's stance on the matter by repudiating the charge of collective Jewish guilt for the crucifixion of Jesus and promoting understanding and respect between Catholics and Jews."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Information:  - The Greenland Sea is a body of water that borders Greenland to the west, the Svalbard archipelago to the east, Fram Strait and the Arctic Ocean to the north, and the Norwegian Sea and Iceland to the south. The Greenland Sea is often defined as part of the Arctic Ocean, sometimes as part of the Atlantic Ocean. However, definitions of the Arctic Ocean and its seas tend to be imprecise or arbitrary. In general usage the term \\"Arctic Ocean\\" would exclude the Greenland Sea. In oceanographic studies the Greenland Sea is considered part of the Nordic Seas, along with the Norwegian Sea. The Nordic Seas are the main connection between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and, as such, could be of great significance in a possible shutdown of thermohaline circulation. In oceanography the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas are often referred to collectively as the \\"Arctic Mediterranean Sea\\", a marginal sea of the Atlantic.  - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state. Norway's coastline is estimated at with fjords, but only when fjords are excluded.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, also known as the Arctic Archipelago, is a group of islands north of the Canadian mainland.  - Liverpool Land is a peninsula in eastern Greenland. Geography. The peninsula is bounded by Scoresby Sund in the south, \\"Carlsberg Fjord\\" in the northwest, \\"Kangerterajiva\\" (Hurry Inlet) in the southwest, the Greenland Sea in the east, and Jameson Land in the west. It was named by William Scoresby, who thought that Hurry Inlet had a confluence with Carlsberg Fjord, separating Liverpool Land from Jameson Land. The fjord-rich peninsula is long from Kap Greville in the north to Uunarteq in the south, up to wide, and measures about in area. It is connected to Jameson Land over a length of .   - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - The Danish Realm is a realm comprising Denmark proper, The Faroe Islands and Greenland.   - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - Global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming. Although the increase of near-surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in the popular press, most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over tens to thousands of years.  - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places.  - Inuit (pronounced or ; Inuktitut: , \\"the people\\") are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska. Inuit is a plural noun; the singular is Inuk. The oral Inuit languages are classified in the Eskimo-Aleut family. Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate spoken in Nunavut.  - Uunartoq Qeqertaq , Greenlandic for \`\` The Warming Island '' , is an island , that was only acknowledged as such in September 2005 , by an American explorer Dennis Schmitt , off the east central coast of Greenland , 550 km ( 340 mi ) north of the Arctic Circle . It was attached to the mainland of Liverpool Land by glacial ice even in 2002 , when the ice shelves began retreating rapidly in this area , so that by 2005 it was no longer attached to the mainland . Members of the scientific community believe this newly discovered island is a direct result of global warming . The island has three large peninsulas , and thus resembles the letter W.  - Jameson Land is a peninsula in eastern Greenland.  Geography. Jameson Land is bounded to the southwest by Scoresby Sound (the world's largest fjord), to the northwest by the Stauning Alps, to the north by Scoresby Land, to the northeast by the Fleming Fjord and the Nathorst Fjord of the Greenland Sea, and to the east by Carlsberg Fjord, the smaller Liverpool Land peninsula branching off, and Hurry Inlet.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.

Summarize this article: Ricciardo beat Rosberg by 0.169 seconds as Hamilton salvaged third after a troubled session in which he suffered an engine problem in final qualifying. The issue meant Hamilton only had one run to everyone else's two and could manage only 0.320secs off the pace. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel took fourth ahead of Force India's Nico Hulkenberg. Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix is live on the BBC Sport website and radio 5 live from 13:00 BST Hamilton had to be wheeled back to the Mercedes garage after his car lost power in the pit lane at the start of the top 10 shoot-out. But he was actually fastest of all in the first sector on his final lap of the session, after doing three build-up laps to try to get the ultra-soft tyres in the best condition. However, his pace dropped off in the final two sectors and he was left to rue yet another technical problem affecting his season. He is 43 points behind Rosberg in the championship, after problems affected his results in three of the first four races - all of which the German won - before the two crashed out together on the first lap in Spain two weeks ago. Hamilton said: \\"I don't really know what to say right now. It was a difficult qualifying but the good thing is I did get out to do a lap, so it is not as bad as some of the races have been. \\"I'm grateful to be up in third and I will do what I can to salvage what I can from today's result.\\" Ricciardo's pole time, the first of the Australian's F1 career, marks an impressive debut for a new, upgraded Renault engine which is worth an extra 30bhp. It is still not quite as powerful as Mercedes' engine but it is close enough for the excellence of the Red Bull chassis in slow corners to make up the difference. Allied to Ricciardo's liquid but exuberant attacking style, it made for a formidable combination around the demanding Monaco street circuit. \\"I knew coming into the weekend we had a strong chance and it looked good from Thursday,\\" Ricciardo said. \\"I feel like I have been driving well the last few races but hadn't got maximum reward. I came into the weekend feeling I could be in this position now. \\"It feels good. I have always enjoyed this place. We have a good package and it is nice to make the most of it.\\" Ricciardo has chosen an alternative strategy for the race - he will start the grand prix on the slower super-soft tyre, using the ultra-soft in the second stint. That means he can run longer before his pit stop and may be able to control the race even more easily than would anyway be the case from pole. Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen crashed heavily early in the first session and will start 21st. The Dutchman, who won the last race in Spain on his debut for Red Bull, misjudged his entry to the second part of the Swimming Pool complex and clouted the barrier on the inside with his right front wheel. That broke his front suspension, and threw him across the track, over the kerbs of the second part of the corner and into the wall. The 18-year-old said: \\"Of course that is not the way you want to start for tomorrow. \\"I turned in a bit too early, broke the suspension and then couldn't recover from it. It's a case of misjudgement - that is all. A miscalculation - I just misjudged the grip a little bit.\\" Further down the field, McLaren's pre-event prediction that they would get both cars into the top 10 fell flat. Fernando Alonso did manage it, qualifying 10th, but team-mate Jenson Button was only 13th. McLaren were surprised by the pace of the Force India and Toro Rosso cars, who they had not expected to be so quick. Behind Hulkenberg, Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari was sixth, but will start 11th because of a five-place penalty for a gearbox change.

Subsisting on unemployment benefits and unable to afford to drive his SUV, Larry buys a scooter from Lamar. At the college, he becomes part of a colorful community of outcasts, also-rans, and the overlooked all trying to find a better future for themselves. Two of the classes he takes are speech, taught by Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts) and economics, taught by Dr. Ed Matsutani (George Takei). While he initially struggles in speech class, he does very well in economics. Mercedes drinks at home after school because she is unhappily married to Dean (Bryan Cranston), a former professor turned writer turned blogger. In reality, Dean spends his days looking at internet porn. Larry's economics classmate Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) invites him to join a club of scooter riders led by her boyfriend Dell Gordo (Wilmer Valderrama). She also updates Larry's home decor, hair style, and wardrobe. Larry's friend Frank (Ian Gomez), who runs the diner, offers him a job to help make ends meet, as Larry had been a Navy cook. After a night with Dean goes horribly wrong, Mercedes is left alone at a bus stop, where Larry and his scooter gang notice her. Larry offers her a ride home, which Mercedes reluctantly accepts. On their way home they witness Dean getting arrested for drunk driving. At her front door, they kiss. She wants to have sex as well, but Larry declines, not wanting to take advantage of her inebriated state. When Dean arrives home the following morning he finds all of his possessions on the front lawn. Realizing there is no way he will not lose his house, Larry uses the knowledge he gained in his Economics class to begin a strategic foreclosure.... My question: Who is Mercedes under the false impression that Larry is involved with? Answer:","output":"Mercedes is under the false impression that Larry is involved with his classmate, Talia. This misunderstanding occurs because of the friendly and close relationship between Larry and Talia as she assists him in updating his home decor, hair, and wardrobe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the man who was the engineer on the album that had the spirit of experimentation? is inside the article: In his book about psychedelic music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley Smile as a work of the \\"ultimate psychedelic rock library\\". Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice..., can you guess it ?

When they do that, NNg charges the salaries of the employees for the applicable # of hours to 42P. Therefore,  42P covers expenses that NNG would have to bear otherwise. Phil feels that the 0.6MM of salaries offsets should be counted toward the 5.0 target since it's a benefit that 42P brings to NNG. James and I talked about this on the phone.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Twenty-year-olds who started antiretroviral therapy in 2010 are projected to live 10 years longer than those first using it in 1996, it found. Doctors say that starting treatment early is crucial to achieve a long and healthy life. Charities say there are still too many people unaware they have the virus. This is particularly true in the developing world, where the majority of HIV deaths occur because access to drugs is limited. The study authors, from the University of Bristol, said the extraordinary success of HIV treatments was a result of newer drugs having fewer side effects and being better at preventing the virus from replicating in the body. It is also more difficult for the virus to build up a resistance to the most recent drugs. Improved screening and prevention programmes and better treatment of health problems caused by HIV are thought to have helped, too. But many people with HIV still do not live as long as expected, especially those infected through injecting drugs. Antiretroviral therapy involves a combination of three or more drugs which block the normal progress of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). They have been called \\"one of the greatest public health success stories of the past 40 years\\". Jimmy Isaacs, 28, discovered he had been infected with HIV by a former partner nearly three years ago. He takes three drugs once a day at 18:00 and will continue to do so for the rest of his life. \\"My health is absolutely fine. I'm eating healthily and drinking healthily,\\" he said. \\"It doesn't impact on my job and hasn't impacted on my social life either.\\" Although it took two changes of medication to find the right combination for him, he says he now has no side effects at all. \\"I had heard a lot of bad stories about the drugs back in the '90s - but when I did some research, I realised the drugs had completely changed.\\" Not all his employers have been supportive since his diagnosis and he says that is down to ignorance. His current employer has given him time off to tour the country and speak to students and school pupils about HIV prevention and treatment. The researchers looked at 88,500 people with HIV from Europe and North America who had been involved in 18 studies. They based their life-expectancy predictions on death rates during the first three years of follow-up after drug treatment was started. They found that fewer people who started treatment between 2008 and 2010 died during this period compared with those who began treatment between 1996 and 2007. The expected age at death of a 20-year-old patient starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) after 2008, with a low viral load and after the first year of treatment, was 78 years - similar to the general population. Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the study showed how much things had changed since the start of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s. But he said it also meant people aged over 50 now represented one in three of all those living with HIV. \\"As it stands, the healthcare, social care and welfare systems simply aren't ready to support the increasing numbers of people growing older with HIV. \\"We need a new model of care to better integrate primary care with HIV specialist services, and we need a major shift in awareness and training around HIV and ageing, so that we're ready to help older people live well in later life,\\" he said. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \\"It's a tremendous medical achievement that an infection that once had such a terrible prognosis is now so manageable, and that patients with HIV are living significantly longer. \\"We hope the results of this study go a long way to finally removing any remaining stigma associated with HIV, and ensuring that patients with HIV can live long and healthy lives without experiencing difficulties in gaining employment and - in countries where it is necessary - obtaining medical insurance.\\" She said steps were being taken to increase appropriate HIV testing by GPs. The proportion of people with undiagnosed HIV has fallen steadily over the past 20 years. But one in eight people with HIV is still thought to remain undiagnosed.

But now, in 2010, they've added more candies to the bag, so if you eat one candy each day, they will last 10 years longer. That's what doctors have discovered with a special medicine for a bad illness called HIV. People who start taking this medicine can live longer than people did before. But, just like some people don’t know they have a candy bag, some people don't know they have this sickness, especially in places where it's hard to get medicines. That's why it's very important for doctors to find these people and give them the medicine.

But it's important to remember, not everyone has found their perfect candy yet. Just like a man named Jimmy, who only felt good after trying two different types of medicine.

Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding  the pesticide  safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure  to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected  of causing cancer.

Using data from the British Department of Environment on pesticides found on fruit collected from supermarkets, scientists have concluded that some children may be consuming a poisonous level of pesticides every day as a result of eating apples or pears. The research, which was published on Sunday, challenges the government's claims that pesticide levels are safe. The current method of measuring pesticide levels involves taking an average reading from a batch of 10 crushed apples.

If \\"A cowboy in a rodeo trying to beat the 8 second clock.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A cowboy is about to be bucked off a bull.\\"?","output":"From the given statement, \\"A cowboy in a rodeo trying to beat the 8-second clock,\\" certain conclusions can be derived, but it is important to examine the context and various elements involved in a rodeo to determine if it logically follows that \\"A cowboy is about to be bucked off a bull.\\" A rodeo is a competitive and entertainment event that often involves various timed activities involving cowboys, bulls, and horses. One of the most iconic events in a rodeo is the bull riding competition. The objective of this sport is for a cowboy to stay mounted on a bull for as long as possible, with the ultimate goal of reaching or exceeding the 8-second mark. Bull riding is dangerous and requires a high level of skill, physical strength, and mental focus for the cowboy. The phrase \\"trying to beat the 8-second clock\\" suggests that the cowboy is attempting to stay on the bull for at least 8 seconds, which is considered the minimum amount of time to earn points and achieve a successful bull ride. If a cowboy is able to remain on the bull for the complete duration of 8 seconds without touching the bull or himself with his free hand, he can potentially score points based on his performance and the bull's bucking action, spin, and agility. A bull in a rodeo is typically restless and attempts to buck off the rider as quickly as possible. Given the unpredictable nature of bulls and the inherent difficulty of bull riding, the likelihood of a cowboy being bucked off is high. However, it is important to note that, at any given moment during the 8-second ride, the cowboy may or may not be on the verge of being bucked off. Success in bull riding depends on factors such as the cowboy's experience, the bull's temperament and bucking patterns, and the rider's ability to maintain the right balance and grip. While it is plausible that a cowboy may be bucked off during the 8-second attempt, the given statement does not explicitly imply that the cowboy is \\"about to be\\" bucked off the bull. This statement could also refer to a skilled cowboy who is doing well in their attempt to stay mounted for the full 8 seconds. In conclusion, the statement \\"A cowboy in a rodeo trying to beat the 8-second clock\\" does not necessarily and logically lead to the conclusion that \\"A cowboy is about to be bucked off a bull.\\" Although the possibility of being bucked off is high in the sport of bull riding, it is important to consider the skill of the cowboy, the bull's behavior, and the specific circumstances during the ride. The statement merely indicates that a cowboy is participating in a bull riding event, attempting to achieve a successful ride to beat the 8-second mark."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They use their sharp teeth to force poison into the insects they catch for food. This poison can make an insect lose the ability to move, and the helpless insect is then _ by the spider. Spiders usually have silk glands under their abdomen. They produce a liquid that is thicker than water from their glands. When the liquid comes into the air, it dries into silk. Many spiders use this silk to form webs to catch insects and to make cocoons that protect their eggs. This amazing silk is also used to create lines that spiders hang onto as they travel to new areas. Spiders live in almost everywhere on earth.

The style is usually marked by horizontal lines, flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves, windows grouped in horizontal bands, integration with the landscape, solid construction, craftsmanship, and discipline in the use of ornament. Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the native prairie landscape. The term \\"Prairie School\\" was not actually used by these architects to describe themselves (for instance, Marion Mahony used the phrase \\"The Chicago Group\\"); the term was coined by H.

A slush fund can be seen as a financial safety net, providing a cushion for individuals or organizations when unforeseen circumstances arise. This financial back-up plan can be highly beneficial in maintaining stability and avoiding potential crises. A slush fund, essentially, is a reserved amount of money set aside for emergencies or unforeseen expenses that are not part of the standard budget. It is often kept separate from savings accounts or other designated funds, allowing individuals or organizations to access it quickly when necessary. It is important to keep in mind that a slush fund should not be used for everyday expenses or frivolous purchases. It is meant to protect against unexpected expenditures, such as medical emergencies, vehicle repairs, sudden job loss, or natural disasters. There are several key reasons why having a slush fund is useful: 1. Financial security: A slush fund acts as a buffer against sudden financial shocks. For example, if someone loses their job and their primary source of income, a slush fund can cover essential expenses while they search for new employment. 2. Reduced stress and anxiety: Knowing that there is a financial cushion available in case of unexpected events can alleviate stress and anxiety associated with money-related issues. 3. Improved mental well-being: Having a slush fund can lead to a sense of financial responsibility and control, boosting confidence and self-reliance. 4. Greater flexibility: With a slush fund in place, individuals and organizations can more effectively address unplanned needs when they arise, such as urgent repairs, without impacting their regular budget or allocated resources. 5. Better financial planning: A slush fund encourages individuals to prepare for the unexpected and be mindful of their financial well-being. This proactive approach can help prevent significant financial disasters in the long run. To build a slush fund, it is essential to first determine the appropriate amount to set aside based on individual or organizational needs. Factors to consider include monthly expenses, existing savings, and unique circumstances such as health conditions or job stability. One common recommendation is to maintain a slush fund sufficient to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses. The fund should be kept in a separate, easily accessible account, such as a high-yield savings account or a money market account. In conclusion, having a slush fund is an essential part of responsible financial planning. It helps individuals and organizations to manage unexpected expenses without jeopardizing their regular budget, providing a safety net that promotes financial stability, reduced stress, and improved mental well-being. By taking the time to establish a slush fund, individuals and organizations can protect themselves from financial crises and navigate unforeseen events with greater ease and confidence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jessica knew how to treat Kayla well, so","output":"when she saw her best friend looking glum, she decided to plan a surprise spa day for the both of them. The first step was to find a day when they were both free, so she asked Kayla about her upcoming schedule without revealing her plan. Once she had a day locked down, Jessica started researching the best local spas and their services. She took into consideration any specific treatments she knew Kayla particularly enjoyed, making sure that the spa she chose offered those options. Jessica did not want to risk anything going wrong, as she knew Kayla really needed a pick-me-up. After selecting a highly-rated spa, Jessica discretely made a reservation for two, requesting private spa rooms and a schedule that included massages, facials, and a manicure-pedicure experience. Jessica felt that these treatments would help Kayla feel relaxed and rejuvenated, while also giving her a confidence boost. Knowing that Kayla would be curious about her plans, Jessica created a loose cover story she could use in case Kayla asked her what they would be doing that day. She decided to tell Kayla that they would be going shopping, which was something they enjoyed doing together. This way, she could ensure that Kayla would dress appropriately for a spa day and would not suspect the true nature of the surprise. Since their spa day was planned for late morning, Jessica thought a light brunch beforehand would be a good idea. She picked up some pastries and fresh fruit from a local bakery the day before, planning to surprise Kayla with a delicious breakfast at her home before they left. The day of the surprise, Jessica woke up early to prepare everything. She set the table with beautiful plates and carefully arranged the pastries and fruit. When everything was ready, she texted Kayla to come over as soon as she could, making it sound like they had a tight schedule for their \\"shopping day.\\" When Kayla arrived, Jessica greeted her with a warm hug and led her to the surprise brunch.

Confused but trusting her best friend, Kayla complied. As they drove to the spa, Kayla's curiosity was piqued, and she tried to guess where they were heading. Jessica expertly dodged her questions, maintaining the element of surprise. Finally, they reached the spa, and Jessica revealed her true plans.

Movie title: Ratatouille Movie plot: Remy is an idealistic and ambitious young rat, gifted with highly developed senses of taste and smell. Inspired by his idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau, Remy dreams of becoming a cook himself. When an old French woman discovers Remy's clan in her house, they are forced to flee, and Remy becomes separated from his family in the panic. He ends up in the sewers of Paris and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant. As Remy watches, a young man named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's devious current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy, but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. Colette Tatou, the staff's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence, and decides to keep him instead.     Remy discovers that he can control Linguini's movements by pulling his hair. On Linguini's first day as a chef, he and Remy find a way to communicate: Remy guides Linguini like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hidden under Linguini's toque, while Skinner assigns Colette to train his new cook.

Answer:","output":"Given the context provided, it can be inferred that Addison would likely feel a variety of emotions and physical sensations after eating tacos at the park and getting full quickly. We must consider multiple factors to explore the possible feelings Addison might experience. Firstly, let's consider the physical sensations that Addison would experience as a result of eating tacos and getting full rapidly. When a person consumes food quickly and becomes full, they might encounter feelings of discomfort or bloating. It is also possible that Addison could feel lethargic after eating a filling meal. This could lead to a decreased inclination towards participating in any physical activities in the park or engaging in social interactions with others. Secondly, let's examine the emotional aspect. Depending on the circumstances surrounding Addison's decision to eat tacos, several emotions might come into play following the meal. If Addison had been craving tacos and was excited at the prospect of eating them, they might initially feel satisfied and content once they have satisfied their craving. However, if the overly full sensation becomes unpleasant, Addison might experience a range of negative emotions, such as regret or disappointment in overeating or eating too quickly. Additionally, if they were eating in the company of friends or family, they might feel self-conscious or embarrassed about suddenly feeling full or uncomfortable. Moreover, it's essential to consider the context and environment in which Addison ate the tacos. The park setting might contribute to their feelings in different ways. If the weather was pleasant and the park's atmosphere was relaxing, Addison might feel more inclined to find a soothing place to sit or lie down and let their fullness subside. On the other hand, if the park was crowded, noisy, or chaotic, they might feel overwhelmed or agitated, especially if they are already experiencing physical discomfort from their meal. Lastly, Addison's personal disposition and temperament would also play a role in how they feel after consuming the tacos. If they are generally an optimistic and resilient person, they might be more capable of managing the physical discomfort and focusing on the positive aspects of their experience, such as the enjoyment of a satisfying meal or the opportunity to spend time outdoors in the park. Conversely, if they are more inclined to dwell on negative feelings or have had a stressful day, the discomfort of getting full quickly could exacerbate their negative emotions and impact their overall mood. In conclusion, while it is difficult to pinpoint precisely how Addison would feel after rapidly becoming full from eating tacos at the park, it is likely that they would experience a mixture of physical sensations and emotions. Factors such as their personal disposition, the circumstances surrounding their meal, and the environment of the park would all play a role in shaping their feelings. Ultimately, one could expect a combination of physical discomfort due to the fullness, emotional contentment from satisfying a craving, and potential regret or disappointment depending on various external factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Francois Hollande leads mourners at funeral service in central Paris.","output":"Title: The Tragic Loss of Christophe de Margerie: Unraveling the Mystery of a Fateful Crash Introduction The shocking and untimely death of Christophe de Margerie, the charismatic former CEO of Total, the world's fourth-largest oil and gas company, has left a profound impact on the international business community. On October 20, 2014, de Margerie's private Falcon 50 jet collided with a snow plough at Moscow's Vnukovo airport, taking the life of one of the most influential figures in the global energy sector. Five years on, French investigators have unveiled new information about the incident, suggesting the snow plough may have played a decisive role in the fatal crash. The funeral service for de Margerie was a somber and heartrending affair, graced by the presence of French President François Hollande. The Enigmatic Crash Christophe de Margerie's death transpired in a puzzling fashion. The Falcon 50 jet, carrying him and a crew of three, was poised for takeoff when a snow plough crossed the runway and mysteriously reversed its course, placing itself directly in the jet's path. The resulting collision caused the plane to burst into flames, claiming the lives of all aboard. In the immediate aftermath, the focus of investigators was primarily aimed at determining whether the snow plough driver, Vladimir Martynenko, was intoxicated at the time. French Investigator's New Findings However, recent findings by French investigators have shifted the focus of the inquiry. Their latest probe reveals that the snow plough inexplicably crossed the runway before reversing into the jet's path. This new twist raises a plethora of questions, including whether the accident was a mere coincidence or if there had been a catastrophic failure in airport coordination and communication. The crash has triggered a broader discussion on the inherent challenges and risks associated with operating complex machinery in extreme weather conditions. In the case of de Margerie's fatal incident, the visibility at Moscow's Vnukovo airport was down to a mere 350 meters due to thick fog and snowfall. The revelation by French investigators adds to the growing demands for enhanced safety measures and better coordination protocols at airports worldwide. François Hollande at the Funeral Service Following the tragic event, former French President François Hollande led the mourners at the funeral service held in central Paris. The ceremony was attended by numerous dignitaries, politicians, and business leaders who gathered to pay their respects to Christophe de Margerie. Hollande's presence at the service was emblematic of de Margerie's standing in French society, where he was considered a national icon in the business world. Christophe de Margerie's Enduring Legacy Though the final moments of his life were shrouded in mystery and controversy, Christophe de Margerie's professional legacy continues to thrive. He was a leader who was remembered for his vibrant personality, strategic acumen, and unparalleled dedication to his company's success. In his 37-year tenure at Total S.A., de Margerie helped transform the company into a leading global energy player with operations in over 130 countries. His passing left an indelible mark, with people worldwide mourning the loss of a visionary leader and an iconic figure in the energy sector. Conclusion The renewed investigation into Christophe de Margerie's fatal crash has brought the tragic incident into the spotlight once more. While his untimely death remains a mystery, one thing is clear: Christophe de Margerie's legacy will continue to inspire, motivate, and shape the energy industry for years to come. The funeral service was a moving testament to the esteem and love he inspired in countless individuals, and François Hollande's presence was a reflection of his enduring impact on the French business community. As the inquiry continues and new findings shed light on the circumstances leading up to the accident, we can only hope to unravel the enigma behind this fateful crash and pursue greater safety measures to prevent similar incidents in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While Obama touted the progress the OPTIONS: - Barack Obama has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - Ebola has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - New York has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - Obama has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - U.S. has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - United Nations has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done.","output":"While Obama touted the progress the U.S. has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. He emphasized the importance of international cooperation and collaboration in addressing this global health crisis, underscoring that no single country can tackle the problem alone. The United States had taken significant steps to combat the Ebola outbreak, including deploying military personnel to West Africa to help with logistics, constructing treatment centers, and providing financial support and resources to the affected countries. President Obama urged other nations to increase their efforts and contributions in the fight against Ebola, highlighting the dire consequences of inaction. He noted that Ebola had the potential to devastate not only the healthcare systems of affected countries but also their economies, education systems, and overall stability. In an effort to galvanize the international community, Obama called on leaders and organizations worldwide to step up their commitment to this pressing issue by providing additional healthcare workers, supplies, and financial support to the region. He also underscored the need for better coordination and communication among various nations and agencies working on the ground to ensure that resources are effectively deployed where they are most needed. While the global response to the Ebola outbreak had been sluggish initially, President Obama's call to action helped catalyze an increased commitment from a range of countries and international organizations. In the following weeks and months, countries such as the United Kingdom, China, France, and Germany ramped up their contributions to the response efforts, providing critical resources and expertise. Moreover, global health agencies such as the World Health Organization and non-governmental organizations like Doctors Without Borders bolstered their presence on the ground. These collaborative international efforts ultimately played a crucial role in containing the Ebola outbreak and helped save countless lives. While the crisis exposed the vulnerabilities of the global health infrastructure and the need for improved preparedness for future pandemics, it also demonstrated the power and potential of concerted, global action in the face of a common threat. In conclusion, President Barack Obama's remarks at the United Nations meeting on Ebola served as a wake-up call for the international community, urging countries and organizations to step up their response to the epidemic. His warning that the world had not done enough to tackle the issue pushed countries to collaborate and contribute more, which ultimately played a significant role in successfully containing the outbreak and minimizing its devastating toll."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Spartans inspect each infant born to ensure it is whole - if it is deformed, the baby is abandoned to die. They raise their boys in the school of hard knocks, the agoge - in combat training, a small boy's loss of his weapon earns a bloody lip from the hand of his own father. At age 7, each young boy is torn from his mother and makes his own way in the wilderness, to return a man. Even the King endures this rite of passage.

Acknowledging the threat of Xerxes's invasion force, he visits the Ephors (priests) to obtain their favour before sending the Spartan army in battle.

Article: Does beer make you shlur your wordsh? You're not alone: drunk zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) sing songs that are blurrier and more disordered than those of their sober counterparts.      What's more, binge drinking may permanently impair juvenile finches' ability to learn new songs – which could have implications for our understanding of the effect of heavy drinking on adolescents.      Having a unique and interesting song is important for zebra finches to mate, and each male develops his own signature tune as he matures, says Christopher Olson of Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.      Because zebra finch song is so well studied, Olson and colleagues decided to find out how alcohol would affect it. First, they had to find out whether finches are even interested in alcohol.      When they gave a group of adult finches 6 per cent ethanol in their water bottles, the birds drank enough of it that their blood alcohol content sometimes reached 0.8 per cent: the legal limit for drivers in many places.      Husky bar voice      The birds were also happy to sing while drunk. Using audio analysis software, the researchers determined the degree of \\"white noise\\", or disorganised sounds, in their songs. The drunk birds' songs were significantly more broken and disorganised. \\"It's their husky bar voice,\\" says Olson.      Next, the researchers tested how alcohol affects song learning by putting 3 per cent ethanol in the water bottles of birds who were only 40 days old and had just been weaned. They left the spiked water there for 90 days and measured the birds' songs periodically.      Almost immediately, significant differences appeared between these birds and controls. Normally, Olson says, young birds \\"babble\\" and experiment with disordered noises before settling on their own song, which is inspired by their fathers and cagemates .      But the drinking finches experimented less, and settled on a simple song at day 55.      It's surprising how early the researchers could see the effects in the adolescent birds, says Ofer Tchernichovski at the City University of New York. He says it is the first study of the effects of a drug on such a well-understood learned behaviour, and adds that he is curious to know what happens when the alcohol is withdrawn.      The researchers hypothesise that alcohol might be suppressing the young birds' creativity by hurting the plasticity, or flexibility of their brains to learn. In general, finches are no longer able to learn new songs as adults, Olson says, so the effects could be long-term. They are now following these birds for longer to determine whether adult birds become dependent on alcohol, and whether the young birds' songs develop any further if alcohol is withdrawn.      Olson presented the results at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, this week. He says the work may also tell us something about how learning behaviour in the adolescent human brain is affected by binge drinking.

Christopher Olson and his colleagues at Oregon Health and Science University recently set out to find if the same was true for birds, specifically zebra finches.      \\"We just showed up in the morning and mixed a little bit of juice with 6 percent alcohol, and put it in their water bottles and put it in the cages,\\" Olson told All Things Considered's Arun Rath. \\"At first we were thinking that they wouldn't drink on their own because, you know, a lot of animals just won't touch the stuff. But they seem to tolerate it pretty well and be somewhat willing to consume it.\\"      The finches long have been used as a model to study human vocal learning, or how people learn to communicate using language, Olson said. Obviously, alcohol affects human speech, so Olson and his team checked for similar problems with the birds.      The blood alcohol levels achieved — .05 to .08 percent — would be laughed off by many college students, but because birds metabolize alcohol differently it was plenty to produce the effects the scientists were looking for.      Listen to the audio, and you'll hear that the finches' song gets a bit quieter and just a little slurred, or as Olson puts it, \\"a bit less organized in their sound production\\" — like a roommate calling from a bar to get a ride home.      In the future, Olson wants to find out whether alcohol affects not just how birds sing but how they learn new songs — like a roommate partying so late he's still drunk in class the next morning. |||||Summary:","output":"Scientists found that when zebra finches drink alcohol, their songs become more disorganized and harder to understand. They wanted to see if alcohol would have the same effect on birds as on humans. They gave the birds alcohol mixed with juice, and the birds drank it. Then they analyzed the noises that the birds made. Just like when people drink too much and their speech gets slurred, the birds' songs became messy and hard to understand.

Here is a news article: While North Korea’s missile test on August 28, reportedly of the intermediate range Hwasong-12 (KN-17), broke up into three pieces during flight only flying 2,700 kilometers—far short of its 4,000 kilometer range—the launch was a disturbing development in Pyongyang’s continuing program to develop long-range missiles.      Why Fly Over Japan?      The test launch had two primary objectives. First, Kim Jong Un likely sought to take measure of the international community’s response to the overflight of Japanese territory. Though North Korea twice before attempted to launch a satellite using a flight path that passed over Japan, the Hwasong-12 is the first ballistic missile to overfly the island nation. If the US response to the test firing is judged to be mild by Pyongyang, North Korea may feel that future flights will be similarly accepted by Washington and its regional allies.      Second, the flight was likely intended to evaluate the missile’s performance and reliability under operational conditions. Before the Hwasong-12 and the intercontinental range Hwasong-14 can be deployed, engineers must demonstrate that they work reliably when flown to maximum range. To date, the two missiles have been launched on steep flight paths that reach high altitudes, ensuring that the mock warheads land in the sea just short of Japan. Much can be learned from the tests, but full-range flights replicating the conditions a combat-capable missile would experience are needed. This flight begins to address that requirement.      Is North Korea Testing a Post-Boost Vehicle (PBV)?      The most recent Hwasong-12 flight ended with the mock warhead landing in the Pacific Ocean about 2,700 km from the launch site, well short of its maximum range. North Korean engineers may have shut the Hwasong-12’s engine down early, resulting in a shorter flight. Turning off the engine roughly five seconds early would yield a range and apogee matching the reported values. Or the payload mass of the first test may have been considerably lighter than that of North Korea’s nuclear warhead, allowing the missile to achieve a much higher altitude, thus exaggerating the derived maximum range when the missile is flown on a standard flight path. For example, if the May flight carried a payload of 250 kg, and the most recent test fitted the Hwasong-12 with a 1,250-kg package, the range is reduced to about 2,700 km, with a peak altitude of roughly 550 km. Finally, the Hwasong-12 may have been flown on a non-optimal trajectory, one that was steeper or flatter than a normal flight path employed to maximize achievable range. However, the reported apogee of the Hwasong-12 flight is inconsistent with this explanation.      An alternative disturbing hypothesis is that tests of the missile have included a small post-boost vehicle (PBV) to provide extra boost to the payload after the main stage is discarded. The May 14 test of the Hwasong-12 was previously modeled, but could not replicate the flight’s reported apogee and range, without the addition of a small PBV. The increased velocity provided by the PBV allows the payload to reach an apogee of 2,000 km and travel about 700 km in range. The hypothesis is consistent with observations made by others, including Norbert Brugge, who identified the existence of fuelling ports located just under the Hwasong-12’s reentry vehicle.      There are logical reasons for employing a PBV. In addition to boosting range, it can be used to make fine adjustments to payload’s velocity after engine shut-down. ICBMs fielded by the US, Russia, France and China all employ PBVs to achieve better accuracy. PBVs also provide a platform to carry a warhead, plus lightweight decoys or other penetration aids capable of impairing effectiveness against missile defenses.      The presence of a PBV on the Hwasong-12 is just a hypothesis for now, although reports that the missile “broke into three pieces” are consistent with PBV engine failure. As the PBV separates from the main booster, its engine should activate and accelerate the reentry vehicle to the pre-defined velocity. If the PBV’s engine fails to initiate, and the reentry vehicle separates from the PBV, all three components (main booster, PBV and warhead) follow an approximately similar trajectory. To a distant radar, the missile appears to separate into three disparate pieces at the end of boost for no obvious reason. Without the added velocity provided by a properly functioning PBV, the reentry vehicle along with the main stage and PBV, land in the ocean 2,700 km from the launch site—well short of the missile’s maximum range. In other words, the dead weight of the non-functioning PBV, if it was fully fuelled, is equivalent to launching the missile with a 1,200 to 1,300 kg payload, as described above.      While it is impossible to know with certainty why the most recent test flew only 2,700 km, if it was the result of a failed PBV, its use on North Korea’s long-range missiles is ominous. It is another sign that Pyongyang is deadly serious about developing and fielding nuclear-tipped missiles capable of striking the US mainland, and critical US military bases in the Pacific Ocean. North Korea has much work remaining—perhaps a year or two—before it matures the technologies and systems needed to credibly threaten the US. ||||| The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer! ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Courtney Kube and F. Brinley Bruton      WASHINGTON — U.S. forces shot down a medium-range ballistic missile off the coast of Hawaii Wednesday as part of a test conducted amid heightened regional tensions.      Early Wednesday local time, U.S. Navy sailors on the USS John Paul Jones \\"successfully conducted a complex defense flight test,\\" according to a statement by the Missile Defense Agency, a section of the Defense Department.      \\"We are working closely with the fleet to develop this important new capability, and this was a key milestone,\\" the agency's director Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves said in a statement. \\"We will continue developing ballistic missile defense technologies to stay ahead of the threat as it evolves.\\"      This is not the first time the U.S. forces have conducted this sort of test.      Related: Why It's So Hard for U.S. Spies to Figure Out North Korea      Wednesday's move by the U.S. came after a series of North Korean missile tests and threats by Kim Jong Un. On Monday, Pyongyang fired a ballistic missile over Japan. This prompted President Donald Trump to say the U.S. is \\"100 percent with Japan.\\"      On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that, \\"The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!\\"      Later Wednesday morning, Secretary of Defense James Mattis said, \\"We're never out of diplomatic solutions.\\"      Mattis, appearing alongside his South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Song Young Moo, added, \\"We continue to work together and the minister and I share responsibility to provide for the protection of our nation our populations and our interests, which is what we are here to discuss.\\"      In a statement released by the White House on Tuesday, Trump reiterated that \\"all options are on the table\\" when it comes to North Korea.      He added: \\"Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime’s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world.\\"      The U.S. and South Korea are currently conducting war games, and North Korea typically reacts with anger to such military drills.      North Korea aims to build an arsenal of nuclear missiles that can reliably target the United States. In addition, leader Kim has conducted several long-range ballistic missile tests this year, including firing two intercontinental ballistic missiles.      Courtney Kube reported from Washington, F. Brinley Bruton reported from London ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"North Korea reportedly had two objectives with its recent missile test, which flew over Japan. The first was to gauge the international response to such an aggressive action, while the second was to evaluate the missile's performance under operational conditions. Although the missile only flew 2,700 kilometers out of its potential 4,000, experts have put forth hypotheses explaining the shortened flight. One such hypothesis is that a post-boost vehicle (PBV), designed to provide extra payload boost, failed during the test flight, consistent with reports of the missile breaking into three pieces. The use of a PBV would indicate that North Korea is serious about developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the US mainland and could be one to two years away from doing so."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis. It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengths or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. Premise: PersonX takes PersonY's girlfriend out to dinner Hypothesis: Before, PersonX needed to have a car Update: PersonX made sure to download Uber app. Output:","output":"The task is asking you to assess whether the update statement strengthens or weakens the hypothesis based on the premise provided. Here are the steps to do so: 1. Read the premise sentence, which in this case is \\"PersonX takes PersonY's girlfriend out to dinner\\". This is the base situation provided to you. 2. Read the hypothesis, which is \\"Before, PersonX needed to have a car\\". This statement suggests an assumption about the situation described in the premise, but its validity hasn't yet been confirmed. 3. Read the update, \\"PersonX made sure to download Uber app\\". This might change our perspective on the hypothesis.  4. Now to determine whether the update weakens or strengthens the hypothesis, evaluate if the update makes it more likely (strengthens), or less likely (weakens) that the hypothesis is true. In this case, since PersonX downloading the Uber app suggests he can travel without needing his own car, it weakens the hypothesis that \\"Before, PersonX needed to have a car\\". 5. Hence, the output should be 'weakener' as the update weakens the likelihood of the hypothesis being true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Several types of gases form in the atmosphere - May come from different sources - The gases remain trapped in the atmosphere - Through the suns light the gases hold in heat and energy - Trap them in our atmosphere - The earth may become warmer this way.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fewer gases will be trapped happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis presented here suggests that fewer gases would be trapped within the atmosphere, leading to potentially altered effects on the greenhouse effect. To properly address this hypothesis, we must first understand the greenhouse effect and the role of greenhouse gases in this process. The greenhouse effect is a natural process through which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, absorb and trap thermal energy emitted from the Earth's surface. This trapped energy helps keep the planet warm enough to sustain life. The primary greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, among others. These gases can come from various sources such as deforestation, burning fossil fuels, and agricultural activities. Now that we have established the importance of greenhouse gases in maintaining the Earth's temperature, let's analyze the perturbation hypothesis - that is, assuming fewer gases will be trapped in the atmosphere, and how this might affect the greenhouse effect. If fewer greenhouse gases were to be trapped in the atmosphere, two possible scenarios could arise: 1. Decreased greenhouse effect: A decrease in the number of greenhouse gases may result in a decrease in the greenhouse effect. In this case, less heat would be trapped in the Earth's atmosphere, which could potentially lead to a decline in global temperatures. This situation could have various consequences on the environment, such as affecting the growth of plants, availability of water resources, changes in weather patterns, and overall impact on the ecosystems. 2. Increased greenhouse effect due to indirect consequences: Though the initial hypothesis suggests less trapping of gases, a decrease in some greenhouse gases in the atmosphere might have indirect effects resulting in an increase in other greenhouse gases. For example, lower global temperatures might lead to increased amounts of ice and snow, which reflect sunlight back into space. With less solar radiation being absorbed by the Earth, lower temperatures could indirectly cause higher concentrations of water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere. This increase in water vapor might lead to even more heat being trapped in the atmosphere, amplifying the greenhouse effect. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis supposes that fewer greenhouse gases would be trapped in the atmosphere, but its actual effect on the greenhouse effect remains uncertain. This perturbation could either directly result in a decreased greenhouse effect or indirectly contribute to a greater greenhouse effect through a series of feedback mechanisms. Both scenarios highlight the complexity of Earth's atmosphere and the intricate relationships between various factors that contribute to climate change. Further research and scientific modeling are necessary to better understand the implications of such perturbations and their potential consequences on the Earth's climate system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Liverpool players had a double celebration on Sunday night as they threw a surprise party for Glen Johnson's birthday after victory in their  Premier League opener against Southampton. Dressed in masks of the full back's face made specially for the occasion, Johnson was greeted by his team-mates Joe Allen, Brad Jones, Lucas Leiva, Philippe Coutinho, Sebastian Coates and Fabio Borini to try and frighten him for his 30th. And, considering his milestone birthday isn't until this coming Saturday, the chances are he won't have seen his colleagues' tribute coming.

Se on luotu erilaisten innovaatioyhteisöjen kautta, jotka yhdistävät yliopistot, tutkimusorganisaatiot ja yritykset yhteistyöhön yhteisten tavoitteiden saavuttamiseksi. EIT:n tavoitteena on lisätä Euroopan kilpailukykyä sekä kehittää tieteellisiä ideoita ja löytöjöjä kaupallisiksi sovelluksiksi. Silti osa ihmisistä ja organisaatioista on ilmaissut epäilyksiä ja skeptisyyttä EIT:n toiminnan lisäarvosta. Tämä johtuu monista syistä, kuten EIT:n mielestä olemassa olevista vastaavista organisaatioista ja ohjelmista sekä huolista siitä, että EIT saattaa toimia rajoittavana tekijänä sen sijaan, että se kannustaisi eurooppalaista innovaation ekosysteemiä. Tämän vuoksi on tärkeää analysoida EIT:n toiminta ja tehdä vertailuanalyyseja arvioidaksemme sen tarjoamaa lisäarvoa. Yksi tekijä, joka voi auttaa ymmärtämään EIT:n tarjoamaa lisäarvoa, on sen kyky tuoda eri alojen osaajat ja toimijat yhteen. Toisin kuin monissa muissa organisaatioissa ja ohjelmissa, EIT auttaa yhteistyön luomisessa erilaisten osapuolten välillä, kuten poliittisten päättäjien, akateemisten asiantuntijoiden ja yrityssektorin edustajien kesken. EIT:n merkittävä etu on sen monialainen lähestymistapa innovaation suhteen. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että EIT:n innovaatioalueisiin kuuluvat terveys, energia, ilmasto, digitaaliteknologia ja raaka-aineet. Tällainen laaja näkemys ja yhteistyö eri alojen kesken saattaa johtaa aidosti mullistaviin innovaatioihin ja ratkaisuihin, jotka voivat osaltaan auttaa Eurooppaa vastaamaan yhteiskunnallisiin ja taloudellisiin haasteisiin. Lisäksi EIT:n kautta on luotu panostus koulutukseen, jota ei ehkä ole saatavilla samassa laajuudessa muissa organisaatioissa ja ohjelmissa. EIT tarjoaa koulutusohjelmia, jotka yhdistävät tekniset taidot yrittäjyysosaamiseen, auttaen osallistujia ymmärtämään innovaatioketjun eri vaiheita ja kehittämään ratkaisuja, jotka ovat sekä käytännöllisiä että kaupallisesti kannattavia. Kuitenkin on myös syytä tunnistaa ja toimia EIT:n heikkouksien ja skeptisyyden syiden parantamiseksi. Esimerkiksi resurssien tehokasta käyttöä voidaan parantaa, ja EIT:n tavoitteiden ja toiminnan tulisi olla avoimempia ja läpinäkyvämpiä. Näin varmistetaan, että EIT:n toiminta tuottaa konkreettisia tuloksia ja todistettavaa lisäarvoa Euroopalle. Yhteenvetona EIT:n skeptisyyden keskellä on tärkeää tunnistaa sen mahdollinen lisäarvo ja mitä se voi tarjota, samalla kun kohdistetaan huomio sen heikkouksiin ja mahdollisiin parannuksiin. EIT:n rooli eurooppalaisessa innovaatioekosysteemissä voi olla merkittävä, jos se pystyy edistämään tehokasta yhteistyötä ja tuottamaan innovaatioita, jotka vastaavat Euroopan yhteiskunnallisiin ja taloudellisiin tarpeisiin."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: From the moment I stepped into Epicurean Delights, I knew I was in for a truly special dining experience. The warm and welcoming atmosphere, coupled with the attentive and genuinely sincere staff, made me feel right at home. Throughout the evening, I was constantly impressed by every single aspect of this fine establishment. Firstly, let me rave about the exceptional menu selection. Epicurean Delights offers an extensive array of dishes that cater to various dietary preferences and tastes, including gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian options. Their innovative culinary creations combine classic and contemporary techniques, showcasing an impressive level of expertise and creativity. The food itself was nothing short of outstanding. I decided to start with their signature appetizer, the truffle-infused mushroom tart. The perfectly flaky crust, combined with the rich, earthy flavors of the mushrooms and truffle, truly blew me away. The presentation was also an exquisite treat for the eyes, garnished with edible flowers and a delicate drizzle of truffle oil. For my main course, I opted for the pan-seared sea bass with a delightful citrus beurre blanc sauce, served on a bed of seasonal vegetables and roasted fingerling potatoes. The fish was cooked to perfection, featuring a crispy skin and tender, flaky meat that melted in my mouth. The accompanying sauce brought a vibrant freshness to the dish, beautifully complimenting the well-seasoned vegetables and succulent potatoes. Dessert was another outstanding experience. I indulged in the decadent chocolate soufflé served with a side of raspberry coulis and freshly whipped cream. The soufflé itself had a warm, molten center that oozed out gracefully as I dove in, creating the perfect balance of rich chocolate and tangy raspberry. I would be remiss not to mention the superb wine list available at Epicurean Delights. With an extensive variety of options ranging from local to international wines, the sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in suggesting the perfect pairing for my meal. The wine truly enhanced the flavors present in each dish, elevating the overall dining experience. The impeccable service only added to the wonderful ambiance at Epicurean Delights. Each member of the waitstaff was attentive, friendly, and professional, making me feel truly pampered throughout my meal. They were able to provide recommendations and answer any questions I had about the menu, further showcasing their dedication and passion for providing a top-notch experience for their guests. In conclusion, Epicurean Delights provides an unparalleled dining experience that I will not soon forget. From the mouth-watering dishes and outstanding service to the warm ambiance and beautiful presentation, every aspect of my evening was truly exceptional. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to indulge in a truly remarkable culinary adventure.

Driven by the urgency of creating jobs & protecting #hcr #wsr , Social Security & Medicare, I am running for Dem Leader. ||||| Nancy Pelosi has announced that she will run for House Democratic Leader. \\"Driven by the urgency of creating jobs & protecting #hcr, #wsr, Social Security & Medicare, I am running for Dem Leader,\\" she tweeted on Friday.      On Thursday, Blue Dog Democrat Heath Shuler said he would challenge Pelosi for the post if she ran. Several other Democrats have said they would prefer a leader other than Pelosi, but in an interview with Ryan Grim, Pelosi told The Huffington Post on Thursday that she was canvassing for votes.      In a Wednesday interview with ABC, Pelosi told Diane Sawyer that she has \\"no regrets\\" about her time as Speaker of the House, and evaluated her performance as a \\"job well done.\\"      Ohio Republican John Boehner, the Speaker-in-waiting, said on Thursday that \\"there seems to be some denial on the part of the president and other Democratic leaders of the message that was sent by the American people,\\" a statement which presumably referred in part to Pelosi.      More from the AP:      WASHINGTON — Despite widespread complaints about massive losses that will put Democrats in the minority, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday she will try to stay on as leader of her party in the House.      The decision exposed a rift between Pelosi's liberal allies and the dwindling number of moderate Democrats, who feel besieged and eager for substantive and symbolic changes in direction after Tuesday's Republican rout. It also is likely to trigger leadership battles farther down the ladder.      Pelosi, the nation's first female speaker, said many colleagues urged her to seek the post of minority leader in the new Congress that convenes in January. That will be the Democrats' top post, because Republicans, who grabbed more than 60 Democratic-held seats Tuesday, will elect the next speaker. It will be John Boehner of Ohio, who will swap titles with Pelosi if she succeeds in her bid.      \\"We have no intention of allowing our great achievements to be rolled back,\\" Pelosi, 70, said in a letter to her colleagues.      Allies said Pelosi would not make the bid unless she felt she had the votes. Some cautioned, however, that House members vote by secret ballot when electing the leaders of their respective parties at the start of each new Congress. Pelosi's caucus is more heavily liberal now that many moderate Democrats lost on Tuesday, but even some Pelosi admirers are distressed by the magnitude of the losses.      Several moderates, and even some longtime Pelosi supporters, had openly criticized her in their re-election campaigns, and had urged her to step aside. Pelosi's Friday announcement caught some off guard.      Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., had told a Louisville TV station on Thursday, \\"as good a leader as she has been, I don't think she's the right leader to take us forward.\\"      He reversed field Friday after she announced her intentions, and after a senior Pelosi ally, Rep. George Miller of California, called him.      Pelosi \\"has proven time and time again that she is able to build consensus in a caucus comprised of members from all across the ideological spectrum,\\" Yarmuth said.      Other House Democrats held their ground.      Rep. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., said he was \\"disappointed that Speaker Pelosi is going to seek the position of Minority Leader.\\" North Carolina Rep. Larry Kissell's office said he hopes Pelosi \\"will change her mind and step aside.\\"      Reps. Dan Boren of Oklahoma and Mike Ross of Arkansas also said they opposed Pelosi.      They were among the many House Democrats whom Republicans criticized for their loyalty to the California liberal, who was a forceful though generally well-liked speaker. During her four years as Speaker, Pelosi used all her political muscle to enact contentious measures such as President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.      Republicans were giddy in learning the news.      Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, in a meeting with reporters, put his hands over his head and applauded. \\"My breath is taken away by that announcement,\\" he said, grinning.      In a statement, White House spokesman Bill Burton said the president appreciates the work of Pelosi and the Democratic leadership team \\"who have been great partners in moving the country forward\\" and he looks forward to working with them.      Pelosi's announcement set off a likely battle for the No. 2 Democratic leadership job, now held by Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. The party's third-ranking leader, House Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, said he will try to keep the job, which will become the second in command when Democrats become the minority.      If Clyburn – the House's highest-ranking African-American – prevails, Hoyer would be forced out of the leadership ranks for the first time in many years.      Hoyer said he would make a decision after consulting with lawmakers, adding, \\"I have received an outpouring of support from Democratic colleagues who have told me that I should remain in our party's leadership.\\"      Hoyer is more centrist than Pelosi, and the two have long had a cordial but somewhat wary relationship.      Pelosi's bid presumably will keep her atop the Democratic caucus, which will number about 190 members next year. But it would mark a big drop from being speaker, which carries tremendous power to influence legislation and is second only to the vice president in the line of presidential succession.      Among those defending her was Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill. \\"We're in a political storm,\\" he said, \\"but we don't need to adopt an 'any leader in a storm' mentality.\\"      Several Democratic lawmakers in conservative districts had vowed to oppose Pelosi as speaker, but some of them lost their re-election bids all the same.      One survivor, Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina, had said he might challenge Pelosi because the party needs a more moderate leader. Shuler noted that he lost his job as Washington Redskins quarterback in 1997 after the team performed poorly.      As the magnitude of Tuesday's election losses sunk in, even some longtime supporters of Pelosi said she needed to step aside as the party leader.      \\"I voted for everything she asked me to vote for,\\" said Rep. Albio Sires, D-N.J. \\"You know, sometimes in this business it's difficult to know when to move on.\\"      \\"With all the losses that we had with governors and all the redistricting that's going to be done, we don't need the target,\\" Sires said, referring to the once-a-decade House redistricting process about to begin nationwide.      If Pelosi remains as the Democrats' House leader, it's possible the party will absorb historic election losses without making significant leadership changes. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., will keep his post.      Pelosi's decision also may enable Republicans to keep demonizing her as an emblem of Democratic liberalism, as they did in so many campaigns this fall.      ___      Associated Press writers Philip Elliott, Andrew Taylor, David Espo, Ben Evans, Henry C. Jackson, Julie Pace and Stephen Ohlemacher contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Nancy Pelosi has announced her intention to run for House Democratic Leader, despite facing criticism from some moderate Democrats who would prefer a different leader.

Article:","output":"Title: Big Cat Trains Hunting Skills at Mukuni Big 5 Safari, Prepping for Release Into the Wild An incredible display of nature and technology recently took place at Mukuni Big 5 Safari in Livingstone, Zambia, where a big cat was seen chasing a fake chicken along a zip-wire. This encounter was far from accidental – it is an innovative part of a breeding and rehabilitation programme focused on preparing the predator for eventual release into the wild. The Mukuni Big 5 Safari is a renowned wildlife reserve and conservation facility located in Zambia, where they work tirelessly to ensure the survival and preservation of endangered species. The zip-wire technology allows the big cats, including lions, leopards, and cheetahs, to fine-tune their natural hunting instincts in a controlled and safe environment. The use of a fake chicken as bait may seem unorthodox, but it provides the perfect opportunity for the big cat to practice its hunting skills without endangering any real prey. The intriguing chase is all part of the predator's training regime, aimed at mentally and physically preparing them for life in the wild. Once the predator has successfully chased and \\"captured\\" that fake chicken on multiple occasions, the staff at Mukuni Big 5 Safari deem it sufficiently prepared to face the challenges of the wild. This outcome can be credited to the dedication and efforts of the staff, who work diligently to provide education, guidance, and hands-on training tailored to each animal's specific needs. The programme at Mukuni Big 5 Safari intends to combat the rapidly decreasing numbers of big cats found in the wild due to habitat loss, poaching, and other man-made threats. By reintroducing these animals into their natural habitats, it not only gives them a chance to thrive but also contributes to the continued existence and genetic diversity of their species. The successful implementation of this method has garnered attention and recognition from wildlife conservationists and researchers worldwide. Such pioneering techniques have the potential to be integrated into other breeding and rehabilitation programmes, allowing conservation facilities to save and restore more animal populations that face similar threats. As part of their innovative programme, Mukuni Big 5 Safari is an active contributor to local and international conservation and research initiatives. Their preservation efforts not only focus on raising awareness but also on inspiring the support of local communities, businesses, and tourists. By doing so, they involve all relevant stakeholders in their mission to prevent species extinction and secure a brighter future for some of Earth's most majestic creatures. In summary, the remarkable scene of a big cat chasing a fake chicken along a zip-wire at Mukuni Big 5 Safari underpins a critical initiative that harbors the power to change the fate of these magnificent animals. Combining ingenuity, technology, and a thorough understanding of animal behavior, the staff at Mukuni perseveres in their mission to restore the delicate balance of nature and ensure that big cats can survive and flourish in the wild for generations to come."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: An earthquake strikes Mexico, resulting in the overnight birth of a new volcano. Sent to study this phenomenon are geologists Dr. Hank Scott and Dr. Arturo Ramos. En route to the village of San Lorenzo, the two men witness a destroyed house and police car. They find a dead policeman nearby, as well as an abandoned infant. They take the infant to San Lorenzo and give it to friends of the child's now missing parents; they are welcomed by the village's priest, Father Delgado. In addition to the disappearances of locals and the destruction of their homes, there have been wholesale slaughters of livestock and strange roaring noises in the night. The villagers believe the culprit to be a demon bull and have been pestering Delgado for divine assistance. Undaunted, Hank and Arturo begin their geological survey as members of the Mexican army, led by Major Cosio, arrive in San Lorenzo to begin disaster relief efforts. Hank meets and falls in love with local rancher Teresa Alvarez and makes friends with a young boy named Juanito. The volcano erupts again and the true culprits behind the disappearances and deaths are revealed as giant prehistoric scorpions. After killing a staff of telephone repairmen, the scorpions turn their attention to San Lorenzo itself, with the guns of Major Cosio's troops having no effect on them. The next morning, the scorpions have returned to their underground lair (which, in addition to the scorpions, is home to giant worms and spiders), leaving the authorities to seek the help of renowned entomologist Dr. Velasco. It is up to him, Hank, and Arturo to figure out a way to either destroy the scorpions or seal off the entrance to their cavern home, before more innocent lives are lost. Despite collapsing the cave entrance, the giant scorpions make it to the surface and destroy a train, killing some passengers before fighting amongst themselves. In the end, one scorpion, the largest of the group and presumably the alpha scorpion, kills all of the smaller ones, making it the last scorpion alive,...

Process: - Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine.  Question: suppose the government is disinterested happens, how will it affect in the thick liquid produced.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"C: No effect The process of digesting food is a biological function that primarily takes place within the human body's gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It does not correlate with any governmental processes or decisions. A disinterested government will not have a direct impact on the production of the thick liquid in the stomach, known as chyme. The digestion process begins when food enters the mouth, where it is broken down by chewing and mixed with saliva. As the food progresses down the esophagus through a series of muscular contractions called peristalsis, it reaches the stomach, where the bulk of the digestion occurs. The stomach's muscular walls churn the food, and stomach acids chemically break it down. This process transforms the food into a thick liquid consistency, called chyme. Chyme then moves into the small intestine, where it is mixed with bile from the liver and digestive enzymes from the pancreas. The small intestine is where nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream, and the remaining undigested materials continue into the large intestine for further processing and eventual elimination. In the context of a disinterested government, there will be no direct impact on an individual's digestive process. However, indirect consequences could arise from the government's lack of interest in certain areas. For example, a disinterested government may not prioritize food safety regulations, leading to an increased risk of consuming contaminated or unhealthy foods. Poor food regulation could result in an overall decline in health among citizens, including digestive issues, but this would not directly affect the production of chyme during the digestion process. Additionally, a disinterested government could disregard public healthcare policies, limiting people's access to medical care, nutritional advice, and the importance of healthy lifestyles, which could subsequently influence their overall health and well-being. Ultimately, these indirect consequences may contribute to a range of health issues, including those that affect the digestive system. However, the direct and immediate impact of a disinterested government on the production of chyme in an individual's stomach will be nonexistent. The process of chyme production occurs within the body and is not influenced by external factors such as government decisions and policies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Guidelines provided: 1. 80 households used neither brand A nor brand B soap. 2. 60 households used only brand A soap. 3. For every household that used both brands of soap, 3 households used only brand B soap. Let's use these guidelines to solve the task. Step 1: Find the total number of households that used only brand B or both brands of soap. We know that 80 households used neither brand, and 60 used only brand A. So, the remaining households either used only brand B or both: 260 (total households) - 80 (neither A nor B) - 60 (only A) = 120.  Step 2: Set up equations to find households that used both brands.  Let x be the number of households that used both brands of soap and y be the number of households that used only brand B soap. We have: x + y = 120 (from step 1, households using only B or both) Also, we know that for every household that used both brands, 3 households used only brand B soap. So, y = 3x. Step 3: Solve the equations. Substitute y = 3x into the first equation (x + y = 120): x + 3x = 120 4x = 120 x = 30 So, 30 households used both brands of soap.

Movie title: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner Context: \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" begins with Colin Smith (Tom Courtenay) running, alone, along a bleak country road somewhere in rural England. In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by \\"The Governor\\" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation program.As the Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences, we learn in a series of flashbacks how Colin came to be incarcerated. We see his difficult, economically strained family life in a lower-class workers' complex in industrial Nottingham. Without a job, Colin indulges in petty crimes in the company of his best friend, Mike (James Bolam).

Article: Rainy days don't have to get you down, a happiness expert has claimed. Paul Dolan, Professor of Behavioral Science at the London School of Economics, said that people only feel _ in bad weather because they think about it too much. Studies have shown that people who live in warm, sunny climates are no happier than those in chilly, wet climates, he says. So the British talking about the weather may be making us gloomier  than the weather itself. He said: \\"A study was done that measured the happiness levels of people in California compared to the North West. \\"They expected that people in California would be happier because it is more sunny, but they found that levels of happiness were exactly the same. \\"If it is sunny every day you get used to it and the sunshine doesn't make you any happier. \\"Most of the time the weather doesn't affect our well-being at all. But when we think about it, and think that it does, that's when we get miserable.\\" In his new book, Happiness By Design, Dolan argues that we can think ourselves happy by taking our attention away from what makes us sad. \\"Most of our anxieties come from what might be,\\" he argues. \\"If you want to be happier, pay attention to the things that make you feel good.\\" He also claimed that a problem shared was not always a problem halved. He claimed that humans are actually very good at being able to get over tragedy and loss. Professor Dolan also admitted for the first time that he had a stammer , which had made his early life miserable. He claimed it only got better when he learned not to pay attention to his speech problem. \\"Things are never as bad as you imagine them being,\\" he said. Question: People in California   _   compared to people in the North West. Answer: A:","output":"People in California are more used to sunny days (C) compared to people in the North West. According to the study mentioned in the article, happiness levels of people in California and the North West were found to be exactly the same. The consistent sunshine in California doesn't make its residents any happier in comparison to those living in the chillier, wetter climates of the North West. This implies that people get used to the weather conditions they live in, and thus, the sunny days in California become a normal part of life for its residents. The weather itself does not have a significant impact on one's well-being, and focusing too much on it can lead to feelings of misery. To increase their happiness, individuals should pay attention to the things that make them feel good instead of dwelling on factors that are believed to cause unhappiness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The previous 100 (Â£82) limit has been lifted, meaning most visitors could bring home up to 100 cigars and several bottles of rum. The latest measures reflect continuing moves by the former Cold War rivals to normalise relations after 53 years. President Barack Obama paid a historic visit to Cuba in March. What next for US-Cuba relations? Passengers on an 'emotional' crossing The latest raft of measures are in an administrative order by the president, meaning he can sidestep the Republican-controlled Congress. Analysts say he wants to cement the new trade relations before he leaves office in January. Other measures in the latest batch include: But the cigar and rum measures will be the most beneficial for Cuba. Given the high value of some cigars in particular, the Cuban government could benefit to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Analysis: Will Grant, BBC Cuba correspondent The most important announcement is probably the move to lift a restriction on cargo ship travel between the old enemies that had prevented them from docking in US ports for at least 180 days after visiting Cuba. But undoubtedly the most eye-catching was the decision to lift the 100 limit on rum and cigars. The fact that the record numbers of US visitors to Cuba can now buy much more is welcome news for the Castro government. That said, it will still reiterate its calls for the US economic embargo to be lifted entirely. The Cuban delegation plans to put a resolution in front of the UN General Assembly by the end of the month, which is likely to be resoundingly supported. President Obama cannot lift the embargo without the US Congress, but he can weaken it significantly. He has done that on several occasions over the past two years. Mr Obama said in a statement: \\"Challenges remain - and very real differences between our governments persist on issues of democracy and human rights - but I believe that engagement is the best way to address those differences and make progress on behalf of our interests and values.\\" More than 160,000 Americans went to Cuba in 2015 and the figure could double this year. In July, Cuba and the United States formally re-established relations. Summary:","output":"US President Barack Obama has removed trade restrictions on Cuban cigars and rum. The move lifts the previous 100 limit on Cuban goods brought back to the US, allowing travellers to bring back numerous bottles of rum and up to 100 cigars.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by. But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\"  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What will the Women's Haven be able to add with its grant money?\\" is \\"Add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services\\"?","output":"Yes, that is correct. With the 350,000 grant from the federal Violence Against Women Office, the Women's Haven of Tarrant County will be able to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. This funding will help bridge the gap for domestic-violence victims who are in need of legal assistance but do not qualify for free legal aid due to their financial status. By providing additional legal resources, the Women's Haven aims to support working-poor clients who struggle to afford legal representation in divorce and child custody cases, enabling them to escape potentially abusive situations and access the civil law system. Additionally, the partnership with Texas Wesleyan University's law school clinic will offer valuable experience for law students, who can assist with interviewing clients, handling initial intake work, and conducting investigations as part of their training."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision.  But I can use this background: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states.  What is an answer for this question: Which city is worse for Jennifer's health? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Malarn is likely worse for Jennifer's health due to the regular presence of a large amount of dust in the air from the desert located across the ocean. This dust negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. In comparison, Trainlan does not have any mentioned issues with air quality or factors that would negatively affect Jennifer's health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who is accused of being a devil?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Set in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue.

Write a summary based on this article: The Navy SEAL killed during combat in Somalia on Friday was Kyle Milliken, 38, a Falmouth native, the Department of Defense announced Saturday.      Milliken, a senior chief special warfare officer, was killed during an operation against the terrorist group al-Shabab in Barii, about 40 miles west of Mogadishu, the Somali capital. Two other service members were wounded, the Pentagon said Friday.      A Press Herald file photo shows Kyle Milliken (seated, front) with the state-record-setting Cheverus High School relay team in April 1998. Also pictured, standing from left, are Ryan Toothaker, Nick Nappi, and Ryan Demers. Staff photo by Doug Jones Related Headlines Navy SEALs one of U.S. military’s most elite forces      ‘Advise and assist’ mission took Falmouth SEAL into harm’s way      In a statement released through the Department of Defense, the Milliken family thanked the community for its interest but asked for privacy.      “He was a devoted father and son, a true professional and a wonderful husband,” the family said.      Milliken grew up in Falmouth and graduated in 1998 from Cheverus High School, where he was one of the school’s top track stars. He and three teammates set the record for the 1,600-meter relay for Class A schools in 1998, according to the Maine Principals’ Association.      “His former teachers, administrators, coaches and friends pray that eternal rest be granted to him, perpetual light shine upon him and that he rest in peace,” said the Rev. George E. Collins, president of Cheverus.      U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who represents Maine’s 1st District, which includes Falmouth, said in a statement that Milliken was “an amazing athlete who could do flips on skis and run for miles.”      SPECIALIZED IN FREE-FALL PARACHUTING      Milliken enlisted in the Navy in 2002 and quickly joined the special operations forces. He underwent special warfare training in Coronado, California, and specialized in free-fall parachuting.      He was based out of Virginia Beach, Virginia, starting in 2004. Milliken served combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and earned four Bronze Stars, among at least 30 medals and commendations.      “We were a nation at war when he enlisted,” said Capt. Jason Salata, spokesman for the Naval Special Warfare Command. “He has four Bronze Stars. You don’t get that from sitting at home. You’re getting those kind of awards for valor.”      According to Pingree, Milliken operated for many years with SEAL Team 6, an elite counterterrorism unit.      “May we never forget his extraordinary bravery and incredible sacrifice,” Pingree said.      Another member of Congress, Rep. Scott Taylor of Virginia, a former Navy SEAL whose district includes Virginia Beach, described Milliken as a “great friend, family man, and teammate” in a Facebook post Saturday afternoon. The fallen SEAL was “brilliant, witty and fiercely loyal,” Taylor wrote.      In a written statement late Saturday night, Gov. Paul LePage expressed condolences from himself and his wife, Ann, to Milliken’s family.      “On behalf of all Mainers, to the family and loved ones of Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator Kyle Milliken, there are no words that may provide comfort during this difficult time, but know he is a man we are forever indebted (to) for his service, sacrifice and protection of the freedoms we hold dear,” LePage said.      In a joint statement, U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King of Maine said they were deeply saddened to learn about Milliken’s death.      “He defended our nation with bravery and with distinction, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten,” the senators said.      Milliken was assigned to an East Coast-based special warfare unit that was supporting Somali National Army-led operations.      He was the first U.S. service member to die in Somalia since 1993, when 18 U.S. servicemen were killed after two helicopters were shot down over Mogadishu. Among them were two Mainers: Army Master Sgt. Gary Gordon of Lincoln and Army Staff Sgt. Thomas Field of Lisbon. The incident was recounted in the book and film “Black Hawk Down.”      “Senior Chief Kyle Milliken embodied the warrior spirit and toughness infused in our very best Navy SEALs,” said Rear Adm. Timothy Szymanski, commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command.      “We grieve his death, but we celebrate his life and many accomplishments. He is irreplaceable as a husband, father, son, friend and teammate – and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and teammates,” Szymanski said. “His sacrifice is a stark reminder that Naval Special Operators are forward doing their jobs, confronting terrorism overseas to prevent evil from reaching our shores.”      MILITARY TARGETS AL-SHABAB COMPOUND      Milliken was killed during a raid Friday on an al-Shabab compound. A firefight broke out after U.S. aircraft delivered Somali troops to the target area and U.S. troops were a distance back from the buildings, The Associated Press reported. The compound was targeted because it had been associated with attacks against U.S. and Somali forces.      Al-Shabab militants have been fighting the Somali government and foreign forces for almost a decade and are responsible for numerous terrorist attacks, including assaults against civilian targets in Kenya.      A Somali intelligence official told the AP that U.S. forces killed at least six people in the raid that targeted a building housing al-Shabab’s radio station and the dead included al-Shabab journalists.      The battle comes as the U.S. is intensifying military operations in Somalia. In late March, President Trump authorized expanded offensive airstrikes against al-Shabab and the deployment of dozens of regular troops to the country, the largest deployment in decades. The Pentagon had increased special forces activity and airstrikes in Somalia under President Barack Obama.      Somalia has been plagued by civil war since the government was overthrown in the early 1990s. The current national government is supported by the U.S. and an African Union peacekeeping force that is scheduled to leave the country in 2018.

Milliken was also a member of SEAL Team Six, the elite unit credited with killing Osama bin Laden in 2011, and he earned four Bronze Stars in Iraq and Afghanistan.      \\"We grieve his death, but we celebrate his life and many accomplishments,\\" Syzmanksi said in a statement. \\"He is irreplaceable as a husband, father, son, friend and teammate — and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and teammates.”      Milliken is the first U.S. service member to be killed in action in Somalia since the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu that led to the death of 18 service members and wounded 73 others — an event that inspired the book and later Hollywood film, \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"      Related: Trump’s Army Secretary Pick Mark Green Withdraws Name From Consideration      Milliken was part of the operation that had been coordinated between the Somali National Army and U.S. Africa Command. He first joined the Navy in 2002 and was assigned to an East Coast-based special warfare unit as a SEAL.      Milliken and two others were injured in Thursday's attack and were medevaced to neighboring Djibouti, but Milliken died of his wounds. While the U.S. military is still analyzing intelligence to find out if the targets of the mission were among the dead, the Somali government declared it a victory.      Omar Mohamud Elmi, the deputy governor of the Lower Shabelle region in Somalia, said the aim of the operation was to \\"surgically target\\" two elements: senior members of al-Shabab hiding in the area and a pro-al-Shabab media station.      \\"The joint operation, the special operation, has successfully carried out a surgical strike on these two main elements killing many of the terrorists,\\" Elmi said.      There are currently 50 American special forces members working in Somalia as part of the African Union mission. They are collaborating with local national commandos to “train and advise,” which is part of a ramped up effort to fight al-Shabab, an al Qaeda-allied group that has imposed Sharia law in areas of the country under its control.      President Donald Trump approved the use of aggressive airstrikes and military operations to fight the group last month. ||||| Summary:","output":"Kyle Milliken, a 38-year-old Navy SEAL from Maine, was killed during an operation against terrorist group al-Shabab in Somalia. Milliken was part of a team that came under fire from al-Shabab fighters in an area around 40 miles west of the capital, Mogadishu. Two other Navy SEALS were injured in the skirmish. Milliken was a 15-year veteran and a member of the elite SEAL Team Six, responsible for killing Osama bin Laden in 2011. He was the first US service member to be killed in action in Somalia since the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph:   In the 1920s, physicists discovered that electrons do not travel in fixed paths. In fact, they found that electrons only have a certain chance of being in any particular place. They could only describe where electrons are with mathematical formulas. That’s because electrons have wave-like properties as well as properties of particles of matter. It is the \\"wave nature\\" of electrons that lets them exist only at certain distances from the nucleus. The negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus. However, because the electrons behave like waves, they bend around the nucleus instead of falling toward it. Electrons exist only where the wave is stable. These are the orbitals. They do not exist where the wave is not stable. These are the places between orbitals.   Q: Electrons exist only where the wave is what?   Choices:  - seen  - spinning  - solid  - stable  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"Electrons exist only where the wave is stable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Sorcerer's Apprentice Movie plot: The events that unfold prior to the main timeline in the movie are introduced in narration (uncredited Ian McShane), and takes us to 700 AD. The famous and powerful wizard Merlin (James A. Stephens) had three apprentices to whom he entrusted all of his knowledge of magic and cast spells over them to ensure they didn't age. However, one of his apprentices, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), betrayed Merlin for his greatest enemy, the sorceress Morgana (Alice Krige). The other two apprentices, Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) and Veronica (Monica Bellucci) arrive at Merlin's stronghold in time to learn of the deception and discover that Morgana was attempting to steal a spell from Merlin's spell book that would allow her to awaken dead wizards and sorcerers and rule the world, The Rising.Morgana overpowers Merlin with Horvath's help and fatally wounds him before retrieving the evil spell. Balthazar and Veronica duel with Morgana while Horvath escapes. As a last resort, Veronica uses a spell to absorb Morgana's soul into her own body to stop her but Morgana begins to kill Veronica from the inside. To ensure Veronica's survival Balthazar traps her, with Morgana, in the Grimhold, a large nesting doll. Both facades of Veronica and Morgana are displayed on the outer shell. Before he dies, Merlin tells Balthazar that he must find the child that will be born endowed with all of his powers, the Prime Merlinian, and gives him a small, metal dragon; a symbol of his magic. The Prime Merlinian will be the only one to stop Morgana. Balthazar searches the globe for the Merlinian, with no success. Over time, he battles evil sorcerers and adds them, in layers, to the Grimhold until, finally, he captures Horvath and seals him in the outermost layer.Centuries pass to the year 2000.

Rolfe first examined the bedroom that he had seen Inspector Chippenfield enter.  It was a small room, containing a double bed.  It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match.  A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it.  The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.  There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath.  Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom.  This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses.  Plainly, there was no place in it where a man could hide himself.  The next room was the bathroom, which was also empty.  Opposite the bathroom was a small bedroom, very barely furnished, offering no possibility of concealment.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"No, those questions are not the same. Here's an explanation to help you understand them better. First question: \\"Is Spotify the next Napster?\\" Spotify is a popular music streaming service where we can listen to a lot of songs by paying a monthly fee or using it for free with ads. Napster was an early way to share songs on the internet, but it got into trouble because it didn't have permission from the people who made the music. Even though both are about listening to music, they are not the same thing. Spotify follows rules and shares money with musicians, while Napster caused problems for musicians and was shut down. Second question: \\"What is the history of Napster?\\" Napster was a program for sharing music files, mainly MP3s, on the internet. It started in 1999, when two college students created it to make it easy for people to search and download songs. However, many artists and music companies got upset because they did not get paid for their music, and Napster was breaking rules about copyrights. They took Napster to court, and eventually, Napster was shut down in 2001. Nowadays, there are different ways to listen to music legally, like Spotify."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ROH-z@-velt; October 27, 1858 - January 6, 1919) was an American statesman and writer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. In the 1896 presidential election, Roosevelt backed Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed for the Republican nomination, but William McKinley won the nomination and defeated William Jennings Bryan in the general election. Roosevelt opposed Bryan's free silver platform, viewing many of Bryan's followers as dangerous fanatics, and Roosevelt gave campaign speeches for McKinley. Urged by Congressman Henry Cabot Lodge, President McKinley appointed Roosevelt as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897. Secretary of the Navy John D. Long was more concerned about formalities than functions, was in poor health, and left many major decisions to Roosevelt. Influenced by Alfred Thayer Mahan, Roosevelt called for a build-up in the country's naval strength, particularly the construction of battleships. Roosevelt also began pressing his national security views regarding the Pacific and the Caribbean on McKinley, and was particularly adamant that Spain be ejected from Cuba. He explained his priorities to one of the Navy's planners in late 1897:  I would regard war with Spain from two viewpoints: first, the advisability on the grounds both of humanity and self-interest of interfering on behalf of the Cubans, and of taking one more step toward the complete freeing of America from European dominion; second, the benefit done our people by giving them something to think of which is not material gain, and especially the benefit done our military forces by trying both the Navy and Army in actual practice.  On February 15, 1898, the Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, killing hundreds of crew members. While Roosevelt and many other Americans blamed Spain for the explosion, McKinley sought a diplomatic solution. Without approval from Long or McKinley, Roosevelt sent out orders to several naval vessels, directing them to prepare for war. George Dewey, who had received an appointment to lead the Asiatic Squadron with the backing of Roosevelt, later credited his victory at the Battle of Manila Bay to Roosevelt's orders. After finally giving up hope of a peaceful solution, McKinley asked Congress to declare war upon Spain, beginning the Spanish-American War.

It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Meanwhile, at the construction site where Jim is working, his Lloyd is killed from fallen sheetrock by the murderous spirit. After Jim is questioned by Lieutenant Dewhurst at At Lloyd's funeral, she again contacts Malfeitor (still believing to be David) about the accident, and the spirit lies that he did not cause it. Soon, Linda begins to fall under progressive entrapment, in which the spirit changes and starts to terrorize the user, rendering the person weak and easy to possess. Brandon brings over a psychic medium named Sarah \\"Zarabeth\\" Crawford to contact David, and if necessary to exorcise him from the building. The spirit puts up little resistance and leaves, but after leaving, Zarabeth is suspicious and wants to research the occurrence. Not long after getting home, she is attacked and killed by Malfeitor; her throat is slashed before being thrown out of a window and impaled onto a spike. The next morning, Brandon is shocked to hear about Zarabeth's death on the newscast, and immediately suspects the spirit David murdered her. After Brandon leaves for more information, Linda is unconscious by Malfeitor and she is sent to a hospital after Jim contacts an ambulance. During this time, Brandon and Jim conduct research on David, and later initially accuse the spirit of terrorizing Linda.... My question: Who's tires did David slash?

Police in Pamplona are searching for a bull runner who they believe snapped a selfie as he ran just inches ahead of several charging bulls weighing more than a half a tonne each.      As the young man slowed to take a photo in one of the final stretches of the fifth bull run of the San Fermín festival on Friday, he was captured on camera by several Spanish media. He now faces a fine of up to €3,000 under regulations passed this year by the city of Pamplona. The regulations, designed to crack down on dangerous behaviour during the festival, prohibit the unauthorised use of any kind of recording device during the bull runs.      The festival, which traces its roots back to the 13th century, has come under pressure in recent years to fight back against daredevils as its global profile increases. Images of the thousands of runners dressed in red and white as they tear through the narrow streets of Pamplona pursued by stampeding bulls have now become commonplace in foreign media, and tens of thousands of Spanish and foreign tourists descend on the city to take part in the festival's nine days of alcohol-fuelled partying and bull runs.      As pictures of the man circulated on social networks under the hashtag #eltontolmóvil, meaning the idiot with the mobile, many criticised his lack of respect for the other participants in the run. El Mundo's José Luis Vadillo wrote that the photo was \\"one of the best examples of human stupidity I've ever seen\\", pointing out that he had put other runners in tremendous danger.      Fifteen people have been killed in the festival since record-keeping began in the early 1900s. Dozens more are injured each year in the festival, most of them during the panicked chaos of the morning bull runs. ||||| Alex Dunham · 11 Jul 2014, 16:33      Published: 11 Jul 2014 16:33 GMT+02:00      A participant in Friday's running of the bulls in the Spanish city of Pamplona may be slapped with a €3,000 (4,100) fine after he dared to take a selfie just inches away from a group of charging San Fermin bulls.      Authorities in the northern region of Navarre have passed a bylaw this year aimed at clamping down on the usage of filming devices during the treacherous ‘encierros’ (running of the bulls).      So far three people, all of them British citizens, have been fined.      One of the men had to pay €200 for crossing a security line (despite his claims that the information was only announced via megaphone in Spanish and Euskera) whereas another Brit had to cough up €650 for filming the bull run with a drone.      If anyone does seriously disturb the encierro and put other people’s lives in danger by filming or taking pictures while running with the bulls, they will have to pay €3,000.      The daredevil in the photo above may be the first to have to do so after Spanish public television TVE filmed him taking a selfie with his phone as the 700-kilo bulls came within centimetres of goring him.      Ironically, TVE producers have got themselves into a spot of trouble after they encouraged participants to “send their best San Fermin selfies in to win a prize”.      Since the controversial photo above went viral, they have tweeted: “Be careful, we didn’t quite mean that” in response.      San Fermin has become a global tourist attraction, with tens of thousands of Spaniards and foreigners pouring into the Navarran capital.      Many bull run participants take part after drinking and dancing almost all night.      Fifteen people have been killed in the bull runs since records began in 1911. The most recent death occurred five years ago when a Spanish man was gored.      Story continues below…      Four Spaniards and one American have been gored so far this year in the festival, which wraps up on Monday.      A 2011 study by Pamplona city hall found that of the 20,500 people who took part in the festival's eight bull runs that year, only six percent were women.      Nearly half of the people who took part in the bull runs that year came from outside Spain, mostly from Australia, Britain and the United States. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A man participating in Pamplona's San Fermín festival is facing a fine of up to €3,000 for taking a selfie while running just inches ahead of several charging bulls.

Please answer a question about the following article about Beyoncé: On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé married Jay Z. She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \\"Crazy in Love\\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" and the top-five songs \\"If I Were a Boy\\" and \\"Halo\\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \\"Halo\\"'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \\"Sweet Dreams\\", and singles \\"Diva\\", \\"Ego\\", \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" and \\"Video Phone\\". The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \\"first major dance craze\\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more pollution occurs happens, how will it affect less air in the lungs available.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased pollution can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of air intake and respiration. Direct effects: When air pollution increases, the air we breathe contains more harmful particles and chemicals. These pollutants can be inhaled through the mouth and enter the lungs, mixing with the air inside the lungs. This may cause inflammation, irritation, or damage to the lung tissues. As a result, the air sacs in the lungs may not fill with as much oxygen, reducing the efficiency of the oxygen transfer process. Additionally, the pollutants might hinder the effective removal of carbon dioxide from the lungs, potentially leading to respiratory problems or reduced lung function. Indirect effects: Increased air pollution can also impact the environment and climate on a larger scale, leading to changes in air quality and weather patterns. This may indirectly influence the amount and quality of the air available for humans to breathe, further exacerbating any negative effects on the respiratory system. Overall, increased air pollution can negatively impact the efficiency of the respiratory process, leading to less air and oxygen available in the lungs, and potentially causing various respiratory issues or long-term health consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, that time has come. The \\"Mexican food\\" chain is testing a Waffle Taco at three Southern California restaurants, and the Los Angeles Times reports that it's pretty popular already (or maybe just novel): On Tuesday, a \\"steady stream\\" of people ordered as many as 10 or more of the 89-cent \\"tacos\\" (a waffle folded around a sausage patty folded around some scrambled eggs, served with a side of syrup) at a time at one location. Gawker suggests we call it the \\"wafflaco.\\" The Times found the waffle too \\"mushy\\" and the sausage too \\"rubbery,\\" but the Instagrammer who first broke the news of the Waffle Taco tagged it, #itsdelicious. Delicious it may be, but many are wondering: Is it really a taco? The Consumerist sums it up with this headline: \\"Is The 'Waffle Taco' Really A Taco, Or Just A Folded Waffle With Stuff In It?\\" And on BuzzFeed, Erin La Rosa points out that almost anything can be folded in half and called a taco, including your hand folded around some ice cream and chocolate syrup. You may soon be able to judge for yourself: If the Waffle Taco is a success, \\"we'll roll it out to all of our restaurants that serve breakfast,\\" a Taco Bell rep tells USA Today.

The Waffle Taco features a waffle folded around a sausage patty and scrambled eggs served with a side of syrup, priced at just 89 cents. According to the Los Angeles Times, a steady stream of curious customers are already flocking to try this unique food item. One Taco Bell location reported that individuals ordered up to 10 or more Waffle Tacos at a time. The term \\"wafflaco\\" has been coined by Gawker to represent this distinct menu offering. Despite the excitement surrounding the Waffle Taco, not everyone is convinced that it qualifies as a true taco. The Times' review suggested that the waffle was too mushy and the sausage too rubbery. Meanwhile, The Consumerist poses the question: \\"Is the 'Waffle Taco' really a taco, or just a folded waffle with stuff in it?\\" BuzzFeed's Erin La Rosa also chimed in, highlighting how virtually any item can be folded in half and deemed a taco, even a hand folded around ice cream and chocolate syrup.  Should the Waffle Taco prove to be a hit among customers, Taco Bell has plans to expand its availability. A representative of the company shared with USA Today, \\"If the Waffle Taco is a success, we'll roll it out to all of our restaurants that serve breakfast.\\" This innovative breakfast option is part of the ever-evolving fast food landscape, with other chains like Burger King also introducing new items, such as their version of the McRib. Regardless of whether the Waffle Taco is granted the \\"taco\\" label or not, the buzz and interest surrounding this item demonstrates the ongoing allure of inventive fast food menu offerings.

'' The divide has long been a place steeped in mystery and rich with cultural significance. For generations, the native tribes living in the surrounding areas have passed down stories and legends that speak of powerful forces that reside within the divide. These stories have connected the tribes to the divide in a way that has defined their existence, and helped to shape their understanding of the world around them. Billie's assertion that people connected to activity on the divide have always been like \\"us\\" speaks to the bond shared by the individuals belonging to these native tribes. By identifying themselves as \\"native American,\\" or \\"first peoples,\\" they are reinforcing the notion that they are connected to a deep history and ancient lineage that predates the arrival of European settlers in the Americas. Confusion can arise for outsiders, as the cultural intricacies and ancient knowledge of the divide have traditionally been passed down orally through generations and are thus not widely known or documented. The native tribes possess a unique understanding of the divide, thanks to the stories, rituals, and practices that they have inherited from their ancestors. This understanding is grounded in the belief that they are the descendants of the very first people to inhabit the land surrounding the divide. The mention of the protagonist's ability, one that apparently has not been encountered among non-Native individuals, suggests that there could be something unique or special about their connection to the divide as well. This raises intriguing questions about the possible influence that ancestral lineage, cultural context, and mythology play in determining both the nature of one's abilities and their relationship to the divide. It is also fascinating to consider the ways in which mythology associated with the divide has possibly shaped and influenced the lives of those who live near it. For the native tribes, these mythological stories provide a framework for understanding the world and their place within it, as well as a shared cultural identity that unites them across different tribes. In this passage, we see that an individual's connection to the divide may depend, at least in part, on whether they belong to a native tribe. Those who do not share this lineage may find it difficult to comprehend or interpret the significance of the divide and the activities that take place there. Ultimately, the divide serves as a powerful symbol that enriches the culture of the native tribes while also connecting them to a complex and profound history. Through the exploration of the connections between ancestry, mythology, and understanding of the divide, the text invites us to consider the ways in which these elements intertwine to shape, define, and preserve the collective identity of the first peoples."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Whitewater, usually spelled white water in both American and British English, is formed in a rapid, when a river's gradient increases enough to create so much turbulence that air is entrained into the water body, that is, it forms a bubbly or aerated and unstable current; the frothy water appears white. The term is also loosely used to refer to less turbulent, but still agitated, flows.  - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\").  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of   - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\".  - The Whataroa River, sometimes the Wataroa River, is a river in the southern West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island. Its source is in the Southern Alps and it flows north and northwest, passing the township of Whataroa on the eastern side before reaching the Tasman Sea just south of Abut Head. The river is fed by many tributaries, such as the Perth River, and is crossed by State Highway 6 on its route between Whataroa and Te Taho.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.  - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate.  - A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake. They may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples include vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make their home in ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.  - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\".  - The Perth River is a river located in the Southern Alps in the West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island. Its source is in terrace icefields north of the Rangitata Divide and is joined by multiple tributaries, including a creek from Abel Lake. It features a number of rapids and passes through two gorges before meeting the Whataroa River. The river is largely inaccessible, but recently, an adventure tourism company has begun offering \\"heli-rafting\\" on the river: whitewater rafters are flown in by helicopter to raft the river. Kayakers have been flying (\\"heli-boating\\") up the Perth for a number of years. The normal rafting put in at Five-Finger stream gives a nice class III-IV run with one amazing gorge. By flying up to Scone Hut, the trip becomes one of the best IV-V runs on the coast. More recently paddlers have been flying or walking upstream of scone hut for some V-V+ excitement.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - In geography, temperate or tepid latitudes of Earth lie between the tropics and the polar regions. The temperatures in these regions are generally relatively moderate, rather than extremely hot or cold, and the changes between summer and winter are also usually moderate.  - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.  - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.  - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.  - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.  - Abel Lake is a small lake in the Westland region of the South Island of New Zealand . It is located in the Southern Alps , 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) east of Franz Josef and is fed by the Abel Glacier . A short stream links the lake with the Perth River .  - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.

Summarize this article: Prior to starting any weight loss or diet program, it's ideal to speak to your doctor or even with a registered dietitian. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether your diet program is safe and healthy for you.  They may also be able to provide you with additional guidance or recommend alternatives that might be more appropriate for your health. A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that may give you a more effective diet for weight loss. They can create a meal plan for you that will help induce weight loss in addition to guiding you towards healthy foods to help you lose weight. Visit the EatRight website and click on the orange \\"Find an Expert\\" button on the top right to search for a dietitian in your area. In order to lose weight, you'll most likely need to cut out extra calories from your diet. Safe weight loss, or losing 1-2 pounds per week, requires you to cut out or burn off about 500-1000 calories daily.  It is not recommended to cut out more than 500-1000 calories from your diet daily. You run the risk of being unable to meet your nutrient goals. Although weight loss and healthy eating go beyond calories, it's important to be calorie aware - knowing whether or not you're eating enough calories for your body and lifestyle. You can combine cutting calories with exercise to maximize how large your calorie deficit is daily. Studies show that consuming adequate protein helps support weight loss in addition to keeping you feeling satisfied.  Include lean proteins such as:  poultry, beef, pork, eggs, dairy products, legumes and tofu. In general, it’s recommended for women to consume 46 g of protein daily and men to consume 56 g daily.  This recommendation is easily met if you consume about 3-4 oz of protein at each meal. That's about the size of a deck of cards or the palm of your hand or about 1/2 cup of items like beans or lentils. Fruits and vegetables are high in nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals and are also low in calories. Making half of your plate a fruit or vegetable helps cut down on your overall caloric intake.  Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables each day. Choosing a different colored fruit or vegetable is an easy way to eat different vitamins and antioxidants. In general, aim for about 1-2 servings of fruit a day (about 1 small fruit or 1/2 cup of sliced fruit per serving) and at least 3-4 servings of vegetables (1 cup or 2 cups leafy vegetables per  serving). Keep in mind that you can eat extra vegetables without throwing off your diet. In fact, eating more vegetables may help you to feel full and make it easier stick with your diet. Whole grains are an excellent source of fiber and a few vitamins and minerals. If choosing to eat grains, aim to choose whole grains when possible.  Whole grains are an unprocessed grain. They contain the hull, germ and endosperm parts of the grain.  Whole grains include: brown rice, 100% whole wheat pasta, oats, quinoa and 100% whole grain breads. Popcorn is also considered a whole grain. Having the occasional healthy snack is appropriate when you're trying to lose weight. In addition, a snack may even help support your weight loss efforts.  If you really want to snack, think about whether it's necessary. A low-calorie snack can be a good option when there's more than 4-5 hours between meals, before or after a workout or you're feeling very hungry and there's more than 2 hours until your next meal.  Try to keep your snacks between 100-200 calories. This will help get you to your next meal without blowing your daily calorie budget. Including fruits, vegetables and lean protein help keep snacks calorie-controlled while still being nutritious.  Healthy snacks can include: cottage cheese and fruit, 2 hard boiled eggs, 1/3 cup of trail mix, or air-popped popcorn without butter. Staying hydrated can also aid in weight loss. Aim to drink about 64 oz or 8 glasses of clear, sugar-free liquids daily. Although this is a general rule of thumb, it's a good place to start.  Even mild, chronic dehydration can slow weight loss. When you're dehydrated or feeling thirsty, many times this feels like hunger. This could be triggering you to eat, when you just need a few sips of water.  Keep track of how much water or other fluids you consume daily by keeping a labeled water bottle near by. You can decrease or manage portion sizes by drinking a large glass of water right before your meal. This may help make you feel satiated a bit sooner. Avoid sweetened beverages. Avoiding soda, fruit juice, punch, sports drinks, energy drinks, kool-aide, sweet tea, lemonade, sweetened coffees, etc. can make a huge impact on your daily calorie intake. You may even lose weight just by eliminating these drinks. Going out for a bite to eat is something that's fun, social and can be included even on a weight loss plan. Be careful about the items you choose and try to pick a meal that will fit into your overall eating pattern.  Restaurant foods can be higher in calories, fat and sodium compared to homemade foods.  Many times, this is due to sauces, dressings, marinades or added oils or butter. Ask to have these things served on the side. Pass on the starch. Eating only protein and a vegetable may help keep your overall calorie levels low. Choose an appetizer portion or a kids portion to help minimize larger portion sizes that are served at restaurants. Limit or skip the alcohol and desserts. These can be significant sources of extra calories when you go out to eat. For example, a frozen margarita can have 675 calories and a slice of molten lava cake may be over 1,100 calories! Summary:","output":"Before starting a weight loss program, consult your doctor or a registered dietitian to ensure the diet is safe and appropriate for your needs. To lose weight, aim to cut out or burn 500-1000 calories daily, but do not exceed this amount. Incorporate lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into your meals, aiming for 1-2 servings of fruit, 3-4 servings of vegetables, and about 46 g of protein daily for women and 56 g for men. Ensure you stay hydrated, aiming for 64 oz of clear, sugar-free liquids daily, and avoid sweetened beverages. Choose healthy portion sizes and consider snacking on low-calorie options between meals. When eating out, select meals that fit into your eating plan, request sauces and dressings on the side, and opt for smaller portion sizes. Limit or avoid alcohol and dessert when dining out to reduce calorie intake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

I like this girl. We went out couple of times. She says she likes me, but she is not emotionally available for a relationship. What should I do? Do those questions have the same meaning? Possible answers: [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"The two questions you've presented have similar situations, but they are not exactly the same in meaning.  For the first question, it appears that the girl is genuinely interested in being in a relationship with you, but she wants to wait for a better time to start a relationship. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as personal issues, work, or other factors that might be occupying her thoughts at the moment. She may need more time to settle her emotions and mental state before committing to a relationship, but her feelings for you seem to be true. On the other hand, the second question presents a girl who states she likes you, yet she is not emotionally available for a relationship. This can imply that although she may have feelings for you, she may not be in a mental or emotional state to invest in a relationship. The reasons for her emotional unavailability could be similar to the first, such as unresolved personal issues or other factors that might be affecting her overall well-being. While both questions tackle the same general theme of emotional readiness for a relationship, they do differ in the girls' attitudes towards the possibility of a serious commitment in the near future. In the first question, the girl acknowledges her feelings for you and wants to pursue a relationship, albeit at a more suitable time. In the second, the girl may not be certain of wanting a relationship, as her emotional unavailability may prevent her from being fully invested in a partnership. Considering the differences between these questions, the appropriate answer is [i] no. As for advice in handling each situation, here are my suggestions: 1. For the first question, it is essential to respect the girl's decision to wait until she believes it's the right time to jump into a relationship. Show understanding and patience, and assure her that you will be there to support her as she works through her personal challenges. Maintain open communication and keep a positive attitude, as this can help strengthen your bond when she finally feels ready to commit to a relationship. 2. For the second question, you can try communicating with her about her emotional unavailability and understand the possible reasons behind it. Although she may like you, it's essential to ascertain whether she is open to resolving her issues and becoming emotionally ready for a relationship. It is crucial to respect her boundaries, but if she expresses interest in growing as an individual and overcoming her emotional barriers, you can offer support and help her throughout this process. However, if she remains emotionally unavailable and is not sure about her feelings for you, it might be best to distance yourself from her emotionally for your own well-being until she feels ready to move forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On my way home I pass Bonne Nouvelle station in the heart of Paris's cinema district. There, during the cinema festival this summer, special lighting effects dot the platforms and films are projected onto the large advertising boards. More than anything the metro is efficient. \\"When I worked on line 4\\", says a retired driver, \\"we had exactly 30 minutes and 15 seconds to complete the journey. If it took any longer, they cut our pay.\\" But there are problems. Many Metro stations have too many stairs, and changing lines at big interchanges  can be tiresome. Moscow Passengers carried per day: 9m Cost of ticket: 12p Length: 164 miles    Lines: 11   Stations: 162 The first underground passage for the Moscow Metropolitan started in 1932. Three years later the trains started running. They haven't stopped since-- every 90 seconds or two minutes during rush hour, every five minutes the rest of the time, from 6 a.m. till 1 a. m. There may be a crowd of people but there is seldom a wait. The trains take you through spacious and spotless stations. For tourists it's a major sightseeing attraction: from Russian Art Deco to neo-classical, the Metro stations are not to be missed. Tokyo Passengers carried per day: 7m Cost of ticket: 90p ~ PS1.68 Length: 177 miles    Lines: 12   Stations: 209 Trains do not just arrive on time in Tokyo. They stop right on the platform mark so that passengers can line up knowing exactly where the doors will open.

Question: How old is Josh? Movie plot title: The Graduates Movie plot: When four high school buddies hit the beach for a last summertime fling before they go their separate ways, bogus guidance from a booze-buying pal and their own half-baked schemes put the brakes on their dreams of unlimited beer and uncensored babes. But as their hormone-driven plans unravel, they discover what it means to have and be true friends.The Graduates is a surprisingly touching, hysterical and smart revival of the classic coming-of-age comedy.Ben convinces his older brother to drive his best friends to the beach in Ocean City, Maryland for one last hurrah before they all leave for college in the fall. Josh, almost 30, agrees in hopes of scoring some young high school tail while \\"between jobs.\\"Ben chases his high school crush all over town, while his rag-tag friends get in fights, strike out, torment the town and break most municipal laws for kids under 21.Just as Ben is about to bed Annie, her meat-head ex boyfriend Jesse Swomley shows up in Ocean City, looking for Annie and Ready to fight anyone who stands in his way.The Graduates is part satire, part coming-of-age comedy, and part autobiography of the writer/director Ryan Gielen. Featuring a ton of young talent, the film and soundtrack are a hysterical and touching trip down memory lane for anyone who remembers those final summer days of youth, those fleeting moments between youth and adulthood, when we're lost and searching and yearning.Four stars.

Second question: When was the first Dam built? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: (i). no; (ii). yes;","output":"First, I will answer the two questions provided: 1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of dams? Advantages of dams: - Flood control: Dams help regulate river flow, preventing flooding in downstream areas. - Water storage: Dams store water, which can be used for irrigation, human consumption, and industrial purposes. - Hydroelectric power generation: Dams convert the potential energy of water stored in a reservoir to electricity, providing a sustainable and renewable energy source. - Recreation: Many dams create large reservoirs or lakes, which are popular destinations for boating, fishing, and other forms of recreation. Disadvantages of dams: - Environmental impacts: Building and maintaining dams can disrupt local ecosystems, including fish migration, sediment flow, and water quality. - Displacement of people and communities: The creation of large reservoirs can result in the flooding of fertile agricultural lands, forests, and human settlements. - High costs and risks: Dams are expensive to build, maintain, and decommission, and their failure can have catastrophic consequences for downstream areas. - Sedimentation and reduced lifespan: Over time, sediment accumulates in reservoirs, reducing their storage capacity and water flow, eventually leading to a decline in the functionality of the dam. 2. When was the first dam built? The first known dam was built around 2900 BCE in Egypt. It was called the Sadd el-Kafara Dam and was constructed by ancient Egyptians in the Wadi Al-Garawi in southern Egypt. Now, to determine if the two questions are asking the same thing: Are these two questions asking the same thing? (i). no Explanation: The first question focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of dams, while the second question asks about the timeframe of the first dam construction. These are two separate topics, so the questions are not asking the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: This article: Paige Collins and her husband Leo come out of a movie theater. On their way home, at a stop sign, Paige unbuckles her seatbelt to lean over and kiss Leo. At that very moment, a truck rams their car from behind and Paige crashes through the windshield. Both of them are rushed to the emergency room, and as Leo, in a voice-over talks about how \\"moments of impact help in finding who we are\\" the movie cuts to how Paige and Leo first met. The scenes of how they courted, became engaged and married at the Art Institute of Chicago and share a kiss under the Cloud Gate are interwoven with the present. When Paige regains consciousness, she thinks Leo is her doctor, having lost all memories of the past few years. When her wealthy parents, Bill and Rita Thornton, learn about this, they visit her. This is the first time that Leo meets them, and they do not appreciate Leo taking their daughter, and not being informed. Paige does not understand why he would not have met her parents, after having been married to her. She finds it even stranger that he did not know why either. Nor did she understand why she left law school, broke her engagement with her previous fiancé, Jeremy, and why she has not been in touch with her family and friends. Her parents insist on taking her home with them and Paige agrees, thinking she might have married Leo for some mutual benefit. She seeks evidence of the marriage. Just as she is about to leave, Leo comes running to play her a voice message in which she sounds very happy and romantic. Paige decides to go back with Leo, hoping it will help her regain her lost memory. Paige is welcomed home with a surprise party by her friends, but as she is not able to remember any of them, she finds it overwhelming and is extremely confused. contains an answer for the question: What's the first name of the person Jeremy was once engaged to?, what is it ?

Article: Never use cold water, ice baths, or rubbing alcohol. A fever must be brought down gradually, and these methods will reduce body temperature too rapidly and may cause additional health problems. Moreover, rubbing alcohol comes with the additional risk of alcohol poisoning, which may occur if the alcohol is absorbed through the skin. Make sure your baby is dressed in lightweight fabrics, and keep layers to a minimum. Extra layers will likely trap the excess body heat produced by your baby's fever, causing your baby to stay too warm and encouraging the fever to continue rising. If your baby starts to shiver, however, you may need to add an extra layer to prevent him or her from catching a chill. A little dampness may not cause much damage, but a thoroughly drenched garment may cause your baby to catch a chill, which will only complicate your child's illness. Shivering is a tell-tale sign that your child needs additional coverage to stay warm. Blankets make a good choice because they are easier to remove and adjust than clothing. Never use heavy-weight blankets, however, since these will only cause your infant's body temperature to increase. It is a good sign if your child is still interested in playing, but too much physical activity will only cause the body’s internal temperature to continue climbing. Keep your baby indoors and relatively sedate. Preventing dehydration is an important part of fighting a fever. Infants under six months of age should only receive breast milk or formula, but you may consider supplementing this with small amounts of water, natural fruit juice, or gelatin and popsicles made with natural fruit juice to babies over six months. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: To safely manage a baby's fever, avoid using cold water, ice baths, or rubbing alcohol as they can cause additional health issues.

Answer the question A rock sample will most likely contain Select from:  * plants.;  * minerals.;  * water.;  * wood.;","output":"To answer this question, let us analyze each option: 1. Plants: Rocks are not typically formed from plant material. Instead, plants grow in soil, which is a mixture of organic matter and small rock particles. Thus, it's less likely for a rock sample to contain plants. 2. Minerals: Rocks are naturally occurring solid substances that are made of minerals. Minerals are the basic building blocks of rocks, and the proportion and arrangement of these minerals determine the rock's characteristics. Thus, a rock sample will most likely contain minerals. 3. Water: Although some rocks, like porous rocks, can contain water within their pores, it's not a guaranteed component of all rocks. So, a rock sample might contain water, but it's not the most likely option 4. Wood: Wood is a natural substance derived from plants, particularly from the trunk or branches of trees. It's very unlikely for a rock sample to contain wood as they are not formed from the same materials.

The pant had become uncomfortable and stiff after a prolonged period of sitting; it made his legs feel restricted, and the fabric seemed to have grown cold, clammy against his skin. He couldn't take it any longer – he needed to change into something more comfortable, especially if he were to tackle the remainder of the day's tasks. As Bill slipped into his shorts, he immediately felt a sense of relief wash over him. The soft, lightweight fabric allowed his skin to breathe easily, and the freedom of movement made him feel as if he'd shed an invisible layer of stress along with his formal attire. The contrast between the coldness of his pant and the warmth from his shorts couldn't go unnoticed by Bill. While wearing the shorts, Bill realized that he could go about his day without the distractions or mental baggage that often accompanied the uncomfortable, formal clothing he had to wear for his interview. He was eager to head outside and make the most of this newfound comfort and motivation. As he stepped out into the world, Bill was met with a crisp, cool breeze that seemed to seep into his pores and reinvigorate him completely. His shorts allowed the sun's rays to provide a gentle warmth while the wind sent shivers up his spine. The feeling of the elements against his formerly covered skin sent a thrill through him, and he knew that he was ready to seize the day like never before. Bill briskly walked through the park near his home, allowing nature to fully embrace him as he began rediscovering the beauty of the world around him. The colors seemed more vibrant, the air fresher, and he could hear the sweet melody of birds singing above him as he strolled. He marveled at how this simple act of wearing shorts had not only changed his physical comfort but his perception of the world around him as well. As the day continued, Bill managed to accomplish all the tasks he'd been putting off or avoiding, feeling an almost inexhaustible supply of energy. Even though his shorts were still cold from the breeze, Bill found the freshness of the outdoors invigorating, making him feel alive and more in tune with his surroundings. The experience of this enlightening day led Bill to realize the impact that something as seemingly insignificant as the clothes he wore could have on his overall mood, productivity, and connection to the world around him. From that day on, he vowed to live more mindfully, to find balance in his life, and to appreciate the seemingly small moments and decisions that truly shaped his existence.

Additionally, it is essential to rinse them thoroughly under cold, running water to remove dirt and excess phytic acids that may have been released during soaking. 2. Prepping the ingredients: While the seeds and nuts are being rinsed, prepare the rest of the ingredients for the mock tuna salad. This may include finely dicing some celery, red onion, and pickles, and chopping some fresh parsley and/or dill. If you prefer a few other ingredients such as finely chopped bell peppers or grated carrot, feel free to add them. 3. Processing the seeds and nuts: Transfer the soaked and rinsed sunflower seeds and almonds into a food processor. Pulse the mixture until the seeds and nuts are broken down into a coarse, crumbly texture. Be careful not to overprocess the mixture, as you still want it to have some substance and a similar texture to traditional tuna salad. 4. Mixing the base: In a large mixing bowl, combine the processed sunflower seeds and almonds with the prepared vegetables (celery, onion, pickles, and any additional ingredients). Mix well to blend all the ingredients and create the foundation for the mock tuna salad. 5. Adding the dressing: In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together some vegan mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, and apple cider vinegar. Season with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder (optional) to taste. Add any additional herbs or spices you like, such as onion powder, cayenne pepper, or paprika, based on your preferences. 6. Combining the salad: Pour the dressing over the sunflower seed and almond mixture in the large mixing bowl. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly coated in the dressing, adjusting seasoning if necessary. 7. Chilling the mock tuna salad: For the best flavor and consistency, cover the completed mock tuna salad and place it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This will allow the flavors to meld and create a more desirable taste experience. 8. Serving the vegan mock tuna salad: After chilling, give the salad a quick stir and taste to see if any additional seasoning is needed. Serve the vegan mock tuna salad on its own, in sandwiches, on top of a salad, stuffed into tomatoes, or wrapped in lettuce leaves. Enjoy your delicious and wholesome vegan mock tuna salad! And that's how you make a vegan mock tuna salad. With its base of sunflower seeds and almonds, this recipe provides a healthy and tasty alternative to traditional tuna salad while still delivering a familiar texture and flavor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Your mother cut you out of the will.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the initial premise, \\"In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"Your mother cut you out of the will\\" is true without additional information. While it is possible that your mother may have removed you from the will as a result of the quarrel, there are other potential reasons and considerations. Let's break down the statement and analyze it further to provide a more comprehensive explanation. 1. \\"In consequence of that quarrel\\": This indicates that there was an argument or disagreement which has led to certain consequences, one of which is your mother making a new will. However, it isn't explicitly stated who was involved in the quarrel, whether it was between you and your mother, your mother and someone else, or even a disagreement between several family members. 2. \\"Your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will\\": This part suggests that your mother made a quick decision to create a new will. However, the motivations behind her decision are not entirely clear, and there could be many other possible reasons for her actions beyond potentially cutting you out of the will. Possible scenarios include: A) Your mother decided to revise her will to include new beneficiaries, such as grandchildren, close friends, or charitable organizations that she had not previously considered. This could be due to her connection or contribution to her community that has been deepened or developed since the quarrel, for example. B) Your mother decided to change the distribution of assets among the existing beneficiaries, which could involve increasing or decreasing the shares. This could be a result of reconsidering her relationship with each beneficiary or her awareness of their individual needs. C) The quarrel led to your mother recognizing that her existing will is outdated or lacking in some way, and she feels an urgent need to rectify that. Perhaps there are unforeseen problems with her current will that, if left unresolved, could lead to conflict or unfair distribution among the beneficiaries. D) Your mother was involved in a quarrel with someone other than you, such as another family member, which led to her decision to revise the will. In this case, it is possible that the changes to the will do not affect you directly and that the hypothesis is not true. While it is possible that the quarrel led your mother to cut you out of the will, there is not enough evidence in the given premise to support this hypothesis exclusively. Further information about the quarrel and your mother's intentions and relationship dynamics would be necessary to determine whether or not the hypothesis is accurate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions.

It is in the Levern Valley, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Barrhead, 3.8 miles (6.1 km) south of Paisley, and 5.7 miles (9.2 km) south-southwest of Renfrew, at the southwestern fringe of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5,000 people. Neilston is mentioned in documents from the 12th century, when the feudal lord Robert de Croc, endowed a chapel to Paisley Abbey to the North. Neilston Parish Church—a Category B listed building—is said to be on the site of this original chapel and has been at the centre of the community since 1163. Little remains of the original structure. Before industrialisation, Neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-storey houses, many of them thatched. Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax. The urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale textile processing was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several cotton mills. Neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a spinning and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former milling village, agriculture has played, and continues to play, an economic role. The annual Neilston Agricultural Show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest Scotland each spring.Although heavy industry died out in the latter half of the 20th century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Neilston has continued to grow as a commuter village, supported by its position between Paisley and Glasgow, from roughly 1,000... contains an answer for the question: What major even brought urbanisation to the town that was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-story houses?, what is it ?

In an opening scene before the credits, an assassin, Banat, is seen preparing a gun while a gramophone skips as it plays. The story that follows is the narrative of a letter from Howard Graham, an American armaments engineer, to his wife Stephanie. While journeying to the Soviet port of Batumi to return to the United States to complete his business with the Turkish Navy, Graham and his wife stop in Istanbul and are met by Kopeikin, a Turkish employee of Graham's company, who under the pretense of discussing business, takes Graham to a nightclub to introduce him to dancer Josette Maretl and her partner Gogo. Banat tries unsuccessfully to kill Graham during a magic act, shooting the magician instead. Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning, where Colonel Haki blames the assassination attempt on German agents seeking to delay the re-arming of Turkish ships. The colonel shows Graham a photograph of Banat, who he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller. Haki then orders Graham to travel secretly to Batumi aboard a tramp steamer, while Haki personally oversees the safe overland transit of Stephanie.  Graham's fellow passengers include Josette and Gogo; Kuvetli, an ingratiating Turkish tobacco salesman; Professor Haller, an apolitical German archeologist; and the henpecked Matthews and his French wife. Josette sees that Graham is frightened, and not knowing that he is married, tries to become close to him. At an interim port call, Graham is made aware of the arrival of a new passenger by the annoying clamor of a gramophone, while Haller warns him that Kuvetli is not who he claims to be. At dinner Graham recognizes Banat and tries to persuade the ship's captain and purser to put him ashore, but they believe that he is crazy.

As the [Your Position] at [Your Company], my objective is to ensure that our company operates efficiently and complies with all relevant regulations and industry standards. In line with this goal, I am writing to address the topic of executing broker agreements and outlining the steps we can take in implementing, reviewing, and ensuring compliance with such agreements for the benefit and protection of our organization. An executing broker is a financial institution that engages in the buying and selling of securities on behalf of its clients. These agreements serve as contractual arrangements between our company and the executing brokers, stipulating the terms and conditions of the services provided, compensation structures, and resolving any potential disputes. To achieve the desired level of compliance and risk mitigation, I recommend adopting the following measures: 1. Drafting and reviewing executing broker agreements: To ensure adequate protection of our interests and adherence to applicable regulations, it is crucial to work closely with our legal team to draft comprehensive executing broker agreements. This process involves addressing critical elements such as: - Scope of services: Clearly define the brokerage services to be provided, including the types of securities to be traded, trading platforms to be used, and the responsibilities of each party. - Fees and commissions: Outline the fee structure for the services provided, specifying any commissions, discounts, or other charges that apply. - Confidentiality: Enforce protections to prevent the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive information and ensure compliance with privacy laws. - Termination clauses: Include provisions addressing the grounds and procedures for termination of the agreement, as well as potential penalties and consequences. - Dispute resolution: Establish a framework for addressing and resolving any conflicts that may arise between our company and the executing broker. 2. Due diligence and broker selection: Thoroughly assess the background, experience, and reputation of potential executing brokers to ensure they are competent and qualified. This process may involve obtaining references, reviewing regulatory filings, and evaluating their demonstrated expertise in the type of securities and markets we operate in. 3. Periodic monitoring and reporting: Establish an ongoing monitoring framework to assess the performance of executing brokers against predefined benchmarks and service level agreements (SLAs). This process can include auditing transaction records, tracking failed or delayed orders, and evaluating timeliness and accuracy of reporting. 4. Regular reviews and updates: Conduct regular reviews of executing broker agreements to ensure their continued relevance and compliance with evolving regulations and market conditions. This process should involve collaboration with our legal team and may require amendments or renegotiations of certain terms. 5. Training and awareness: Develop a robust training program to educate relevant staff members on the intricacies of executing broker agreements, applicable regulations, and best practices for managing relationships with such brokers. This process should encourage open communication and sharing of information to mitigate potential risks and optimize efficiency. Implementing these measures will help our organization maintain a high level of compliance and risk mitigation, while maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of our relationship with executing brokers. My team and I are ready to support these initiatives and ensure a comprehensive approach to executing broker agreements. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for clarification or additional information. Thank you for your attention to this essential matter. I look forward to working collaboratively with you to enhance our approach to executing broker agreements and continue driving our company's success.

Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect: lighting, film speed, f-number (aperture size), and shutter speed (exposure time). The equation may be expressed as ratios, or, by taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, by addition, using the APEX system, in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure; this increment is commonly known as a \\"stop\\". The effective f-number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter, the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area. Thus, a lens set to f/1.4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f/2. Therefore, each f-number factor of the square root of two (approximately 1.4) is also a stop, so lenses are typically marked in that progression: f/1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc. Please answer a question about this article.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an input list. A list contains several comma-separated items written within brackets. You need to return the position of all the alphabetical elements in the given list in order. Assume the position of the 1st element to be 1. Return -1 if no alphabetical element is in the list. Problem:['Z', 'm', 'f', '499', 'd', 'J', 'p', 'm', '2071', 'p', 'z', '2869', '1655', '3607', '8365', '8729', '2127', '8613', 'O', '4703', '5897', 'C', 'q', '4447'] Solution:","output":"To solve this problem, we will iterate through the input list and check if an element is an alphabetical character or not. If it is, we will store its position in a new list. Finally, we will return the list of positions or return -1 if the list is empty. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this: 1. Initialize an empty list to store the positions of alphabetical elements. Let's call it \`alpha_positions\`. 2. Loop through the \`input_list\` using a for loop and enumerate function. The enumerate function will provide both the index and the element of \`input_list\` as we iterate through it. 3. Inside the for loop, check if the element is an alphabetical character using the isalpha() method. If it is, append the index+1 (as we're considering 1-based index) to the \`alpha_positions\` list. 4. After the for loop, check if the \`alpha_positions\` list is empty or not. If it's empty, return -1; otherwise, return the \`alpha_positions\` list. Here's the sample Python code to implement the above approach: \`\`\`python def find_alpha_positions(input_list):     alpha_positions = []     for index, element in enumerate(input_list):         if element.isalpha():             alpha_positions.append(index + 1)     return -1 if not alpha_positions else alpha_positions input_list = ['Z', 'm', 'f', '499', 'd', 'J', 'p', 'm', '2071', 'p', 'z', '2869', '1655', '3607', '8365', '8729', '2127', '8613', 'O', '4703', '5897', 'C', 'q', '4447'] print(find_alpha_positions(input_list)) \`\`\` Solution: The output will be a list of positions of alphabetical elements: \`[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 19, 22, 23, 24]\`. If there were no alphabetical elements in the \`input_list\`, the output would be \`-1\`."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Hellenistic period \\"Hellenistic\\" is a modern word and a 19th-century concept; the idea of a Hellenistic period did not exist in Ancient Greece. Although words related in form or meaning, e.g. Hellenist (Ancient Greek: Ἑλληνιστής, Hellēnistēs), have been attested since ancient times, it was J. G. Droysen in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work Geschichte des Hellenismus, i.e. History of Hellenism, coined the term Hellenistic to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander’s conquest. Following Droysen, Hellenistic and related terms, e.g. Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold, where Hellenism is used in contrast with Hebraism. Q: Who wrote Culture and Anarchy?","output":"Culture and Anarchy was written by Matthew Arnold, an influential British poet and cultural critic of the 19th century.  The Hellenistic period covers the era from 323 BC to 31 BC, beginning with the death of Alexander the Great and ending with the final defeat of Cleopatra and Mark Antony by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. This was a transformative period in the ancient world, characterized by significant changes in culture, politics, and society.  In the realm of culture, the Hellenistic period was marked by a blend of Greek and Eastern influences, often referred to as Hellenization. Many non-Greeks in the eastern Mediterranean and Asia started to adopt Greek language, culture, and customs, resulting in a hybrid civilization. Some of the greatest advancements of this period included the works of historians, philosophers, and scientists. The famous library of Alexandria was also a testament to the intellectual fervor of the Hellenistic era. Key philosophers included Epicurus and Zeno of Citium, who founded the Epicurean and Stoic schools of philosophy respectively.  In terms of politics, the Hellenistic world was characterized by Greek-style city-states (poleis) and monarchies, which were a departure from the previously dominant system of city-states in Classical Greece. These Hellenistic states included the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, the Seleucid Empire in Asia, and the Kingdom of Pergamon in Asia Minor. These monarchies often relied on a blend of Greek and local elites for their administration. Social changes were also significant. With the spread of Hellenistic culture, there was a shift towards a more cosmopolitan society. Social mobility increased, with non-Greeks being able to advance in society by adopting Greek customs. Despite this, there remained significant social and cultural divisions within these societies. The Hellenistic period was an era of significant ferment and change, both in the Greek heartland and in the wider Mediterranean and Near East. Despite its eventual supersession by the Roman Empire, the Hellenistic period left lasting legacies in many areas, including art, architecture, philosophy, science, and the organization of the state. In many ways, it can be seen as a critical bridge between the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome and the later civilizations of the Byzantine Empire and Islam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If uh-huh yeah that was pretty good though really, can we conclude that \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\"? pick from the following. [I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","output":"Based on the provided statement \\"uh-huh yeah that was pretty good though really,\\" it seems that the person speaking had a positive impression of whatever they experienced. When translating this informal statement to \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\", there are several aspects to consider in order to reach a conclusion. 1. Context: Understanding the context of the conversation is crucial in determining whether it accurately reflects the individual's opinion. Knowing what the person is referring to and how the experience or event aligns with their expectations and preferences can provide valuable insights into the level of satisfaction they felt. 2. Level of enthusiasm: The use of informal phrases like \\"uh-huh\\" and \\"yeah\\" could signal that the person is excited or engaged with the subject matter. If they are enthusiastic and genuinely enjoyed the experience, their opinion would align with the statement \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\". 3. The tone of the statement: Since text does not always convey tone effectively, it is important to consider how the individual might have expressed themselves vocally. If their tone was upbeat, positive, or cheerful, then it would be safe to assume that their opinion aligns with the statement provided. However, if the statement was delivered in a sarcastic or indifferent tone, it could indicate a different perception. 4. Clarity in communication: The informal nature of the quote might also be an indicator that the individual was not entirely clear in expressing their opinion. In such cases, it might be prudent to seek further clarification before concluding that their perception aligns with \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\". With all these factors taken into account, it still proves difficult to confidently choose from the given options (yes, it is not possible to tell, or no) without additional context and information. While the initial impression seems positive, its informal nature may obscure the true meaning. Consequently, it may be wise to say [II] it is not possible to tell whether the statement aligns perfectly with the translation \\"I thought it was pretty good!\\" without further information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers.

While the premise and hypothesis do share a common element – the number being an output – the hypothesis adds extra information about the source and time duration of the study that the premise does not mention. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. Based on the comparison in step 2, the premise does not entail the hypothesis since it does not provide enough information to determine if the number is the final output specifically resulting from months of study.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: Does the meeting go pleasantly the whole time? Movie title: I'll Never Heil Again Movie plot: I'll Never Heil Again follows much the same pattern as You Nazty Spy!. It opens at the estate of King Herman the 6 7/8s, the deposed, abeit exiled king of Moronica. Meanwhile, Ixnay, Ohnay and Amscray, the war profiteers from the first film have realized they've made a monster out of Hailstone and his cronies in letting them be too power hungry. They decided that they have had enough of the dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. Herman refuses to accept thier help until he finds out that they were sorry about the whole scenario about wanting to start a war and are willing to pay the price for their actions. To this end, he sends his daughter, the princess Glinda (disguised as Matty Herring in the first film) to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Curly and Larry for a turkey (that is a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey. Larry parodies the attempts to control Greece by saying, \\"I'll wipe out grease.\\") The winner of that battle is a picture of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges. Glinda enters, and starts to place in Moe's mind the idea that his allies, the \\"Axle\\" partners, are plotting against him. After doing this she replaces the 13 ball on Hailstone's pool table with an exploding 13 ball and flees as Hailstone begins a pool game with his partners. Throughout the game the cue ball inexplicably defies the laws of physics avoiding the exploding ball by swerving around it and jumping over it colliding with Herring's head.

Answer:","output":"Based on the movie plot provided, I'll Never Heil Again seems to be a comedic, satirical film that follows the adventures of King Herman and war profiteers Ixnay, Ohnay, and Amscray as they try to retake the throne in Moronica from Dictator Moe Hailstone. The film is a sequel to You Nazty Spy! and continues with a similar storyline that involves various twists, turns, and comedic moments. To answer the question about the meeting going pleasantly the whole time, it seems that there isn't a moment where the meeting is entirely pleasant. The film's climax appears to take place during a meeting between Hailstone and his \\"Axle\\" partners Chizzilini and the Bey of Rum, where Hailstone suspects that they are plotting against him. This is likely the result of Glinda's intervention, as she infiltrates Hailstone's estate and manipulates his thinking. The overall tone of the film seems to be farcical and satirical, with plenty of slapstick humor throughout. As for whether this film is worth investing in, it ultimately depends on your specific interests and preferences, as well as the potential audience for the film. If you are a fan of classic comedies, particularly those featuring the Three Stooges, or you enjoy politically themed satires, then this film may be of interest to you. However, you should also consider the film's potential for commercial success and profitability. Given the historical and political references present within the film, it is essential to retain this context in a contemporary setting. Viewers with a keen understanding and appreciation of history and political satire may find the film more appealing, but a broader audience might not resonate with the content or humor as easily. Before investing in the film proposal, you should consider several important factors, such as the film's production budget, marketing strategy, target demographic, and potential revenue streams (e.g., theatrical release, streaming platforms, DVD/Blu-ray sales, etc.). You may also want to consult with experts in the film industry, like producers, directors, or screenwriters, who can provide further insight and guidance on the project's potential success and return on investment. In conclusion, I'll Never Heil Again seems to be a comedy that mixes political satire, slapstick humor, and a farcical storyline. The film may appeal to certain audiences, particularly those with an appreciation of history and political themes, but its potential commercial success and profitability will depend on a variety of factors, including marketing strategy, budget, target demographic, and more. It is recommended that you carefully weigh these considerations before deciding to invest in the film proposal."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Carson licked my face when he was over last week.

Choose your answer from: (a). erosion. (b). deposition. (c). an earthquake. (d). volcanic activity.","output":"The Grand Canyon is an example of (a) erosion. The Grand Canyon, located in Arizona, United States, is a landmark renowned worldwide for its overwhelming size and incised landscapes. Measuring over 277 miles (446 kilometers) long, up to 18 miles (29 kilometers) wide, and reaches depths over a mile (6,093 feet or 1,857 meters), Grand Canyon provides an excellent exhibition of geological layers and the effects of erosion. Erosion is a geological process where natural elements like wind, water, and ice wear away rocks and soil. Over millions of years, these elements remove and transport surface material slowly, shaping the landscape. The Grand Canyon, particularly, is a prime example of this process, primarily created by the erosive force of the Colorado River. This massive canyon's formation started around 70 million years ago. The Colorado River, along with its tributaries, started to carve its deep channel through layers of rock while the Colorado Plateau was gradually uplifted. Over the years, the relatively fast-flowing river scoured a steep and deep channel, which characterizes the Grand Canyon's shape today. Furthermore, the Colorado River's flow was not only responsible for the canyon's depth, but it also significantly contributed to its breadth. The heavy rains and melting snow would cause the river to overflow its banks, leading to erosion on the sides of the canyon, widening it over time. Apart from the Colorado River, other natural elements like wind and ice also proved to be significant erosive forces that carved the canyon.  The process of erosion also revealed the Grand Canyon's iconic sequential rock layers. The exposed geological strata range in age over 2 billion years, from the Precambrian to the Cenozoic era, making the Grand Canyon a classic site for studying Earth's geological history. Each layer of rock represents a distinct timeframe in Earth's past and offers insights into the changing environmental conditions and life forms of that period. Deposit (b), another geological process, involves the accumulation or laying down of matter by natural processes. While deposition is relevant as it has likely occurred in the Colorado riverbed over time, it does not fundamentally define the Grand Canyon's formation. Earthquake (c) and volcanic activity (d) predominantly relate to tectonic processes, which also have shaped the Earth's landscapes drastically. However, these factors are not primarily responsible for the Grand Canyon's formation and distinctive characteristics. So, to sum it up, erosion, primarily owing to the Colorado River, is the defining geological process that shaped the Grand Canyon. It showcases an incredibly lengthy period of Earth's history, eroded and exposed for us to see today. This makes the Grand Canyon not just a stunning natural phenomenon, but also a valuable resource for geological and environmental studies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The author is providing a balanced review of the experience, highlighting the positive and negative aspects. Here is a breakdown of the sentiment for each part of the sentence: 1. \\"should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times\\" This part has a positive sentiment as it indicates that the experience will have exciting and thrilling moments capable of unexpectedly impacting the audience. 2. \\"give you a few laughs\\" This part also carries a positive sentiment as it suggests the experience will provide moments of humor, making it enjoyable for the audience. 3. \\"leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks\\" Again, a positive sentiment can be perceived from this part.

But because the decision involves two different states and pending appeals, thing get convoluted in the way that only gay-marriage cases can. In today's court hearing, Broward Judge Dale Cohen dissolved the marriage of Heather Brassner and Megan Lade, who were joined in a 2002 civil union in Vermont. Brassner says she hasn't seen Lade for several years and filed for divorce in absentia. But \\"the court needed to recognize the relationship as an out-of-state civil union first, in order to grant it,\\" explains the local New Times. \\"This meant Cohen had to weigh in on Florida's same-sex marriage ban.\\" He did so, declaring the ban unconstitutional in August and then again, because of a legal technicality, on Dec. 8, reports the Miami Herald. The divorce hearing followed today. \\"This is a historic day,\\" says Brassner attorney Nancy Brodzki. \\"This is the first divorce for a same-sex couple. It will not be the last divorce.\\" Brodzki, though, expects Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to appeal. And this is separate from a case on the federal level in which a judge declared the same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional but put a stay in place until Jan. 5. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who handles appeals in this region, will decide before then whether the stay will be extended. Expand this summary.","output":"Sure, sweetie! So let's pretend there are two friends named Heather and Megan. They made a special promise to each other which is really important, just like when Mommy and Daddy promise that they will live together forever. They made this promise in a place called Vermont. Then, Heather couldn't find Megan for a long time, so she decided to break the special promise, just like how some people's mommies and daddies don't live together anymore. There's a slight problem though. They were in Florida, and Florida had a really old rule saying that two mommies or two daddies can't make the special promise to live together. However, Judge Dale, who is like a referee in a game, said that rule is not good and needs to be changed, so that Heather and Megan can break their promise properly.  This was very important and made many people very happy, like their friend Nancy, who helps them talk to the judge. But, there are still some people like Pam, who might not agree with Judge Dale's decision.

It was the first Formula One car to use a carbon fibre composite monocoque, a concept which is now ubiquitous. Can we draw the following conclusion? The McLaren MP4/1 performed equally well during the 3 seasons it was used.","output":"While it is true that the McLaren MP4/1 was used during the 1981, 1982, and 1983 Formula One seasons, it would be inaccurate to conclude that the car performed equally well across those three seasons. It is crucial to consider several factors such as the car's development, the competitiveness of rival teams, the performance of the drivers, and specific technical changes in the regulations. First of all, the McLaren MP4/1 underwent continuous development over the three seasons it competed in, with multiple updates and modifications made to the car. These improvements could have influenced the car's performance from year to year. For instance, the MP4/1B variant was introduced in 1982, and the MP4/1C and MP4/1E variants for the 1983 season, each with different upgrades in aerodynamics, suspension, and engine technology. Secondly, the competitiveness of rival teams should be taken into account. The Formula One landscape is always evolving, with teams making advancements and new competitors arriving. Over the three seasons that the McLaren MP4/1 competed, numerous other teams also made significant improvements to their cars, which could have affected the MP4/1's relative success on track. Some seasons might have been more competitive than others due to these continuous developments by competing teams. In terms of driver performance, multiple drivers piloted the McLaren MP4/1 over those three seasons, including John Watson, Andrea de Cesaris, Niki Lauda, and others. Each driver may have brought his own strengths and weaknesses, altering the car's performance accordingly. It is also worth noting that drivers might experience fluctuations in their performance due to factors such as their physical and mental health, experience, and adaptability to varying racing conditions. Lastly, changes in technical regulations can have a significant impact on a Formula One car's performance. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), which governs the sport, periodically modifies the rules to encourage innovation, enhance safety or level the playing field among teams, among other reasons. Each season may, therefore, have unique challenges and requirements due to these changes, which can directly affect how well the McLaren MP4/1 (or any other car) performed. To summarize, it would be overly simplistic and inaccurate to draw the conclusion that the McLaren MP4/1 performed equally well during the 1981, 1982, and 1983 seasons. Differences in the car's development, competitiveness of rival teams, driver performance, and changes in technical regulations can all have considerable effects on a Formula One car's performance across multiple seasons."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When people got more work? Options: - Before people got fired - They got more work every week - After the transition inside a large company - not enough information A:","output":"After the transition inside a large company"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: RIYADH (Reuters) - Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday there was \\"finite\\" time for talks between Iran and world powers on its disputed nuclear program to bear fruit, but gave no hint how long Washington may be willing to negotiate.      Israel, Iran's arch-enemy and convinced Tehran is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, has grown impatient with the protracted talks and has threatened pre-emptive war against Tehran if it deems diplomacy ultimately futile.      Kerry's sentiment was largely echoed by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, who said that the negotiations cannot be endless like the debates of philosophers over how many angels can fit on the head of a pin.      \\"There is a finite amount of time,\\" Kerry, in the Saudi capital Riyadh on his first overseas trip as the top U.S. diplomat, said of the talks between a group of six world powers and Tehran, Saudi Arabia's main regional adversary.      Kerry was speaking at a news conference with Prince Saud al-Faisal, who suggested Iran was not showing enough seriousness about the discussions, which he said \\"cannot go on forever\\".      Iran was positive last week after talks with the powers in Kazakhstan about its nuclear work ended with an agreement to meet again. But Western officials said it had yet to do anything concrete to allay their concerns about its nuclear aspirations.      The United States, China, France, Russia, Britain and Germany offered modest relief from economic sanctions in return for Iran reining in its most sensitive nuclear activity but made clear that no breakthrough was in the offing quickly.      \\"We can't be like the philosophers who keep talking about how many angels a pinhead can hold,\\" Prince Saud al-Faisal said.      \\"They (the Iranians) have not proved to anybody the urgency in their negotiation,\\" he said. \\"They reach common understanding only on issues that require further negotiation. And so this is what (has) worried us.\\"      The United States and many of its allies suspect Iran may be using its civil nuclear program as a cover to develop atomic weapons, a possibility that Israel, which is regarded as the Middle East's only nuclear power, sees as a mortal threat.      The possibility also deeply disturbs many Arab countries in the Gulf who, some analysts say, could choose to pursue their own nuclear programs if Iran were to acquire an atomic bomb, leading to a destabilizing arms race.      In Vienna on Monday, the U.N. nuclear watchdog raised pressure on Iran to finally address suspicions that it has sought to design an atomic bomb, calling for swift inspector access to a military base where relevant explosives tests are believed to have been carried out.      DIPLOMACY \\"FIRST CHOICE\\"      Iran says its program is solely for peaceful purposes, such as generating electricity and making medical isotopes.      Kerry, in the final stages of a nine-nation, 11-day trip that will also take him to Abu Dhabi and Doha, also had lunch with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the possibility of reviving peace talks with Israel.      Making his first trip abroad as secretary of state, Kerry also met Saudi Crown Prince Salman but a U.S. official said he would not see Saudi King Abdullah, who turns 90 this year.      Kerry said a diplomatic solution on Iran is still preferred by the United States and Saudi Arabia.      In 2008, Riyadh's ambassador to Washington said King Abdullah had repeatedly urged Washington to \\"cut off the head of the snake\\" by striking Iran's nuclear facilities, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks.      \\"We both prefer - and this is important for Iranians to hear and understand - we both prefer diplomacy as the first choice, the preferred choice,\\" Kerry said. \\"But the window for a diplomatic solution simply cannot by definition remain open indefinitely.\\"      Echoing Western concerns about a possible nuclear arms race in the Middle East in the event that Iran obtained a nuclear bomb, Kerry made a series of arguments for Gulf Arab countries not to pursue a military nuclear capability.      These included standing U.S. policy to prevent Iran from acquiring such arms, the dangers of nuclear proliferation, the diversion of resources that could otherwise go to economic development, and the general trend by the United States and Russia toward reducing their doomsday arsenals.      \\"The threat is not just the threat of a nuclear bomb, the threat is also the threat of a dirty bomb or of nuclear material being used by terrorists,\\" said Kerry.      In December 2011, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said that if Tehran did gain nuclear weapons capability, Saudi Arabia should consider matching it.      Riyadh has also announced plans to develop 17 gigawatts of atomic energy by 2032 as it moves to reduce domestic oil consumption, freeing up more crude for export.

Speaking to the IAEA's board of governors, Amano said Iran should grant access \\"without further delay\\" to the Parchin military complex, where the Islamic Republic is believed to have tested rockets.      Since Iran has not provided such access to date, \\"The Agency therefore cannot conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,\\" Amano said.      For about a decade, international observers have accused Iran of secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons program, which Iran consistently denies.      Amano noted that Iran has recently begun installing IR-2m centrifuges at its fuel enrichment plant at Natanz, and that those high-speed devices that rotate to enrich uranium are more advanced than the previously-installed centrifuges.

On Wednesday, diplomats from the so-called P5+1 -- the six-nation diplomatic bloc consisting of the United States, France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia -- held secretive talks with Iranian representatives in Kazakhstan, and then announced future meetings on March 18 and April 5.      The Islamic Republic already faces sanctions from the United Nations Security Council for violating a U.N. resolution forbidding it from enriching uranium.      But Iran says since it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it should be able to enrich uranium for peaceful energy needs.      The IAEA was created in 1957 to promote \\"safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies,\\" its website says. Among its endeavors, the agency tries to verify that countries correctly and completely account for their nuclear material and activities.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that was related to the editor of The Birmingham World?, using the article: A battle-hardened Huntley-Brinkley reporter later said that no military action he had witnessed had ever frightened or disturbed him as much as what he saw in Birmingham. Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had previously worked with the Montgomery Advertiser and was now working for Life magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press.  Moore was a Marine combat photographer who was \\"jarred\\" and \\"sickened\\" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them.  Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life.  The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose. It was titled \\"They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out\\".  A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography.  The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima.  Moore suspected that the film he shot \\"was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a 'good southerner'.\\" Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were \\"making pictures and staying alive\\" and \\"not getting bit by a dog.\\"Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him.  Gadsden had been attending the demonstration as an observer.  He was related to the editor of Birmingham's black newspaper, The Birmingham World, who strongly disapproved of King's leadership in the campaign. Gadsden was arrested for \\"parading without a permit\\", and after witnessing his arrest, Commissioner Connor remarked to the officer, \\"Why didn't you bring a meaner dog; this one is not the vicious one.\\"  Hudson's photo of Gadsden and the dog ran across three columns in the prominent position above the fold on the front page of The New York Times on May 4, 1963., what would be the answer ?

In the heart of this world lies Hyperion City, governed by a ruthless technocrat named Armand Cray. He is obsessed with power and weaves a web of deceit and corruption to maintain his iron grip over the city. Enter Race, the enigmatic and sharp-witted leader of a gang called \\"The Wolves\\", known for their excellent vehicle theft and driving abilities. The Wolves have been a thorn in Armand's side for years, continually undermining his hold over the city by stealing rare and powerful vehicles from his highest-ranking officials. However, when one of their own, Jax, is captured and held by Armand for leverage against The Wolves, the gang must devise a plan to save their friend. To do so, they must pull off their biggest heist yet, infiltrating Armand's heavily guarded mansion and taking his most prized possession - a prototype AI-controlled truck called \\"The Behemoth\\". The Behemoth is rumored to be nearly indestructible and capable of thwarting any pursuit or attack. Race is convinced that stealing this powerful machine will provide them the upper hand in their battle against Armand and help ensure Jax's safe return.

As tension mounts, a series of thrilling car chases and confrontations unfold, as the group is eventually able to steal The Behemoth. Their victory, however, is short-lived when they realize that not only was the truck a trap, but the power within The Behemoth was never real - it's just a myth engineered by Armand to frighten his enemies. Cornered and betrayed, The Wolves join forces with the city's oppressed citizens, who are growing tired of Armand's brutal rule. Using their cunning and unmatched driving abilities, they unite to overthrow Armand, rescue Jax, and bring hope back to Hyperion City.

She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. SimÃ³n claims to see a boy named TomÃ¡s (Ãscar Casas). He befriends TomÃ¡s and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla) informs Laura that SimÃ³n's adoption file indicates that SimÃ³n is HIV positive. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. She later finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, SimÃ³n teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to SimÃ³n's adoption file. SimÃ³n becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon. During a party at the orphanage, Laura and SimÃ³n argue, and SimÃ³n hides from her. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. Escaping, she finds that SimÃ³n is missing and she is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes. Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted SimÃ³n. Six months later, SimÃ³n is still missing. Searching in a Spanish city, Laura spots Benigna who is then struck and killed by a car. The police find evidence that Benigna once worked at the orphanage, and that she had a son named TomÃ¡s who was interned there. The children stole a mask that TomÃ¡s wore to conceal his deformed face. Embarrassed, TomÃ¡s hid in a local sea cave and was subsequently drowned. His death occurred weeks after Laura was adopted. Laura asks for the assistance of a medium named Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin) in the search for SimÃ³n. Aurora conducts a seance during which she claims to see the ghosts of the orphans crying for...

The context provided emphasizes the importance of citing the author's last name in the MLA (Modern Language Association) style, which is a widely-used citation format in academia. This citation method integrates source information within the text through parenthetical citations and directs readers to more detailed entries in the Works Cited page placed at the end of the paper. There are various aspects that support the hypothesis that MLA style identifies the sources used for a paper: 1. In-text citations: This fundamental feature of MLA style allows authors to incorporate brief citations within their text, usually by citing the author's last name and the page number (if available) where the information was found. This practice ensures that readers can quickly locate and cross-reference the cited sources while reading through the paper. 2. Works Cited page: The comprehensive list of sources used in a paper, formatted according to MLA guidelines, offers readers a detailed view of the materials an author has consulted and integrated into their research. The clear organization of this page, which includes features like alphabetical ordering and defined formatting rules for various types of sources (books, articles, websites, etc.), facilitates easy identification and accessibility to the original sources. 3. Academic integrity: By consistently using a standardized citation format like MLA, authors maintain a high level of academic integrity, preventing any instances of unintentional plagiarism or misattribution of ideas. The adherence to these guidelines demonstrates an author's careful consideration and respect for the work of others, which is a fundamental principle of academia. 4. Consistency: MLA style offers a structured and systematic approach to citing sources, leading to consistency within and between different papers. This uniformity makes it easier for readers to understand and navigate through the cited materials, improving the overall legibility and accessibility of academic texts. In conclusion, the hypothesis that MLA citation style identifies the sources used for a paper is evident and supported by the context provided.

Jess Rowles, 24, was left needing stitches to her lip and chin after allegedly being punched in the face by a taxi driver following a night out in Bristol on July 27. These photos show the horrific injuries a woman suffered after being punched in the face by a rogue taxi driver following a night out. Jess Rowles, 24, said she was assaulted by the taxi driver in an 'isolated' street after she told him she didn't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home on July 27. She had enjoyed several drinks with a friend in Bristol city centre prior to the incident and was on her way home at about 2.30am when the taxi driver allegedly locked the doors before driving to the random street. The insurance company worker said she realised during the drive home she didn't have enough money and asked the taxi driver to stop off at a cash point. However, he ended up dropping the two young women off in the secluded street – miles from home – before allegedly assaulting Miss Rowles. She said: 'We had £14 but he wanted £20 so we asked him to take us to a cash point. 'He refused, locked us in the cab and said he was going to take us back to where he collected us. 'But in fact he dumped us in (another road) which was dark, but to be honest we were just glad to be able to get out the cab. 'Then as we walked away he got something out the boot of his car and sprayed us with water. 'I went back to ask him why he had done that and it felt like he punched me in the face. 'There was certainly a lot of force because it knocked me to the ground and I hit my face on the kerb.' The young women, from Shirehampton, Bristol, called the emergency services and police officers took Miss Rowles to hospital where she had several stitches to her lip and chin. However, the cabbie - which the girls believe was run by Bristol City Council and had an Asian driver who was in his 20s– drove off and police have been unable to track it down. Miss Rowles said she told the taxi driver she didn't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home in Shirehampton, Bristol, and asked to be driven to a cash point. It was then he apparently punched her in the face. Avon and Somerset Police were informed of the incident but have now closed the investigation due to lack of evidence, infuriating Miss Rowles, who thinks they have done the 'bare minimum'. A force spokesman said: 'A thorough and detailed investigation was carried out based on the limited information and evidence available. 'CCTV was checked but there was no film showing the incident or a good shot of the actual taxi. 'House-to-house investigations were also carried out and private CCTV checked but no relevant footage was found. 'Because Miss Rowles has a right to complain if she feels we have not carried out a thorough investigation, this has been reported to the force's professional standards department to review.' Ms Rowles has now gained the support of her local MP, Wayne Harvey, who said: 'Seeing the photos of this horrific, violent and cowardly attack on Jess has left me feeling sickened. Avon and Somerset Police has closed an investigation into the case which Miss Rowles blasted them for, saying they had done the 'bare minimum'. She now has the support of MPs who said the attack was 'cowardly' 'This is the second attack that has been brought to my attention regarding taxi drivers becoming violent and assaulting their passengers. 'With all the CCTV we have in Bristol this should be being picked up.' MP Charlotte Leslie added: 'Taxis should be seen as a place of safety for people, not a place where you risk being assaulted. 'It seems sad but perhaps we need to encourage people to note down taxi licence numbers when they get in a taxi.'

Given the question: An apprenticeship is a form of on-the-job training that combines workplace experience and classroom learning. It can last anywhere from one to six years, but four years is typical for most. An apprentice spends most of the time in a workplace environment learning the practical skills of a career from a journeyman--someone who has done the job for many years. The rest of the apprentice's time is spent in a classroom environment learning the theoretical skills the career requires. Being an apprentice is a full-time undertaking. One of the advantages of apprenticeship is that it does not cost apprentices anything. The companies that hire them pay for school. What's more, it offers apprentices an \\"earn while you learn\\" opportunity. They usually start out at half the pay of a journeyman, and the pay increases gradually as they move further along in the job and studies. Near the end of the apprenticeship, their wages are usually 90 percent of what a journeyman would receive. Apprenticeship also pays off for employers. It can offer employers a pool of well-trained workers to draw from.  Despite the advantages, apprentices are usually required to work during the day and attend classes at night, which leaves little time for anything else. Sometimes, they might be laid off if business for the employers is slow. Once they have completed the apprenticeship and become journeymen, they receive a nationally recognized and portable certification and their pay also increases again. Some journeymen continue employment with the companies they apprenticed with; others go onto different companies or become self-employed contractors. What is the tone of the writer in this passage? A) Positive. B) Negative. C) Objective. D) Argumentative. The answer is:","output":"C) Objective.

Since these resolutions were made in the temple, they became, in a sense, religious commitments. Over thirty liquor brewing units voluntarily closed their establishments. Those who did not succumb to social pressure were forced to close their businesses when the youth group smashed their premises. The owners could not complain as their businesses were illegal.  Once 3 drunken villagers were tied to pillars and then flogged, personally by Hazare with his army belt. He justified this punishment by stating that \\"rural India was a harsh society\\", and that  Doesn't a mother administer bitter medicines to a sick child when she knows that the medicine can cure her child? The child may not like the medicine, but the mother does it only because she cares for the child. The alcoholics were punished so that their families would not be destroyed.  Hazare appealed to the government of Maharashtra to pass a law whereby prohibition would come into force in a village if 25% of the women in the village demanded it. In 2009 the state government amended the Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949 to reflect this.  It was decided to ban the sale of tobacco, cigarettes, and beedies (an unfiltered cigarette where the tobacco is rolled in tendu also known as Diospyros melanoxylon leaves instead of paper) in the village. To implement this resolution, the youth group performed a unique \\"Holi\\" ceremony twenty two years ago. The festival of Holi is celebrated as a symbolic burning of evil. The youth group brought all the tobacco, cigarettes, and beedies from the shops in the village and burnt them in a Holi fire. Tobacco, cigarettes, or beedies are no longer sold. Answer this question \\"What does alcohol prohibition have to do with him?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Alcohol prohibition has to do with Hazare because he and the youth group took up the issue of alcoholism to create positive change in the village. They helped close down liquor businesses and made banning alcohol a religious commitment. Hazare even punished some drunk villagers to protect their families. He also appealed to the government to create a law about alcohol prohibition. This shows that Hazare played a significant role in addressing the issue of alcoholism in the village."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and you have to write an answerable question based on the context. Your questions can be extractive, abstractive, or yes-no questions. Q: Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a challenging task due to the variability of the type of errors and the syntactic and semantic dependencies of the errors on the surrounding context. Most of the grammatical error correction systems use classification and rule-based approaches for correcting specific error types. However, these systems use several linguistic cues as features. The standard linguistic analysis tools like part-of-speech (POS) taggers and parsers are often trained on well-formed text and perform poorly on ungrammatical text. This introduces further errors and limits the performance of rule-based and classification approaches to GEC. As a consequence, the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approach to GEC has gained popularity because of its ability to learn text transformations from erroneous text to correct text from error-corrected parallel corpora without any additional linguistic information.  We model our GEC system based on the phrase-based SMT approach. However, traditional phrase-based SMT systems treat words and phrases as discrete entities. We take advantage of continuous space representation by adding two neural network components that have been shown to improve SMT systems BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . To train NNJM, we use the publicly available implementation, Neural Probabilistic Language Model (NPLM) BIBREF14 . The latest version of Moses can incorporate NNJM trained using NPLM as a feature while decoding. Similar to NNGLM, we use the parallel text used for training the translation model in order to train NNJM. We use a source context window size of 5 and a target context window size of 4. We select a source context vocabulary of 16,000 most frequent words from the source side. The target context vocabulary and output vocabulary is set to the 32,000 most frequent words. We use a single hidden layer to speed up training and decoding with an input embedding dimension of 192 and 512 hidden layer nodes.

This means that the Swiss citizens were given the opportunity to vote directly on whether their country should become a full member of the U.N. This decision-making process was not made by political representatives or government elites alone, but involved the entire Swiss population eligible to vote, reflecting the principles of direct democracy in the country. The referendum took place in March 2002, and the Swiss people voted in favor of joining the U.N., with 55% supporting the membership. This marked a significant change in Switzerland's long-standing policy of neutrality and non-membership in major international organizations. Upon the vote, Switzerland officially became the 190th member of the United Nations on September 10, 2002.  The decision to hold a referendum reflects Switzerland's strong tradition of direct democracy, where citizens play an active role in decision-making processes.

Write an article with the title: \\"Can massage reduce anxiety?\\"","output":"Title: Can Massage Reduce Anxiety? Introduction: (Step 1: Introduce the topic, mention the prevalence of anxiety, and the importance of finding effective solutions.) Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health issues worldwide, affecting millions of people each year. As we continue to seek out effective remedies to alleviate the symptoms and enhance well-being, one natural approach that has gained popularity in recent years is massage therapy. This article delves into the question: can massage truly reduce anxiety? The Science behind Massage Therapy: (Step 2: Explain the science behind massage therapy, focusing on the physiological effects.) Massage therapy works primarily by applying pressure, kneading, and manipulating soft tissue and muscle structures within the body. These techniques help to increase blood circulation, relax muscles, and improve lymphatic flow, which in turn may aid in enhancing an individual's overall health. Research on Massage and Anxiety: (Step 3: Summarize a few relevant studies exploring the connection between massage and anxiety reduction.) Several research studies have explored the relationship between massage therapy and anxiety reduction. A meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry indicated that massage therapy shows significant potential for reducing anxiety in various populations, including those with chronic medical conditions or undergoing medical procedures. Furthermore, a study published in the Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology revealed that pregnant women who received massages experienced decreased anxiety, stress, and cortisol levels. These studies, among others, suggest that massage therapy may indeed help alleviate anxiety. How Massage May Combat Anxiety: (Step 4: Describe potential mechanisms through which massage may reduce anxiety.) There are several proposed mechanisms through which massage therapy may reduce anxiety: 1. Increased relaxation: Massage may physically relax tight muscles, leading to an increased sense of overall relaxation, which can mentally decrease anxiety levels. 2. Improved sleep: Massage therapy has been shown to improve sleep quality, and adequate restorative sleep can help minimize anxiety symptoms. 3. Release of endorphins: Massage has been found to stimulate the production of endorphins, which can boost mood and reduce feelings of anxiety. 4. Mindfulness and body awareness: Massage promotes a sense of connection between mind and body, which may help individuals better respond to and manage anxiety triggers. Limitations and Considerations: (Step 5: Acknowledge limitations in the evidence and discuss considerations for those interested in trying massage therapy for anxiety.) It is important to note that the effect of massage on anxiety may vary depending on the individual, the techniques used, and the frequency and duration of sessions. Additionally, more research is needed to establish the long-term benefits of massage therapy in treating anxiety disorders. Nonetheless, given the potential benefits, as well as the non-invasive and relaxing nature of massage therapy, individuals struggling with anxiety may find it a helpful adjunct or alternative to traditional interventions. Conclusion: (Step 6: Summarize the main points and provide a final answer to the question posed in the title.) In conclusion, massage therapy shows promise as an intervention for reducing anxiety. While it should not be considered a standalone treatment, especially in cases of severe anxiety disorders, incorporating massage therapy into a holistic approach to stress management and mental health care may prove to be beneficial for many individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.

One of the most significant aspects of making your writing clear and coherent is by using appropriate transition words that help establish relationships between ideas and logically guide the reader from one point to another. Among the many options available, the word \\"therefore\\" stands out as a powerful tool for showing cause and effect in a way that strengthens sentence flow. This article discusses the importance of using \\"therefore\\" in your writing to optimize sentence flow and clarity. Understanding Cause and Effect: The Role of \\"Therefore\\" Cause and effect relationships are a natural part of any discourse, as they help establish the reasoning behind a particular claim or argument. Essentially, the word \\"therefore\\" is crucial in demonstrating how one statement leads logically to another, creating a coherent and persuasive piece of writing. Step 1: Identify Instances for Cause and Effect Before integrating \\"therefore\\" into your writing, it's important to pinpoint the moments where cause and effect relationships occur. These can be easily identified by examining your text, searching for instances where an idea, fact, or statistic leads to a specific conclusion or outcome. Recognizing these connections allows for a seamless integration of \\"therefore\\" into your sentences and helps improve overall flow. Step 2: Replace Parallel Meaning Transition Words with \\"Therefore\\" For optimal results, replace parallel meaning transition words or phrases, such as \\"for this reason,\\" \\"because of this,\\" and \\"as a result,\\" with \\"therefore.\\" While these alternate phrases can serve a practical purpose, they may also be repetitive or ambiguous at times. In contrast, the word \\"therefore\\" is more concise and precise in establishing a cause and effect relationship. By using \\"therefore\\" consistently, you can reduce redundancy and maintain clarity in your writing. Step 3: Improve Sentence Flow through Integration Once you have identified the instances that require cause and effect transitions and decided to use \\"therefore,\\" it's time to integrate the word into your sentences in a way that enhances flow. Start by rephrasing statements or connecting sentences that contain cause and effect relationships. Placing \\"therefore\\" strategically between the cause and effect will help the reader understand the logical connection between the two, making the sentence much easier to comprehend. Conclusion The word \\"therefore\\" is much more than just a simple transitional tool; it's a powerful instrument that can shape and clarify the arguments and ideas in any piece of writing. Demonstrating cause and effect relationships with \\"therefore\\" not only enhances your writing's clarity but also creates a coherent progression of ideas that guide your readers effortlessly through your work.

Jewish synagogues Congregation Sons of Israel and Chabad Lubavitch of Briarcliff Manor & Ossining are in Chilmark.Saint Mary's Episcopal Church, founded in 1839 by William Creighton as Saint Mary's Church, Beechwood, is Briarcliff Manor's oldest church; it was reincorporated in 1945 as Saint Mary's Church of Scarborough. The granite church was built by local stonemasons and paid for by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including Commodore Matthew Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th-century Gothic St. Mary's parish church in Scarborough, England and the only church with a complete set of William Jay Bolton stained-glass windows.

Its founding is a testament to its long-standing presence in the region, and the stained-glass windows created by William Jay Bolton make it even more unique. The church has undergone a few changes over time, including a reincorporation in 1945 as Saint Mary's Church of Scarborough. The granite structure was constructed in 1851 by local stonemasons, with funding provided by William Creighton's affluent neighbors such as Commodore Matthew Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The design of this church was inspired by the 14th-century Gothic architectural style of the Saint Mary's parish church located in Scarborough, England. The stunning stained-glass windows designed by William Jay Bolton add an exclusive touch to the church, and its near-original condition has helped it become a contributing property to the National Register-listed Scarborough Historic District. Apart from the church's incredible architecture and stained-glass windows, the ivy surrounding the building was brought there by the famous author Washington Irving, who was also a parishioner of the church along with prominent figures such as Commodore Matthew C.

In the first story, Mamie reluctantly agrees to work with a would-be young filmmaker in order to locate the now grown son she secretly gave up for adoption after becoming pregnant from her stepbrother Charley – who is later revealed to be gay – 19 years earlier. In the second story arc, her stepbrother, and his domestic partner, Gil, are deciding whether or not to confront their friends, a lesbian couple (Laura Dern and Sarah Clarke), regarding the paternity of their son. And in the third, a young man, Otis, is involved with a band and trying to keep his father, Frank, from learning that he is gay, while also dealing with the seemingly gold-digging woman, Jude, who inserts herself into their lives., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Who is the gay man that fathered Mamie's son?\\" is Charley, Mamie's stepbrother."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Vastuullisen liiketoiminnan merkitys on noussut viime vuosina entistä tärkeämmäksi tekijäksi niin yritysten kuin yhteiskunnan kannalta. Vastuullisuus tarkoittaa sitä, että liiketoiminnan vaikutuksia ympäristöön ja yhteiskuntaan arvioidaan aktiivisesti sekä niitä pyritään vähentämään tai kompensoimaan. Yritykset voivat asettaa itselleen esimerkiksi ympäristötavoitteita, sosiaalisia tavoitteita ja taloudellisia tavoitteita, jotka ohjaavat toimintaa kohti kestävää kehitystä. Yrityksen vastuullisuus voi kattaa monia eri osa-alueita, kuten energiatehokkuuden, työhyvinvoinnin, yhdenvertaisuuden, eettisen toimintakulttuurin ja paikallisen yhteiskunnan hyvinvointiin panostamisen. Yritysten vastuullisuuden mittaaminen voi olla haasteellista, sillä vastuullisuus voi olla moniulotteista ja eri asiat painottuvat eri yritysten kohdalla eri tavoin. Yksi tapa arvioida yrityksen vastuullisuutta on ISO 26000 -standardi, joka tarjoaa viitekehyksen erilaisten vastuullisuuden osa-alueiden huomioimiseen. Myös yritysten raportointia ja ulkopuolisia arvioitsijoita voidaan käyttää vastuullisuuden mittaamiseen ja vertailuun. Yritysten vastuullisuutta voi edistää monin eri keinoin, esimerkiksi kansallisten ja kansainvälisten lakien ja säädösten avulla, jotka edellyttävät vastuullista toimintaa ja raportointia. Myös kuluttajilla on suuri vaikutusvalta yrityksiin, sillä kuluttajien ostopäätöksillä voidaan ohjata yrityksiä kestävämpiin suuntiin. Kestävää ja vastuullista liiketoimintaa tukevat myös erilaiset verkostot ja järjestöt, kuten YK:n Global Compact -aloite, joka vaalii kymmentä periaatetta vastuullisen yritystoiminnan edistämiseksi. Myös yritysten välisillä kumppanuuksilla voidaan lisätä vastuullisuutta ja kestävää kehitystä. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että yritysten vastuullisuuden tukeminen ja edistäminen edellyttää monenlaisten toimijoiden yhteistyötä sekä yritysten oman sitoutumisen lisäksi myös lainsäädännön, kuluttajien, verkostojen ja järjestöjen toimet. Vastuullinen yritystoiminta on paitsi eettinen valinta, myös avain kestävään tulevaisuuteen ja kilpailukykyyn."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I read this background article the other day: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released.  I am facing a new situation today: Dan visited Twin lakes every year. The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round.

Answer:","output":"Twin I, the lake with colder water, would likely have fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge.

First, let's look at the problem: 269*t + 119*t + 1164 = 97*t We want to find the value of t, which is like a mystery number that we'll find by solving this puzzle. Step 1: Combine the t's on the left side of the equation 269*t + 119*t = (269 + 119) * t = 388*t So now the problem looks like this: 388*t + 1164 = 97*t Step 2: Move all the t's to one side of the equation To do this, let's get rid of 97*t from the right side. We'll subtract 97*t from both sides, like this: 388*t - 97*t + 1164 = 97*t - 97*t This leaves us with: 291*t + 1164 = 0 Step 3: Remove the 1164 from the left side Now, we need to get rid of the 1164 on the left side. We'll do this by subtracting 1164 from both sides: 291*t + 1164 - 1164 = 0 - 1164 This leaves us with: 291*t = -1164 Step 4: Solve for t Finally, we just need to find the value of our mystery number, t. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 291: 291*t / 291 = -1164 / 291 t = -4 So, the value of t that solves this problem is -4!

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. On 25 and 26 April, May and Taylor appeared on the eleventh series of American Idol at the Nokia Theatre, Los Angeles, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show, and the following day performed \\"Somebody to Love\\" with the 'Queen Extravaganza' band. Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert before the festival was cancelled. Queen's final concert with Freddie Mercury was in Knebworth in 1986. Brian May commented, \\"It's a worthy challenge for us, and I'm sure Adam would meet with Freddie's approval.\\" Queen expressed disappointment at the cancellation and released a statement to the effect that they were looking to find another venue. Queen + Adam Lambert played two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012. Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale. A third London date was scheduled for 14 July. On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kiev, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow's Olympic Stadium, and on 7 July 2012 at the Municipal Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland.  On 12 August 2012, Queen performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The performance at London's Olympic Stadium opened with a special remastered video clip of Mercury on stage performing his call and response routine during their 1986 concert at Wembley Stadium. Following this, May performed part of the \\"Brighton Rock\\" solo before being joined by Taylor and solo artist Jessie J for a performance of \\"We Will Rock You\\".  On 20 September 2013, Queen + Adam Lambert performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Queen + Adam Lambert toured North America in Summer 2014 and Australia and New Zealand in August/September 2014. In an interview with Rolling Stone, May and Taylor said that although the tour with Lambert is a limited thing, they are open to him becoming an official member, and cutting new material with him.  In November 2014 Queen released a new album Queen Forever. The album is largely a compilation of previously-released material but features three new Queen tracks featuring vocals from Mercury with backing added by the surviving members of Queen. One new track, \\"There Must Be More To Life Than This\\", is a duet between Mercury and Michael Jackson.  In 2016, the group embarked across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" as a tribute to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day. On 12 September they performed at the Park Hayarkon in Tel-Aviv, Israel for the first time in front of 58,000 people. As part of the Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2017-2018, the band toured North America in the summer of 2017, toured Europe in late 2017, before playing dates in Australia and New Zealand in February and March 2018.","output":"This text is about the British rock band Queen.

Assur-Uballit I Which language is this?","output":"Assur-Uballit I is not a language but rather refers to a historical figure who was an Assyrian king. He reigned from 1365 BC to 1330 BC during the Middle Assyrian Empire period. The name Assur-Uballit derives from Assur, which denotes the Assyrian god Assur, and \\"uballit\\" which means \\"has given life\\" in the ancient Akkadian language. This means that the king's name can be translated as \\"Assur has given life.\\" The Akkadian language was a Semitic language widely spoken in ancient Mesopotamia, which includes present-day Iraq, Syria, and parts of Turkey and Iran. The language's history can be divided into three main periods: Old Akkadian (2500 BC - 1950 BC), Middle Akkadian (1950 BC - 1530 BC), and Neo-Akadian (1530 BC - 612 BC). The last form of Akkadian is also known as Assyrian due to its predominance in the Assyrian Empire. Assur-Uballit I is known for his significant achievements, including expanding Assyria's territories. His reign saw the Assyrians regain autonomy and assert their independence from the Mitanni Kingdom, their previous overlords. Assur-Uballitaire's diplomatic and military successes laid a solid foundation for the growth and eventual dominance of the Assyrian Empire. In addition, Assur-Uballit I initiated a number of building projects which enhanced the infrastructure, particularly in the Assyrian capital of Assur. He was responsible for the construction of numerous temples, palaces, and other monumental buildings, contributing to the city's grandeur and prosperity. In summary, Assur-Uballit I was an important Assyrian king who played a crucial role in the expansion of the Middle Assyrian Empire.

News article: FILE - In this undated file photo released by Xinhua News Agency, a Chinese H-6K bomber patrols the islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The China Daily newspaper reported Saturday, May 19, 2018... (Associated Press)      FILE - In this undated file photo released by Xinhua News Agency, a Chinese H-6K bomber patrols the islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The China Daily newspaper reported Saturday, May 19, 2018... (Associated Press)      BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese air force has landed long-range bombers for the first time at an airport in the South China Sea, a state newspaper said Saturday, in a move likely to further fuel concerns about Beijing's expansive claims over the disputed region.      The China Daily newspaper reported that the People's Liberation Army Air Force conducted takeoff and landing training with the H-6K bomber in the South China Sea.      China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the South China Sea over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.      A statement from the Defense Ministry late Friday said the exercise was conducted on an island reef, but it did not specify when or where, saying only that it took place recently at a \\"southern sea area.\\" It involved several H-6Ks taking off from an air base and making a simulated strike against sea targets before landing, the ministry said.      Wang Mingliang, a military expert, was quoted in the statement as saying that the takeoff and landing exercises will help the air force improve its \\"real combat ability against all kinds of marine security threats.\\"      The U.S. criticized the move.      \\"The United States remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific,\\" a Pentagon spokesman, Marine Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, said in an email. \\"We have seen these same reports and China's continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilize the region.\\"      The Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, using Chinese social media posts, identified the location of the exercise as Woody Island, China's largest base in the Paracel Islands.      With a combat radius of nearly 1,900 nautical miles (3,520 kilometers), the H-6K bomber would put all of Southeast Asia in its range from Woody Island, AMTI said.      Farther south in the Spratly group of islands, China has constructed seven man-made islands and equipped them with runways, hangers, radar and missile stations, further cementing its vast territorial claims in the busy waterway.      The U.S. and others accuse Beijing of militarizing the region to bolster its claims. Adm. Phil Davidson, the new head of the Pacific Command, said recently that China had reached the tipping point in its control over the South China Sea.      China's South China Sea bases can be used to challenge the U.S. presence in the region, \\"and any forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants,\\" Davidson wrote in recent testimony to Congress. ||||| Exercise described by air force as preparation for ‘the battle’ for the disputed waters      China’s air force has landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region, it said in a statement.      Several bombers of various types – including the long-range, nuclear strike-capable H-6K – carried out landing and take off drills at an unidentified island airfield after carrying out simulated strike training on targets at sea, the Chinese airforce said.      “A division of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) recently organised multiple bombers such as the H-6K to conduct take-off and landing training on islands and reefs in the South China Sea in order to improve our ability to ‘reach all territory, conduct strikes at any time and strike in all directions’,” it said.      The statement said the pilot of the H-6K bomber conducted assault training on a designated sea target and then carried out take-offs and landings at an airport in the area, describing the exercise as preparation for “the west Pacific and the battle for the South China Sea”.      China deploys cruise missiles on South China Sea outposts – reports Read more      The notice, published on the PLAAF’s Weibo microblogging account, did not provide the precise location of the exercise.      The US has dispatched warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China’s extensive sovereignty claims in the territory, which is also subject to claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia. The waters are vital global shipping routes and contain what are believed to be significant oil and natural gas deposits.      “The United States remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Christopher Logan said.      “We have seen these same reports and China’s continued militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilise the region.”      Wang Mingliang, a defence expert cited in the Chinese statement, said the takeoff and landing exercises will help the air force “strengthen its combat capability to deal with maritime security threats”.            The move comes weeks after US network CNBC reported that China had installed anti-ship and air-to-air defences on outposts in the Spratly Islands that are also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines, citing sources close to US intelligence.      Washington warned Beijing would face unspecified “consequences” over its militarisation of the South China Sea, and said it had raised the issue with China.      In an analysis published on its website, a US thinktank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the location of the runway was believed to be Woody Island, China’s largest base in the Paracel Islands, which is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.      China has engaged in years of land-reclamation efforts on reefs it controls in the region and built both civilian and military facilities in the contested area.      Chinese military facilities include air bases, radar and communications systems, naval facilities and defensive weaponry including landing strips able to accommodate military planes.

Suddenly, a large crowd approaches, led by a young king named Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone), who wants to make that hill into a mine. Seeing Lamech, Tubal-Cain kills him and takes the serpent's skin, while Noah runs.Many years pass.

The initial equation you have is: -33*a + 3 = -32*a The goal here is to get all the terms including a on one side of the equation and the constant on the other side.  Let's start by adding 33a on both sides to get rid of -33a on the left side of the equation: -33*a   + 33*a  + 3 = -32*a  + 33*a This simplifies to: 3 = a Therefore, in the equation -33*a + 3 = -32*a, a equals to 3.  To confirm this finding, let's substitute a=3 back into the original equation and try to balance both sides: Left side=(-33*a + 3) = -33*3 + 3 = -99 + 3 = -96 Right side= -32*a = -32*3 = -96 Both sides are in balance (-96=-96), so our solution a=3 is correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas.  Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots?  Hint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. A:","output":"Since Ann candied ginger, plums, and pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges, apricots, and bananas, we can determine that she candied plums but not apricots.

During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.  Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws.

Q:The answer to the question: What was the full name of the band member who left the Smashing Pumpkins in 2009? is inside the article: The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

If \\"In a crowded park three racially diverse girls hold hands.\\", does this mean that \\"There are people outside.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"In a crowded park three racially diverse girls hold hands\\" implies that there are people outside.  To further elaborate, let's break down the components of the statement: 1. \\"In a crowded park\\" - This part of the statement sets the scene for the event described, which is happening in an outdoor space, a park, which is also filled with people. Hence, this clearly establishes that the park is an outdoor location where people gather. 2. \\"Three racially diverse girls hold hands\\" - This part of the statement indicates the characters involved in the scene: three girls from different racial backgrounds. By saying that they are holding hands, it depicts an interaction between them that is happening in the park mentioned earlier. This reinforces the idea that there are people involved and that the event is occurring in an outside area. Based on these two components, it can be concluded that the statement \\"In a crowded park, three racially diverse girls hold hands\\" supports the idea that there are people outside. The park setting, the presence of the three girls, and the fact that they are engaging in an activity together (holding hands) all demonstrate that there are people congregating in an outdoor space, hence validating the statement \\"There are people outside.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused.

Arecent research shows that most people would choose the latter. This type of woman is called a nuhanzi (\\"tough woman\\"). Experts believe these characteristics have social and psychological roots among young femalesin China. Su Hao's friends all call her a tough woman, because she can finish tough tasks usually carried out by men. For example, she carries 10-litre water to her dormitory on the 5th floor. \\"I depend on no one but myself,\\" she says. According to a recent survey by China Youth Daily, tough women have become rather common in society. Of the 21,265 respondents, 78.5 percent said they are familiar with a tough woman. About 50 percent said they like women with tough characteristics, while less than 29 percent expressed the opposite view. Why are tough women gaining popularity? Shen Meng, a psychological consultant, believes the fierce competition in society is contributing to this trend. \\"Women are often in a disadvantaged position compared to men,\\" Shen says. \\"In order to survive, they have to be independent, strong and tough.\\" Liu Xiao lin, professor of psychology at Wuhan Mental Health Center, believes tough women are brought up this way. They are often on close relationship with their fathers, who teach their daughters to be brave and decisive,\\" he says. As a result, these women are more likely to be psychologically healthy and more tolerant to stress, according to Liu. Though Liu believes that this is a good trend, Hu Shenzhi, a psychologist at the Guangdong Sunflower Counseling Center, says the popularity of tough woman indicates an unclear line between gender identities, which can lead to relationship problems. \\"Some women with characteristics that differ from the traditional female image may have a difficult time finding Mr Right,\\" he says.\\"Even if they get married, their manly characteristics might cause family conflicts.

News article: Abu Dhabi Lays Off Staff as Gulf Austerity Tightens Thousands of layoffs at state-linked companies in Abu Dhabi are a fresh sign the Gulf’s wealthy oil states are hunkering down for a long period of austerity as low crude prices pressure their economies. Since mid-2015, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries in the region have curbed spending on some construction projects and reduced energy subsidies to limit budget deficits caused by cheap oil. Now some governments are also starting to reduce staff at the companies they control, many of them in the energy industry, in order to ensure the firms are not a drain on state finances if oil prices stay low for several years. Abu Dhabi’s National Oil Co (ADNOC), with around 55,000 staff, has cut hundreds of jobs in the last few months and will have reduced its workforce by at least 5,000 by the end of 2016, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Warner Bros. Theme Park To Open in Abu Dhabi in 2018 The reduction will occur across most of its 17 subsidiaries as part of a restructuring following a reshuffle of the firm’s leadership this month, they said. An ADNOC spokesman did not confirm or deny the cuts but said: “In keeping with the entire oil and gas industry, ADNOC is constantly looking at ways to be more efficient and more profitable, particularly in the current market environment.” The UAE’s oil and gas recruitment market is set for its most difficult year in over a decade in 2016, a report from recruiters Morgan McKinley said. “The oil and gas industry is still feeling the pain, as was to be expected. Overall redundancies have been on the increase,” said Trefor Murphy, managing director for the region. Most layoffs at Abu Dhabi state firms are not in response to production cut-backs; the UAE has not reduced its oil output, and says it is proceeding with long-planned oil and gas development projects. Nor do the layoffs mean Abu Dhabi is running out of money. With hundreds of billions of dollars in its sovereign wealth fund, the emirate could draw down its reserves to sustain current levels of spending for decades. But the government wants to minimize the speed of the draw-down as it looks ahead to the possibility of many years of low oil prices. Last year, Abu Dhabi acted ahead of other Gulf states in cutting domestic fuel and electricity subsidies. Now it is applying the same approach to state-linked firms. In Qatar, state-controlled firms such as Qatar Petroleum and Qatar Rail have been laying off staff. State companies in other states such as Saudi Arabia and Oman have been looking at ways to reduce costs but have so far not resorted to major job cuts. For more on the Gulf region, watch: Most cuts at state firms in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere involve foreign staff rather than locals, because governments want to limit unemployment among their citizens. Nevertheless, the job losses are contributing to an economic slowdown in the region. The International Monetary Fund has predicted Abu Dhabi’s gross domestic product growth will fall to 1.7% this year from 4.4% in 2015. In neighboring Dubai, where the economy is not directly reliant on oil and state-linked firms are vigorously pushing tourism and real estate projects, growth is forecast to accelerate marginally, to 3.7% from 3.6%. Companies cutting staff in Abu Dhabi include Abu Dhabi National Energy Co, which has reduced its workforce by a quarter since 2014. It has cut around a third of oil and gas jobs and 55% of staff at its headquarters, it said this month after reporting a first-quarter loss. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Rail, the federal government-owned entity building a UAE rail network, said it cut 30% of its staff in a restructuring. Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority laid off scores of people, mostly expatriates, sources said. Spokespeople for the authority did not return calls seeking comment. Strikes Bring Shortages in Hundreds of French Petrol Stations National Petroleum Construction Co, owned by Abu Dhabi’s state-owned industrial conglomerate Senaat and one of the largest oilfield contractors in Abu Dhabi, is reviewing its manpower levels, chief executive Aqeel Madhi told Reuters. Construction firm Arabtec, in which Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments is the biggest shareholder, may include job cuts in its cost reduction program, chairman Mohamed al-Rumaithi said last month, adding: “There’s some fat to be taken out.” Some firms are axing expatriates to create jobs for UAE nationals. Medical center operator Cleveland Clinic, owned by Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala, is creating over 100 positions for locals, having told some expatriate staff they have to leave by year-end, sources said. Asked to comment, Cleveland said that as part of its efforts to develop local talent, a number of administrative roles would move to UAE citizens in coming months.

Joel's father, Howard (born Helmuth) Joel, a classical pianist, was born in Germany, to a Jewish family, the son of a merchant and manufacturer, Karl Amson Joel. Howard emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States (via Cuba, as immigration quotas for German Jews prevented direct immigration at the time) to escape the Nazi regime. Influenced by early-rock-and-roll and rhythm-and-blues artists, including groups such as The Beatles, The Drifters and The Four Seasons, he favored tightly-structured pop melodies and down-to-earth, unpretentious songwriting.  After seeing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, Joel decided to pursue a career in music. In an interview he said of the group's impact, \\"That one performance changed my life ... Up to that moment I'd never considered playing rock as a career. And when I saw four guys who didn't look like they'd come out of the Hollywood star mill, who played their own songs and instruments, and especially because you could see this look in John Lennon's face - and he looked like he was always saying: 'F--- you!' - I said: 'I know these guys, I can relate to these guys, I am these guys.' This is what I'm going to do - play in a rock band'.\\"  Joel joined the Echoes, a group that specialized in British Invasion covers. The Echoes began recording in 1965. Joel (then 16) also played piano on several records released through Kama Sutra Productions and on recordings produced by Shadow Morton. Joel played on a demo version of \\"Leader of the Pack\\", which would become a major hit for the Shangri-Las. Joel states that in 1964 he played on a recording of the Shangri-Las' \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\" but he is unaware of whether he played on the demo or master version; The released single included a co-producer credit for Artie Ripp, who later was the first to sign and produce Joel as a solo artist after Michael Lang, who had given Joel a monetary advance, passed Joel along to Ripp to focus his attentions elsewhere instead.  In late 1965, the Echoes changed their name to the Emeralds and then to the Lost Souls. Joel left the band in 1967 to join the Hassles, a Long Island group that had signed with United Artists Records. Over the next year and a half they released four singles and two albums (The Hassles and Hour of the Wolf). All were commercial failures. Joel and drummer Jon Small left the Hassles in 1969 to form the duo Attila, releasing an eponymous debut album in July 1970. The duo disbanded the following October when Joel began an affair with Small's wife, Elizabeth, whom Joel eventually married.

Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she craves companionship from someone her own size. One night, Cornelius, the fairy prince, stumbles upon Thumbelina after hearing her beautiful singing. The two take a ride on Cornelius' bumblebee, and fall in love; during this ride Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by Thumbelina's singing. Cornelius promises to return the next day, but after he's gone, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina from her bed and takes her away. Thumbelina awakens on Mrs. Toad's show boat. Mrs. Toad wants Thumbelina to join their troupe and marry Grundel, who is in love with her.

The whole world felt sorry about the death of Mandela, a great man of history. Mandela is mostly remembered for his efforts to end apartheid  in South Africa. Mandela was born in 1918. In South Africa, there are both black and white people. But at that time, Black people couldn't live or travel where they wanted. They didn't have the right to vote, either. Mandela didn't think that was right. He organized many activities against it, but he was sent to prison for 27 years. Under international pressure, the government set Mandela free in 1990. Great changes in the law began to end apartheid. At that time, Mandela chose to forgive his enemies. He shook hands with the people who wanted him dead. He also encouraged black people to forgive the whites. Because of his forgiveness, Mandela is remembered as a moral model  by the whole world. In1993,Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize. A year later, he became the first black president of South Africa. Both black people and white people voted. Apartheid ended. In 1999, Mandela left office at the highest point of his power.

LIFE AND FLOODING ALONG THE BANKS OF THE LONDON - For centuries, the Thames River, which twists through London as it flows from the mountains in the West toward the sea, was left to the fishing boats and cargo ships that called at the docks along its banks. Now, new life is coming to the river. Last week marked the beginning of debate before the Greater London Council over the Coin Street project - a plan to commercially develop the river's south bank - which is just one of many such fights under way or in prospect. The Thames has become the focus of disparate concerns; among them, the promise of London's commercial development and the daily threat that the river will overflow its banks and leave much of the city under water. ''London has always been uncomfortable in that a great resource, the river, has been ignored,'' said Lance Knoble, assistant editor of the British publication, The Architectural Review, reviewing the relationship of the city to what was once its lifeblood. In central London, he concluded, the Thames is now ''the last frontier.'' Unlike other riverbank cities, such as New York or Washington, London developed in such a way that the Thames separates the wellknown commercial and residential neighborhoods on the north bank from the poorer, more industrial areas on the south. As highways and industrial sites came to occupy the river's edges, Londoners on both banks came to ignore its noncommercial qualities. In the early 1970's, city fathers realized they could no longer overlook one characteristic -the Thames's propensity to o verflow. Spill over it did in 1099, in 1236, in 1663, in 1928 and in 1953. In 1978, the river came wi thin 10 inches of the top of the embankment, calling to mind the floo d three centuries before, depicted by the diarist SamuelPepys as ''th e greatest tide that ever was remembered in England to have been in the river, all Whitehall having been drowned.'' Should it happen today, studies suggest, 1.25 million people and 8 billion in property would be affected. And it can happen, as regularly as low-pressure areas form off North America and move eastward pushing ahead a surge of water - which is often indeed. The chances of flood have actually increased in recent years because the melting of the polar ice cap has raised the level of the sea; because the southeastern part of England has been slipping into the North Sea; and because London itself has been sinking into its clay foundation. When the Thames Runneth Over Thus in 1972, after 35 years of agonizing, the Greater London Council approved construction of a 1 billion system of permanent dams and moveable barriers that, in essence, would shut out the Thames if a surge tide threatened. The estimate is that it will be completed in November 1982. Meanwhile, London has been mesmerized by thoughts of a deluge. Large signs have been erected as ''Warning to those in flood risk area. Sirens will begin wailing about an hour before London is flooded. Don't travel. Go upstairs and stay put.'' A publicity campaign to reinforce this advice is planned by local authorities. And on Oct.27, the day of one of the highest tides of the year, the British Broadcasting Corporation plans to present a television dramatization of a mythical London flood. On the apparent assumption that catastrophe will be forestalled, however, the struggle over developing the river banks grows more intense. In part, it reflects the new availability of abandoned industrial sites in the south; in part, the increased scarcity and skyrocketing prices of land to the north. The Architectural Journal reports that more than 50 development schemes for the Thames are on the table, including plans for apartments, offices, shops, hotels, parks and even two more bridges, although there are already 19. Most proposals involve the south bank. Virtually all await approval from local and national officials. For in Britain, planning controls are so tough as to make New Y ork seem like Housto n. To some, the bureaucratic bog is welcome. A number of schemes are of dubious quality and Londoners need only look at the new National Theater complex, an expanse of concrete far colder than the old industrial buildings surrounding it, to see development gone esthetically sour. A few proposals enjoy favor, such as recycling the soon-to-be-abandoned Billingsgate fish market into a shopping and tourist center, with restaurants, bars, studios, workshops and sports facilities. Developers are already revitalizing the ''docklands,'' a stretch of decrepit wharves, warehouses, public housing and open space to the east of the inner city that may become the site for thousands of units of moderately priced housing. That the Thames is being incorporated into the majority of development plans is an outgrowth of successful efforts to depollute a waterway so dirty that in Victorian times, women sold nosegays to pedestrians by Westminster Bridge. Though cleanup attempts began as early as 1855, by 1960 pollution had worsened and fish life had vanished, except for an occasional eel. A major antipollution project was started in the mid-1960's, but not until five years ago was all waste dumped into the Thames fully treated. The change has been dramatic. Acknowledging a perpetual murkiness - the result of tidal action stirring riverbed sand - the Thames Water Authority contends the river is ''the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world.'' Smelt, bass, shrimp and salmon are being found in substantial numbers. Swans and shelducks are back. For the first time, as far as anyone knows, a sea horse was discovered. Fishermen can be seen on the shore below Waterloo Bridge, and the river, though salty, is safe for swimming. Buoyed by such success, the authorities believe they can rest on their laurels. ''The intent is not to spend any more money on improving quality,'' a spokesman said recently. The opposite is still true for flood control and redevelopment.

Given the following context:  In 1955 in Portland, Oregon, a businessman finds his wife in bed with another man, and commits a double murder-suicide. His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle. He subsequently picks up a female hitchhiker, who he brings to a local motel in Stanford Bay, and murders her after failing to charm her with his flute-playing. Marion's psychic visions of Paul's murders increase in frequency and intensity, and sh soon witnesses him in person disposing of a body on a rural beach, making her his next target. Marion manages to elude to Paul, but he later discovers where she lives, and infiltrates her home, killing Frank. Struggling to walk, Marion manages to flee her home to an adjacent sawmill, and is pursued by Paul. While chasing Marion, Paul impales a worker with a forklift, and then inadvertently crashes through a barrier, driving the forklift off the pier and into the bay.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person who disposes of a body?

Given the question: Italy had two distinct regions. Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress.  Which region had fewer species inhabiting it? The answer is:","output":"In order to answer the question, we need to analyze the effects of abiotic stress on the number of species inhabiting a given region. Step 1: Understand the concept of abiotic stress. Abiotic stress refers to the negative impact of non-living factors on living organisms in a specific environment. These factors can include temperature, water availability, nutrients, and other physical or chemical factors that may limit the growth and survival of organisms. Step 2: Consider how abiotic stress affects species diversity. Higher levels of abiotic stress can lead to a reduction in species diversity, as the challenging environment may favor only a few well-adapted species to survive and successfully reproduce. Such conditions make it difficult for less adapted species to thrive, resulting in a lower diversity of species in that environment. Step 3: Apply the understanding of abiotic stress to the given question. In the question, we are given that the northern region of Italy has a lot of abiotic stress, while the southern region has almost no abiotic stress. Based on our understanding of the effect of abiotic stress on species diversity, we can infer that regions with more abiotic stress tend to have a lower number of species inhabiting them. Step 4: Conclude the answer. Given this information, we can conclude that the northern region of Italy, where animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, would have fewer species inhabiting it compared to the southern region, where animals experience almost no abiotic stress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

V očiach mu blčal tvrdý hnev. Which language is this?","output":"The language you have inquired about is Slovak. Slovak is an Indo-European language that belongs to the West Slavic languages (together with Czech, Polish, and other lingos). It is the official language of Slovakia, a landlocked country located in Central Europe. In a more expanded context, Slovak is a member of the Slavic language family. The Slavic family of languages is divided into three branches: West, East, and South. The three Western Slavic languages are Polish, Czech, and Slovak. These regionally proximate languages have similar structure and vocabulary due to historical and cultural exchanges over the centuries. Although Slovak is most closely related to Czech, there is a substantial mutual intelligibility with both Czech and Polish. Slovak uses the Latin alphabet with certain modifications to accommodate its phonetic requirements. It is characterized by the use of diacritical marks such as the acute symbol ( ´ ) to denote long vowels and the caron/haček symbol ( ˇ ) to denote a change in the consonant’s pronunciation. As for demographic distribution, Slovak is spoken by approximately 5 million people in Slovakia. Outside of Slovakia, there are Slovak-speaking communities in the United States, Canada, Hungary, Serbia, Ireland, Romania, Poland, Australia, and the Czech Republic, among other countries. Thanks to the shared origins and similarities with other Slavic languages, speakers of Slovak can often communicate quite freely with people who speak other languages from the same family.  Your specific sentence, \\"V očiach mu bličal tvrdý hnev,\\" roughly translates to \\"In his eyes flashed hard anger\\" in English.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs.

Here are possible answers to this question: - soccer game - musle - vein - animals - person  I believe the correct choice is \\"person\\", here's why:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"person\\", and here's a detailed explanation: An operating room typically refers to a medical facility specifically designed and equipped for performing surgical procedures on patients. From the possible answers provided, let's analyze each option to understand why \\"person\\" is the most suitable answer: 1. Soccer game: This choice is unrelated to the context of the question, as a soccer game is a sports event and has nothing to do with an operating room or surgical procedures. 2. Muscle: While it's true that surgeons might operate on a muscle during certain surgical procedures, it doesn't indicate the subject being operated on which is required for this particular question (\\"what were the surgeons operating on?\\"). Therefore, the answer \\"muscle\\" is not specific enough. 3. Vein: Similar to the muscle, a vein is a part of the human circulatory system that surgeons might operate on during specific procedures, but it doesn't provide information about the subject being operated on. So, the answer \\"vein\\" is also not specific enough. 4. Animals: Operating rooms are primarily associated with surgeries in humans, and although there are veterinary surgeries for animals, the question indicates that there is blood everywhere in the operating room, implying that the subject being operated on is bleeding. Human operating rooms are designed for human patients, so \\"animals\\" would not be the most appropriate answer here. 5. Person: This is the most logical and appropriate answer since an operating room's primary purpose is for performing surgical operations on human patients. Blood, a natural component of the human body, is often involved during surgeries and is likely to be present in the operating room. In conclusion, \\"person\\" is the most accurate answer among the given choices, as it accurately reflects the subject being operated on in an operating room during a surgical procedure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Two teams of former Derry City players graced the turf for charity in the final match at the ground in its current guise. Redevelopment and modernisation work gets under way this week at the Lone Moor Road ground. It has been home to Derry City since the club's inception in 1928. The multi-million pound project will include a new stand, changing rooms and a new synthetic playing surface. Among those playing in the ground's swansong was former Northern Ireland international Liam Coyle. The striker, a Derry City fans' favourite, grew up in the shadow of the stadium, following in the footsteps of his father Fay - part of the 1958 Northern Ireland World Cup squad - by playing for his hometown club. \\"There's a lot of great memories here, making my debut and scoring a hat trick, winning the treble under Jim McLaughlin and winning the League under Felix Healy,\\" he told BBC Radio Foyle. \\"But progress has to be made and the ground has to be redeveloped\\". A soccer stadium since the late 19th century, Brandywell was voted among the UK's top ten favourite sports venues in the UK in 2002 by BBC Radio Five Live listeners. The ground has seen title triumphs, cup wins, European glory nights and some of the footballing world's great names cross its white lines. Glamour friendlies brought Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United to the famous old ground - players of the calibre of Ronaldinho, Xavi, Iniesta and Gascoigne, among those to face the challenge of the ground's notorious slope. Benfica, Steaua Bucharest, Gothenborg, Vitesse Arnheim, Paris St. Germain are among the European elite to take on Derry City in European competition. There are darker days in the ground's long history too - in 1972 a  supporters' bus from Ballymena United was burned on a visit to Brandywell. Ultimately that would see the club expelled from the Irish League and forced in the footballing wilderness until their acceptance into the League of Ireland in 1985. It was during that exile that the ground's other tenants - Brandywell is owned by the local council -  helped keep the stadium from ruin. The ground is also home to football's Derry and District and Saturday Morning Leagues while it has housed greyhound racing since the 1930s. A final race meeting due to take place last week fell foul of the weather. A new track at the adjacent Showgrounds will form part of the upgrade. Michael McLaughlin of the Brandywell Greyhound Racing Company is looking ahead to the opening of the modernised facility in 2017. \\"I would like to thank all the people who have supported us over the years and look forward to seeing them again next autumn\\". A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council, owners of the ground, said the first phase of the ground's redevelopment would be completed in 2017. It will include \\"a new 1,100 seater stand, a new pitch, new dog track and substantial improvement works across the stadium and perimeter walls\\". A second phase, dependant on the securing of necessary funding, could further increase capacity to 5,000. Derry City FC are now looking for a new home for the 2017 season while Brandywell is overhauled. In a statement, the club said the redevelopment is a \\"very positive and affirming development for the future of the club\\". \\"The project has been long in its gestation and the club itself and our supporters have, at times, been disappointed. \\"To see the actual works begin in the stadium will help us all to relish the possibilities for the future. \\"We can begin to look forward to having a stadium that properly represents the status and the history of this great club\\". A summary of the above article is?","output":"The final match at the historic Brandywell stadium in Derry took place recently, featuring two teams of former Derry City players.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Curtis Mayfield was born on June 3, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Marion Washington and Kenneth Mayfield, one of five children. Mayfield's father left the family when Curtis was five; his mother (and maternal grandmother) moved the family into several Chicago public housing projects before settling in Cabrini-Green during his teen years. Mayfield attended Wells Community Academy High School before dropping out his sophomore year. His mother taught him piano and, along with his grandmother, encouraged him to enjoy gospel music. Curtis Mayfield was known for introducing social consciousness into African-American music. Having been raised in the Cabrini-Green projects of Chicago, he witnessed many of the tragedies of the urban ghetto first hand, and was quoted saying \\"With everything I saw on the streets as a young black kid, it wasn't hard during the later fifties and sixties for me to write my heartfelt way of how I visualized things, how I thought things ought to be.\\"  Following the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, his group the Impressions produced music that became the soundtrack to a summer of revolution. It is even said that \\"Keep On Pushing\\" became the number one sing along during the Freedom Rides. Black students sang their songs as they marched to jail or protested outside their universities, while King often used \\"Keep On Pushing\\", \\"People Get Ready\\" and \\"We're A Winner\\" because of their ability to motivate and inspire marchers. Mayfield had quickly become a civil rights hero with his ability to inspire hope and courage.  Mayfield was unique in his ability to fuse relevant social commentary with melodies and lyrics that instilled a hopefulness for a better future in his listeners. He wrote and recorded the soundtrack to the 1972 blaxploitation film Super Fly with the help of producer Johnny Pate. The soundtrack for Super Fly is regarded as an all-time great body of work that captured the essence of life in the ghetto while criticizing the tendency of young people to glorify the \\"glamorous\\" lifestyles of drug dealers and pimps, and illuminating the dark realities of drugs, addiction, and exploitation. His work influenced many, and it is said that Mayfield truly introduced a new style of black music.  Mayfield, along with several other soul and funk musicians, spread messages of hope in the face of oppression, pride in being a member of the black race and gave courage to a generation of people who were demanding their human rights, without abandoning the struggle for equality. He has been compared to Martin Luther King, Jr. for making a lasting impact in the civil rights struggle with his inspirational music. By the end of the decade Mayfield was a pioneering voice in the black pride movement, along with James Brown and Sly Stone. Paving the way for a future generation of rebel thinkers, Mayfield paid the price, artistically and commercially, for his politically charged music. Mayfield's \\"Keep On Pushing\\" was actually banned from several radio stations when riots began flaring up in some cities. Regardless of the persistent radio bans and loss of revenue, he continued his quest for equality right until his death. His lyrics on racial injustice, poverty and drugs became the poetry of a generation.  Mayfield was also a descriptive social commentator. As the influx of drugs ravaged through black America in the late 1960s and 1970s his bittersweet descriptions of the ghetto would serve as warnings to the impressionable. \\"Freddie's Dead\\" is a graphic tale of street life, while \\"Pusherman\\" revealed the role of drug dealers in the urban ghettos.

Rather than wallpapering the whole room, apply it to the sofa wall alone. The resulting background will reframe your seating area while adding a splash of color and texture. And, since it provides such a striking contrast, it can help break up the visual monotony of bigger rooms. Keep the design consistent with the palette you’ve picked out for the room, as well as its general energy. A coral and seafoam green chevron pattern will look out of place in a room with elegant Victorian decor, but will be right at home in one done up in colorful 1960s retro. Even if there’s nothing behind it, it will add an air of chic mystery. A simple wood slat screen should be versatile enough for most homes, or you could go with an elaborately painted Chinese style to suit other exotic accessories. Be sure to unfold the screen so it will fit neatly behind the couch, unless you prefer to keep your seating pulled in closer to the center of the room.  Update an uninspired screen with a fresh coat of paint or a DIY distressing job. A changing screen may be just the thing you need to conceal tangles of electronics cords near the wall outlet. For a no-fuss fix to your wall problem, all you need is a few coils of plastic stringer lights and a little imagination. Drive nails or push pins into the wall, then loop the lights around them in whatever configuration you find appealing. Colored lights are the more festive way to go, while white bulbs will be subtle enough to suit just about any space.  Have fun with your stringer lights by twisting them into words or symbols.  Naturally, string lights double as a source of illumination. Their soft glow can be perfect for when you want it dim but not too dark. Board-and-batten is an accenting technique that involves layering thin boards over an existing wall to give it added visual texture. The boards are arranged vertically or horizontally, or at intersecting angles for a latticed look. This unique design style can be a practical answer for those looking for a less conventional way to freshen up a sitting room wall. Board-and-batten is relatively inexpensive and simple to install if you know what you’re doing. If you’re not confident in your ability to tackle the project yourself, call a professional contractor to come in and do it right.

Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   CHAPTER SUMMARY 36.1 Sensory Processes A sensory activation occurs when a physical or chemical stimulus is processed into a neural signal (sensory transduction) by a sensory receptor. Perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain function. Humans have special senses: olfaction, gustation, equilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of somatosensation. Sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons that are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are used to receive information about the environment (internal or external). Each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it detects. For example, neither gustatory receptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. Each sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in space, which is known as that receptor’s receptive field. The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system. All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, enter the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to processing that particular sense.   Q: What is a specific region in space within which a sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli?   Choices:  - deceptive field  - amplify field  - symmetrical field  - receptive field  A:","output":"A specific region in space within which a sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli is known as the receptive field. The receptive field is an area where a sensory neuron is able to detect and react to a specific stimulus, whether it be internal or external. Each sensory receptor is designed to detect a specific type of stimulus, such as light, sound, taste, etc., within its receptive field. This allows our sensory systems to efficiently process and respond to various stimuli in our environment and send the appropriate neural signals to the central nervous system for further processing and interpretation by the brain."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Guidelines: 1. Only one criminal charge needs to be identified. 2. The criminal charge should be provided in Chinese. First, read through the paragraph carefully. Draw on your knowledge of legal vocabulary and understanding of the text to identify the specific charge. As the paragraph is about a criminal case, look for words or phrases that refer to illegal actions or offences. The first line has a potential clue as it involves someone (the defendant, Zhang) refusing to perform an obligation or duty. Then later in the text, the paragraph talks about Zhang also refusing to report his assets. According to Chinese law, these actions could be seen as obstructing the enforcement of a court order. Given the script \\"被告人张1某拒不执行裁定\\" and \\"被告人张1某拒绝报告财产\\", which means \\"the defendant Zhang refuses to execute the verdict\\" and \\"the defendant Zhang refuses to report his properties\\". Given these sentences, the charges could possibly be \\"拒不执行法院判决\\", which translates to \\"refusal to enforce court ruling or verdict.\\" Or it could be \\"拒绝报告财产\\", which translates to \\"refusal to report property.\\" With the constraints of the task, the sufficient answer could either be \\"拒不执行法院判决\\" or \\"拒绝报告财产\\".

I really wanted to give it a higher rating, but for now, I can only give it 2 stars. The content available on this app is decent, offering a diverse range of news stories from multiple categories such as politics, science, technology, and more. However, the app's overall performance is quite underwhelming. It constantly lags and freezes, making it difficult for me to read or even browse through the articles. The user interface is not quite smooth, either, sometimes registering touches inaccurately. This takes away from the content's value and degrades my overall experience. Additionally, though the app is visually appealing, I found the organization of articles to be quite confusing, making it hard for me to find specific stories or topics I'm interested in. The search function is also a bit of a hit or miss; sometimes it delivers the desired results, but more often than not, it shows unrelated news articles or nothing at all. Finally, the push notifications can be somewhat overwhelming. While I appreciate keeping up-to-date with important news, I found the frequency of notifications to be excessive, and there seems to be no way to customize or reduce the number of notifications received. Overall, the NPR News app has potential with its vast content library but falls short due to its poor performance, unintuitive user interface, and problematic search and notification functions. I hope they can invest time and resources into fixing these issues for a more enjoyable user experience. Rating: 2/5 stars"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Explanation: When we say that one sentence is 'entailed' by another, we mean that if the first sentence is true, then the second one must also be true. Here, the first sentence does talk about something being 'near sighted', but it doesn't tell us who or what is near sighted. It's like saying Bob has a ball, without telling us which ball Bob has. So, we can't say for sure if the second sentence is talking about the same thing as the first one - it could be, but it could also be something completely different. That's why we say 'it's not possible to tell'.  The answer is not *yes because the first sentence doesn't directly state or confirm that 'I' am the one being near sighted.  And it is not *no because although the first sentence doesn't directly confirm the second, it also doesn't rule it out - it just doesn't give us enough information to know for sure.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable connective-tissue disorder caused by defects in fibrillar-collagen metabolism. Mutations in the type V collagen genes account for up to 50 percent of cases of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but many other cases are unexplained. We investigated whether the deficiency of the tenascins, extracellular-matrix proteins that are highly expressed in connective tissues, was associated with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. We screened serum samples from 151 patients with the classic, hypermobility, or vascular types of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; 75 patients with psoriasis; 93 patients with rheumatoid arthritis; and 21 healthy persons for the presence of tenascin-X and tenascin-C by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We examined the expression of tenascins and type V collagen in skin by immunohistochemical methods and sequenced the tenascin-X gene. Tenascin-X was present in serum from all normal subjects, all patients with psoriasis, all patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 146 of 151 patients with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Tenascin-X was absent from the serum of the 5 remaining patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, who were unrelated. Tenascin-X deficiency was confirmed in these patients by analysis of skin fibroblasts and by immunostaining of skin. The expression of tenascin-C and type V collagen was normal in these patients. All five of these patients had hypermobile joints, hyperelastic skin, and easy bruising, without atrophic scarring. Tenascin-X mutations were identified in all tenascin-X-deficient patients; one patient had a homozygous tenascin-X gene deletion, one was heterozygous for the deletion, and three others had homozygous truncating point mutations, confirming a causative role for tenascin-X and a recessive pattern of inheritance. Tenascin-X deficiency causes a clinically distinct, recessive form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This finding indicates that factors other than the collagens or collagen-processing enzymes can cause the syndrome and suggests a central role for tenascin-X in maintaining the integrity of collagenous matrix.

Article: People born in winter are more likely to suffer mental health disorders, according to a recent study carried out by researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. Researchers raised baby mice from birth to weaning   in either \\"summer\\" light cycles of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark or \\"winter\\" cycles of 8 hours of light and 16 hours of dark. A third group experienced 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark a day. Then half the winter mice stayed in a winter cycle, while half switched to a summer schedule. The summer mice were similarly _ . The mice raised in equal periods of light and dark were split into three groups, one of which stayed on the 12hour schedule, one of which joined the winter group, and one of which joined the summer group. After 28 days, it turns out the summerborn mice behaved the same whether they stayed on the summer cycle or switched to winter. But among the winterborn mice, those stayed in winter kept their previous schedule, while those that switched to summer stayed active for an extra hour and a half, which indicates that mice born and weaned in a winter light cycle showed dramatic disruptions in their biological clocks. The finding is the first of its kind in mammals, and it could explain why people born in winter are at higher risk for mental health disorders including bipolar depression, schizophrenia and seasonal affective disorder. \\"We know that the biological clock regulates mood in humans,\\"said study researcher McMahon. \\"If the mechanism   similar to the one that we found in mice operates in humans, then it could not only have an effect on a number of behavioral disorders, but also have a more general effect on personality.\\" Question: Who is the appropriate reader of the passage?

Typhoon Haiyan has intensified and accelerated as it moves closer to the country with sustained winds of 225kph (140 mph) and ferocious gusts of 260 kph (162 mph). One of the areas expected to be hit is the province of Bohol which was devastated by an earthquake last month. Incoming: Typhoon Haiyan gather momentum as it moves towards the Philippines. The U.S. Navy believes it is the strongest typhoon so far this year. Preparation: Filipino fishermen haul a wooden boat ashore in in Ormoc city in the island of Leyte as Typhoon Haiyan approaches. Impact: The Typhoon is expected to hit the coast of the Philippines at 9am on Friday morning. Haiyan could further strengthen and pick up speed as it moves over the Pacific Ocean before slamming into the eastern province of Samar early Friday, government forecaster Buddy Javier said. As of 9pm the eye of the typhoon was 338 kilometers (211 miles) southeast of Eastern Samar province's Guiuan township. The storm was moving at 39kph (24mph), up from its earlier speed of 33 kph (20mph). The storm was not expected to directly hit Manila further north. The lowest alert in a four-level typhoon warning system was issued in the flood-prone capital area, meaning it could experience winds of up to 60 kph (37 mph) and rain. The U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii said it was the strongest tropical cyclone in the world this year.

Aquino also assured the public of war-like preparations: three C-130 air force cargo planes and 32 military helicopters and planes on standby, along with 20 navy ships. 'No typhoon can bring Filipinos to their knees if we'll be united,' he said in a televised address. Governors and mayors supervised the evacuation of landslide- and flood-prone communities in several provinces where the typhoon is expected to pass, said Eduardo del Rosario, head of the government's main disaster-response agency. School classes and plane flights were canceled in many areas. Aquino ordered officials to aim for zero casualties, a goal often not met in an archipelago lashed by about 20 tropical storms each year, most of them deadly and destructive. Haiyan is the 24th such storm to hit the Philippines this year. Edgardo Chatto, governor of Bohol island province in the central Philippines, where an earthquake in October killed more than 200 people, said soldiers, police and rescue units were helping displaced residents, including thousands staying in small tents, move to shelters. Bohol is not forecast to receive a direct hit but is expected to be battered by strong winds and rain, government forecaster Jori Loiz said. 'My worst fear is that the eye of this typhoon will hit us. I hope we will be spared,' Chatto told The Associated Press by telephone. One of the areas expected to be hit is the province of Bohol which was devastated by an earthquake last month. Gov. Roger Mercado of landslide-prone Southern Leyte province said more than 6,000 residents had been evacuated to shelters, government and emergency personnel had been put on alert, and relief goods have been packed for distribution. 'All we are doing now is we are praying, praying hard,' he told ABS-CBN News Channel. Mayor Emiliana Villacarillo of Eastern Samar's Dolores township said residents of her town did not want to be evacuated because the weather was fine on. Thursday but 'we forced them and hauled them to evacuation centers.' Haiyan is forecast to barrel through the country's central region Friday and Saturday before blowing toward the South China Sea over the weekend, heading toward Vietnam.

Q:Given the following context:  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig? A:","output":"The full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig is Reinhard Keiser. He was born in 1674 and had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Who Cares? Illustration by Harry Campbell for TIME Though global equities have rallied modestly after a sharp plunge in May and June and companies have announced strong earnings, sentiment about the future remains gloomy. In response to intense concerns about a looming double-dip recession, business leaders have complained to White House officials that government policy is inhibiting job creation and that uncertainty about new regulations is discouraging them from investing their 1.8 trillion in accumulated corporate cash. On the flip side, Democrats in Congress effectively cornered the Republicans to extend unemployment benefits yet again, a direct response to the undeniable fact that the unemployed are facing a severe challenge to find work. What should be most striking about these concerns, however, is how little they matter. A double dip is a period of economic contraction that follows a brief recovery after a recession. It's a useful prop for framing economic and political debates but doesn't describe what's actually happening across the country. The reality is that if you are doing well in this economy, either as a company or an individual, you will continue to do well regardless of a statistical double dip. If you are doing badly, you will continue to struggle whether or not the economic data are improving. (See 10 big recession surprises.) GDP has been expanding since the third quarter of last year, graced by government spending and a steady though diminished level of domestic consumption. But as we all know, that growth  5.6% in the fourth quarter of last year and 2.7% in the first quarter of this year  has been accompanied by high unemployment and little job creation. In short, this has been an economic recovery that has felt like a continued recession. That's because for a significant portion of the population, it is a continued recession. Not only is the real unemployment rate (combining workers who have dropped out of the workforce and the headline numbers, together with workers classified as marginally attached to the workforce) in the midteens, but the amount of hours worked has declined, as have many incomes. If you combine that with the scarcity of consumer credit and the uncertainty about the social safety net, tens of millions of Americans are facing a grave economic future. Particularly for men who lack a college education and were or are in an industry that depends on manual labor (construction and manufacturing above all), this is a perilous time. But for tens of millions of others, there is no recession. For the college-educated, the unemployment rate is 4.4% (for college-educated women, less than that). For them, wages have been rising, since more-skilled workers command higher salaries and industries ranging from technology to health care have been hiring and expanding. Those workers are enjoying  in relative moderation  the fruits of modern society, including owning homes, buying millions of cool gadgets like iPhones and BlackBerrys, taking summer vacations, sending their children to costly but worthy colleges and worrying over their retirement accounts, which means that they have retirement accounts to worry about. (See the best business deals of 2009.) And then there are millions of others who fall on the spectrum in between. Very few of these groupings will be altered by a double-dip recession. If the economy expands by 3% over the next quarters, there is little indication that the millions currently struggling or the many more in limbo will suddenly be less in limbo. Nor is there any reason to suppose that companies will suddenly start hiring again. They have integrated productivity-enhancing technologies, understand the dynamics of inventories and had been trimming workforces for years before the 2008-09 crisis. Better policy from Washington won't change that; nor is worse policy truly the cause of it, though it is a convenient excuse. On the flip side, if the economy contracts a bit, there is no reason to expect fewer iPads will be bought. After all, save for a brief few months at the very end of 2008 and the very beginning of 2009, the economic activity of the haves showed remarkable resilience. While contraction will lead to more negative sentiment, sentiment is already negative and is not a reliable indicator of activity. People can feel bad and spend money  and often do. So the double-dip question is yet another rabbit hole that distracts from the structural realities and challenges that the U.S.  and the rest of the world  faces. The debate speaks to a false belief that our macro statistics tell us something truly meaningful when in fact they are no better than shadows of shadows that offer at best a blurry facsimile. Until we begin to have a discussion about the multiple economies that constitute the U.S., our attitudes and our answers will fail to generate the desired  and shared  outcome of a more secure and prosperous future for all. See TIME's Pictures of the Week. See the Cartoons of the Week. Summary:","output":"Despite global equities rallying after a plunge in May and June, concerns about a double-dip recession remain. Many business leaders express that government policy inhibits job creation and that uncertainty about new regulations discourages investment. However, this article argues that a double-dip recession may not have a significant impact on certain population groups. For the college-educated, unemployment remains low and wages are rising. On the other hand, for a significant portion of the population, especially those without a college education, the situation remains challenging. The article suggests that the focus should shift towards addressing the structural realities faced by the US instead of getting distracted by the double-dip question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which happened first, the defeat of the Teutonic Knights or the Livonian Order inheritance?","output":"Title: The Defeat of the Teutonic Knights vs. The Livonian Order Inheritance: A Historical Analysis Introduction The histories of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order are entwined, marked by their shared journeys through the medieval era and their participation in the Northern Crusades. Both orders emerged as dominant forces in the Baltic region, shaping the religious, political, and social landscapes of the time with lasting consequences. In this article, we will explore the chronological relations between two of the most significant events within these orders' histories – the defeat of the Teutonic Knights and the inheritance of the Livonian Order. To better understand the context of these events, we must first delve into the evolution and background of the two orders. The Teutonic Knights and Livonian Order: A Brief Background The Teutonic Knights, officially known as the Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem, were formed in 1190 during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land. As a Catholic religious-military order, they played a significant role in the ensuing Northern Crusades, fighting alongside secular crusaders and other religious orders like the Livonian Order. Their primary goal was the conversion of pagan populations to Christianity in the Baltic region. Similarly, the Livonian Order, established in 1237, emerged after the merger of two previous religious military orders – the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the Order of Dobrzyń. They maintained a primary focus on the Baltic region, seeking to convert the local populations and exert political influence. The Livonian Order operated under the Teutonic Knights' authority, but functioned independently within its own geographical territories, which included present-day Latvia and Estonia. The Defeat of the Teutonic Knights The downfall of the Teutonic Knights can be traced back to the Battle of Grunwald, also known as the First Battle of Tannenberg, which took place on July 15, 1410. This pivotal battle was fought between the combined forces of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led by King Władysław II Jagiełło and Grand Duke Vytautas the Great, respectively. They faced off against the Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. The battle was a result of ongoing tensions and territorial disputes between the Teutonic Knights and the Polish-Lithuanian alliance. At the Battle of Grunwald, the Teutonic Knights suffered a crushing defeat, with heavy casualties and the death of Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Following the battle, the weakened position of the Teutonic Knights and subsequent pressure from the Polish-Lithuanian forces led to the Treaty of Toruń, signed on February 1, 1411. The treaty forced the order to cede significant territories and make considerable indemnity payments, ultimately causing a decline in their political and military influence in the region. The Livonian Order Inheritance The Livonian Order's inheritance refers to the series of events that led to the eventual dissolution of the order and the incorporation of its territories into other regional powers. This process began in the early 16th century with the onset of the Reformation, which led to the erosion of the Livonian Order's religious authority and support from the Catholic Church. Furthermore, the rise of neighboring powers, such as the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Tsardom of Russia, posed a significant threat to the Livonian Order's territorial integrity. The situation escalated in 1558 when the Livonian War began, lasting from 1558 to 1583, and involving the aforementioned regional powers in a struggle for control over the territories of the Livonian Order. The order was ultimately unable to withstand the pressures of the war, leading to its dissolution in 1561. With its dissolution, the last Master of the Livonian Order, Gotthard Kettler, secularized the order's remaining territories, which became the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a vassal state to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Conclusion It is evident that the defeat of the Teutonic Knights predates the inheritance of the Livonian Order. The former occurred in the early 15th century with the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and the subsequent Treaty of Toruń in 1411, which significantly weakened the Teutonic Knights' power in the Baltic region. Meanwhile, the latter event took place in the middle of the 16th century, with the Livonian War between 1558 and 1583 resulting in the order's dissolution and the incorporation of its territories into other regional powers. Although both events are integral to understanding the history and evolution of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order, it is crucial to acknowledge their distinct chronological positioning and the unique factors that precipitated each event."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mary, a baby girl, suffered from colic, whereas Patricia, also a baby girl, did not, so it was quite difficult to console","output":"Mary during her sleepless nights. Patricia, on the other hand, was a happy, easy-going baby who slept through most nights, leaving her parents fairly well-rested. Mary's parents, Sarah and Tom, had tried every trick in the book to soothe her - swaddling, white noise machines, and even driving around the neighborhood to lull her to sleep. No amount of gentle rocking or warm baths seemed to alleviate her discomfort. They even consulted pediatricians and baby experts, only to be told that the colic would eventually pass with time. Overwhelmed and exhausted, Sarah and Tom sought help from their family and friends, who suggested various home remedies and techniques to alleviate Mary's colic pains. Although some of these suggestions showed momentary relief for Mary, none provided a long-lasting solution. At wit's end, Sarah stumbled upon a local support group for parents with colicky babies. With a glimmer of hope, she decided to join the group in search of a solution to help Mary. At the support group meetings, Sarah met several other parents who shared their own experiences and offered advice on how to cope with the stress of caring for a colicky baby. As weeks went by, Sarah soon became close friends with several parents in the group, particularly Laura, who also had a colicky baby named Emily. Laura was a single mother who had recently moved to the city for a new job. Despite the challenges they faced, the mothers bonded over their shared experiences, the laughter, and the tears, and they began to lean on each other for strength and support. As time went on, Laura and Sarah decided to schedule weekly playdates for their babies, hoping that they could learn from each other, find ways to calm their little ones, and give one another much-needed emotional support. During one of these playdates, at a local community center, Mary and Emily were both fussy with colic. Sarah had noticed a small room designed for babies and toddlers attached to the play area, filled with soft toys, cushions, and dim lighting. Figuring it would be worth a try, she asked the play area attendant if it would be possible for them to spend some time in the room with their babies. Thankfully, the attendant agreed. Once they settled in the dimly-lit room with their babies lying on the soft cushions, Sarah and Laura noticed a child therapist quietly observing them from a corner. The therapist introduced herself as Dr. Karen Rivers and revealed that she specialized in helping families with colicky babies. She offered a few relaxation techniques that the two mothers could try to alleviate the colic pains with minimal intervention. One helpful suggestion from Dr. Rivers was to swaddle both Mary and Emily, placing them upright on their laps while gently stroking their babies' backs in a circular motion. Surprisingly, after a few minutes, the babies started to calm down. This simple, yet effective technique released tension in their tiny muscles, which in turn eased the colic discomfort. Another method recommended by Dr. Rivers was to softly hum a lullaby to help regulate the babies' breathing patterns. Sarah and Laura noticed a significant change in their daughters' crying soon after they implemented this technique. The chest-to-chest contact in the upright position, while humming the lullaby, created a soothing environment that helped them establish a stronger emotional connection with their babies. Over time, these connections fostered a sense of safety and security in both Mary and Emily, leading to fewer episodes of colic and fussiness. Over the next several months, Sarah and Laura continued to see Dr. Rivers while attending support group meetings and playdates with their babies. Their friendship deepened over time as they experienced the joys and challenges of motherhood together. As their babies began to outgrow the colic, Mary and Emily slowly developed into content, curious toddlers who brought untold joy to their dedicated and resilient mothers. The journey had been arduous, but through their shared experiences, Sarah and Laura had found strength in each other and managed to navigate the stormy waters of colic with Mary and Patricia. Their friendship, born from the support group, blossomed into a lifelong bond that would ultimately change the lives of both families in ways they never could have imagined."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: TWIN FALLS • It often takes a lot of work to catch a burglar, but sometimes criminals make it easy for investigators.      A Twin Falls burglary suspect returned to the scene of the crime Saturday looking for keys and a cellphone he dropped during the heist, police say.      Caleb Shay Funke, 22, was arraigned Monday in Twin Falls County Magistrate Court on two charges of burglaries and one charge of grand-theft.      A woman called police about 2:30 p.m. saying she’d arrived home on the 200 block of Sixth Avenue North to find her back door open and her house ransacked, police said. Cupboards were open, books and paper were scattered, a file-cabinet was pried open and an unfamiliar cellphone was left on the bed.      A silver 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt was parked behind the house, where police said they could see cash and jewelry on the passenger seat.      While officers were still at the house investigating, a woman drove up behind the car and dropped Funke off, police said.      Funke told officers he let a friend borrow the car and the keys ended up locked inside, court documents said. He said he had arranged for a locksmith to come unlock the car. As Funke spoke with police, a resident of the burglarized house came out with some keys, saying they didn’t belong to anyone in the house, court documents said.      An officer unlocked and started the car with the keys. Funke said he wasn’t the burglar but knew who was.      His story didn’t add up, so police arrested him. When officers patted him down they found a piece of jewelry in his pocket belonging to the homeowner. Her cellphone was in his car, police said.      Police say Funke is also a suspect in two other Saturday burglaries.      A house on the 500 block of Washington Street North had a window broken out and was left in disarray, court documents said. Footprints found near both the garage and the backdoor matched the slippers Funke was wearing when he was arrested, police said.      Another house was burglarized in the 1000 block of Wirsching Avenue West, police said.      The homeowner’s daughter said she noticed bags of change missing and police found checks and a credit card from the home inside the Cobalt, court documents said.      In an interview with police, Funke admitted to being involved with all three burglaries, court documents said. He said he burglarized the house on Wirsching Avenue and was a lookout for a friend for the Sixth Avenue burglary.      Funke said he accidentally broke the window on Washington Street and was only there because he thought his friends lived there, police said. After climbing into the house he figured his friends must have moved and left without taking anything, court documents said.      Funke’s bond was set at 5,000 and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Sept. 25. ||||| Hello, Im Craig Nabat, President of Ambitious Ideas, Inc., and inventor of FINDIT® -- the most innovative and easy-to-use locating device that attaches via adhesive strip or key ring to any of your commonly lost household items such as car keys, cellular phones, remote controls, electronic organizers, eyeglass cases, purses, and anything you tend to misplace.

Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump has more than 14,000 fans on microblogging site Sina Weibo. There is also a Trump Weibo fan page that is dedicated to \\"everything Trump\\". There is no reliable opinion poll on how Mr Trump's comments are received in China, but state media are watching him with a degree of schadenfreude. A recent Xinhua report said his rise showed \\"the limitations of the 'democracy' that Americans have long boasted about\\". After he won a huge margin in Super Tuesday primaries, state-owned newspaper Global Times ran an English-language piece saying it was \\"solid proof that US voters are tired of Washington politics\\". \\"It is probably on this point that Chinese public finds Trump somewhat more agreeable,\\" wrote Ai Jun. But he added that \\"in the normal run of events, Chinese people should reject an arrogant, hawkish candidate like him out of hand\\". Last week, the newspaper went further, issuing a stern warning that \\"the rise of a racist in the US political arena worries the whole world\\". \\"The US had better watch itself for not being a source of destructive forces against world peace, rather than pointing fingers at other countries for their so-called nationalism and tyranny.\\" They tell me, 'You can't really build a wall, can you?' And I say, 'China, thirteen thousand miles, the Great China Wall, the Wall of China, right? \\" But many on the Chinese internet think that perhaps the media isn't treating Mr Trump fairly. \\"He tore down the hypocritical masks of many Americans,\\" says Weibo user ClairvoyanceCard. \\"Every sentence he said is true, but they are not all pleasant to hear.\\" His down-to-earth attitude when he meets voters certainly appeals to many in a country where politicians are remote and rarely mingle with citizens at rallies. Shanghai-based corporate lawyer Wei Li, who spent 10 years living in the US, tells the BBC that Mr Trump \\"is really speaking for heartland Americans, and he is a rare politician who speaks in plain English\\". Mr Li says American election politics is \\"like a theatre\\" and rational politics will ultimately triumph over rhetoric. \\"Trump's pragmatism, his access to information, his smartness as well as good counsel may translate into good decisions, should he win,\\" he says. Sijia Liu, a veteran radio host and commentator who has millions of daily listeners in Beijing, agrees. \\"Perhaps Trump will be the president who makes politics understandable to ordinary people,\\" Ms Liu says. \\"In America, even though you are the president, you cannot behave recklessly.\\" \\"So I wouldn't worry that Trump might become a bad president.\\" A recent widely circulated article on Chinese messaging network WeChat also provides some insights into the Trump phenomenon. In it, author Wan Weigang claimed he read Mr Trump's book - Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again - and concluded that, among all Republican candidates, his political ideas were actually \\"the mildest\\". In other words, Mr Wan thinks Mr Trump is not as hawkish as he appears to be. \\"Before Obama became president, he wrote a book called The Audacity of Hope, and he used 'change' in his first term and 'hope' in the second to galvanise Americans,\\" he continues. \\"But what kind of change and hope that Obama has brought to Americans? Where is his audacity now? Americans have already been bored of such politicians.\\" I would get China to make [Kim Jong Un] disappear in one form or another very quickly.\\" Even among the Chinese diaspora, who might have been put off by Mr Trump's views on race and immigration, there is some admiration. \\"Many people are having a hard time understanding why Trump is so popular, or have the misconception that people who support him are poorly educated, white and angry males,\\" says Wendy Wang. Ms Wang moved to the US from China at the age of 25 and became a naturalised American citizen three years ago. She holds a PhD degree and is a professor at a private California university. Ms Wang tells the BBC she will \\"definitely\\" vote for Donald Trump as she sees him as \\"the medicine America needs\\". I asked what exactly it is about Mr Trump that appeals to her. Her answer: \\"He's smart, honest, outspoken, and he is also a strongman.\\" She adds: \\"He is the kid who yells that the emperor has no clothes.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"In China, many people see Donald Trump as an inspiration rather than an antagonist. Trump's brand is already well-known in the country, with several companies bearing his name. Although there are no reliable opinion polls on the reception of his comments in China, state media are watching his rise with a degree of schadenfreude; Global Times issued a warning that \\"the rise of a racist in the US political arena worries the whole world\\". However, some Chinese internet users think that media is not treating Trump fairly and appreciate his down-to-earth attitude. Many Chinese people admire Trump for his pragmatism, access to information, and intelligence, which they believe would translate into good decisions if he becomes president."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An inquest held into the circumstances of the fatal crash revealed that the pilot lost his life when his aircraft broke into multiple pieces and plummeted to the ground during a public airshow. The accident has left the aviation community and the pilot's family and friends in shock, while authorities continue to investigate the cause behind the disaster. Inquest Details During the official inquest conducted in Cheshire, it became clear that the unthinkable happened: the small aircraft, which was one of the main attractions at the renowned event, started falling from the sky after disintegrating into multiple pieces mid-air. Evidently, there was no chance for the pilot to regain control or eject from the ill-fated plane. The tragic incident took place in front of a stunned audience who had gathered in great numbers that day to enjoy the exhilarating maneuvers performed by seasoned pilots and their incredible flying machines. Authorities are still uncertain about what caused the aircraft to break apart, and the ongoing investigation will aim to provide answers to this deeply distressing occurrence. In the meantime, the aviation community has been offering its condolences and support to the family and friends of the deceased pilot, while reflecting on the inherent risks of their passion for flying. Eyewitness Accounts Several spectators at the Cheshire event witnessed the horrible scene with their own eyes. Many reported that initially, they could not comprehend what was happening when they saw the small aircraft suddenly disintegrate and begin to fall. As the horrifying reality of the situation settled in, the crowd was left in shock and despair. Emergency services were immediately dispatched to the crash site; however, there was little they could do. The pilot was pronounced dead at the scene - the tragic result of a day meant for celebration and enjoyment. The Pilot Out of respect for the family's request during this sensitive period, the identity of the pilot has not been made public. What is known, however, is that the man was an experienced aviator who was passionate about his profession and had the respect and admiration of his peers. Fellow pilots and the wider aviation community have found it difficult to process the sudden loss of their comrade. Raising Questions and Ensuring Safety While airshows are typically events that showcase the incredible capabilities of aircraft and the skill of the pilots who fly them, accidents like the one in Cheshire serve as a humbling reminder of the risks involved in performing such death-defying maneuvers closer to the ground. This tragic crash has raised concerns about the safety measures in place for these types of events, and it is expected that further scrutiny will be placed on the industry by both authorities and the public in the aftermath of the incident. In Conclusion As the Cheshire airshow community and the pilot's loved ones come to terms with the gravity of the loss, the onus is on the industry to examine and reassess the safety protocols and checks to prevent any such future tragedies. As we pay tribute to the bravery and skill of the pilots who entertained and amazed us, we must also remember that the sky is a domain that demands the utmost respect and caution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bin Laden and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack on America. The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were  Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When  Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How did the tradecraft of each of the 9/11 plotters go to fund the terrorist activities of 9/11?\\" is \\"By funneling business fortunes into terrorist activity\\"?

If \\"A man wearing cutoff shorts, a tank top, and green sneakers sitting in a garden with a beer.\\", does it logically follow that \\"a casually dressed man sits in the garden\\"?","output":"Yes, it does logically follow that \\"a casually dressed man sits in the garden\\" when given the description \\"A man wearing cutoff shorts, a tank top, and green sneakers sitting in a garden with a beer.\\" Let's break down the initial description to understand why: 1. \\"A man wearing cutoff shorts, a tank top, and green sneakers\\": This part of the description talks about the attire of the man, which includes cutoff shorts, a tank top, and green sneakers. All of these clothing items are considered casual wear, indicating that the man is not dressed formally. In general, cutoff shorts and tank tops are relaxing attire typically worn during warm weather for comfort and ease of movement. Sneakers, especially those in bright or unusual colors like green, are also informal footwear. Hence, we can infer that the man is casually dressed. 2. \\"...sitting in a garden...\\": This element of the description informs us that the man is situated within a garden, which is an outdoor area mainly comprising of plants, flowers, and other natural elements. Gardens are often spaces where people go to relax, reflect, enjoy nature, or engage in leisurely activities. Thus, it makes sense that a person would be casually dressed while sitting in a garden. 3. \\"...with a beer.\\": The presence of a beer implies that the man is likely engaged in a leisurely activity, as beer is often consumed during social gatherings, recreational events, or simply to relax and unwind. This additional detail further supports the notion that the man is casually dressed, as it matches the informal setting and activity. Taking all of these factors into account, it becomes clear that the given description indeed supports the conclusion that \\"a casually dressed man sits in the garden.\\" The attire, location, and activity all align with the image of a man dressed informally and engaging in casual, relaxing pursuits within a garden setting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer B: wanted to have play-time might be a potential scenario, but it does not directly answer the question about what Addison might do after adding to their collection. Additionally, the context provided specifies that Addison collects toy frogs, which could mean they simply enjoy collecting and admiring the items rather than playing with them.

Article: Just as some people think that certain numbers are lucky or unlucky, others believe that we can use numbers to understand our personalities, or predict what will happen to us in the future. Numerology is a way of using numbers to describe a person's character, and to make predictions about future life events. Numerologists use the numbers 1-9, 11 and 22 -- also known as the \\"master\\" numbers -- to help a person understand his or her personality, life goals, and destiny. Numerologists consider yourLife Path number to be the most significant because this number describes your character. To find this number, add together all the numbers in your date of birth. For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5). In this case the total is 34, so this person's life path number is 7(3+4). Numerologists believe that people with this number are peaceful and affectionate but can also be very reserved. Your Expression numberdescribes your talents and predicts how you should use these to fulfill your destiny in life. Numerologists assign a number between 1 and 9 to each of the letters in your name. These numbers are then added together in the same way as before to find your Expression number. Numerologists can also do calculations to predict when the most challenging periods of your life will be. Numerologists also believe that the day a person is born is important. Each day of the month has a character description. People born on the fourth are said to be responsible, honest, and stubborn. People born on the fifteenth have very strong attachments to family and home. Those who celebrate their birthday on the thirtieth are artistic, creative, and imaginative, and often make good writers. If we calculate the numerical value of our name and birth date, numerologists believe that we can learn more about our personalities. They also believe that we can predict our destinies, how our lives will progress, and what challenges we may... Question: According to the passage, numerologists believe that   _  .

Options: a ) 20 % , b ) 25 % , c ) 30 % , d ) 35 % , e ) 40 % Solution:","output":"Let's break down the problem and find the solution step-by-step. 1. The merchant marks up the goods by 80%. So, if the cost price (CP) of the goods is 100, the marked price (MP) will be 100 + (80% of 100) = 180. 2. The merchant makes a profit of 35% even after giving a discount. So, the selling price (SP) should be 135 (100 + 35% of 100). 3. Now, we'll find the discount percentage offered by the merchant. To do this, we'll set up an equation: MP - discount = SP 4. Plugging in the values, we get: 180 - discount = 135 5. Solving for the discount, we find that the discount is 45 (180 - 135). 6. Now, we'll calculate the discount percentage using the following formula: (discount / MP) * 100 7. Plugging in the values, we get: (45 / 180) * 100 = 25 % So, the merchant offered a 25% discount on the marked price. Solution: b) 25%"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I never thought I'd sport a bald look, but there I was, standing in front of the bathroom mirror, nervously holding the electric razor. Step 1: Charge the electric razor Before I could continue, I needed to make sure the razor was fully charged. I didn't want it dying halfway through shaving my head. I plugged it in and waited for the charging indicator to show that it was ready. Step 2: Set up the work area Next, I needed to set up the bathroom to minimize the mess that the shaving process would surely create. I placed a large towel on the floor to catch the falling hair, and I also prepared a damp washcloth to clean off any excess hair from my face and neck during the process. Step 3: Choose the right guard setting Since I was going for a complete shave, I selected the lowest guard setting on my electric razor. This would ensure that all the hairs were cut to the same, very short length. Step 4: Start shaving Taking a deep breath to calm my nerves, I turned on the razor and began shaving my head. I started near the sap-entangled hair and slowly worked my way around the entirety of my scalp. I used smooth, steady strokes, being careful to not press too hard and potentially cut my skin.  Step 5: Double-check for missed spots After having gone over my entire head, I thoroughly inspected it in the mirror to make sure I didn't miss any spots. I also asked a friend to take a look at the back of my head, as it was difficult for me to see it on my own. They pointed out a few areas I had missed, and I carefully went over them with the razor. Step 6: Clean up and wash my scalp Once I was satisfied that my head was completely shaved, I turned off the electric razor and carefully brushed away any stray hairs from my face and neck. I then shook out the towel on the bathroom floor, disposing of the hair clippings in the trash. Finally, I cleaned the bathroom sink and floor to remove any remaining hair. Step 7: Take care of my newly shaved scalp I knew that my scalp might be sensitive after the shave, so I gently washed it with a mild shampoo and moisturized it with a hypoallergenic lotion. To protect my head from the sun, I made a mental note to wear a hat or sunscreen whenever I went outside. In the end, the bald look wasn't as bad as I had initially thought. It was certainly a change, but one that I grew to appreciate. I even started to embrace my new look and the freedom it provided – no more worrying about styling my hair or getting sap stuck in it again!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Only a third of UK homes currently have a carbon monoxide alarm, while just one in five people realise the gas can kill, according to a new study. Campaigners are trying to cut the annual toll of deaths and injuries caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, which saw 4,000 Britons treated in hospital last year alone. Experts warned that carbon monoxide poisoning, which killed at least 50 in the UK last year, is often unrecognised because its early symptoms can be easily mistaken for tiredness, flu or food poisoning. Faulty boilers are one of the most common causes of carbon monoxide poisoning. Christine McGourty of Carbon Monoxide - Be Alarmed! said: 'We are urging people to go out and buy an alarm now - but there are also two simple steps we'd like the Government to take. 'Firstly, building regulations should be amended so that new homes come with alarms already installed. Secondly, providing an alarm should be part of a landlord's annual gas safety inspection.' Inhaling carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen, leaving the body's organs and cells starved of oxygen.  It can lead to severe confusion, coma and death. Early symptoms such as nausea, stomach cramps and dizziness are often mistaken for flu or food poisoning. However, carbon monoxide does not cause a high temperature. The gas has no colour, taste or smell the only effective way to detect it is with an audible alarm. Carbon monoxide is produced when fuels such as gas, oil, charcoal, coal and wood do not burn fully. The most common cause of this is when appliances such as a boiler or cooker is installed incorrectly or is poorly maintained. Carbon monoxide can also build up when flues, chimneys or vents are blocked. Alarms are available from many DIY. stores, supermarkets, high street shops or directly from energy. suppliers. They can cost as little as £15 and many retailers will be. offering special discounts in support of the campaign. Research. carried out last month found that 63% of UK homes do not have a carbon. monoxide alarm and 78% of people do not know that the gas can kill. The poll of 2,001 adults was conducted by ICM, on September 26 and 27. Zonera Rehman, an HR advisor from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, said a carbon monoxide leak in her home put her whole family in grave danger, earlier this year... We could have died: Zonera with her husband and two sons. They already had their boiler checked each year but didn't have a carbon monoxide alarm. Mrs Rehman, 30, said: 'It was the school Easter holidays and we had just returned from a week away in Stoke on Trent when my husband and our two boys - Zachariah (4) and Zain (2) first started to feel unwell. 'It had been a really hectic week and we had done a lot of travelling so when we all started to feel  tired, at first we simply put it down to normal fatigue.  But then the tiredness became much more severe - at one stage I could hardly keep my head up I was so drowsy, and my four year old son who is usually full of beans was sleeping all the time. 'My husband, who is really fit and active, was napping in the day, something I had never known him to do. I would never describe us as a ‘couch potato family’, so when things hadn’t changed after four days, we realised that something was up. 'It was my husband who first thought about the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning, and on a hunch he bought an alarm. When we turned it on, the alarm went off immediately and kept going off. 'Despite this, we still didn’t quite believe it as we had no problems with our heating or water. My husband decided to buy another  alarm – one that showed carbon monoxide levels so we could be absolutely sure. 'When this showed really high levels, we immediately called the gas board and a plumber.  The gas man turned off the gas and when the plumber arrived he tested the levels of carbon monoxide in our home. Normal levels are around 10 - our levels were above 200. Life savers: Campaigners have urged more homeowners to install carbon monoxide alarms after it was revealed one in five don't realise it can kill. 'It was a fault with our boiler than had caused the carbon monoxide leak. We did all the right things and got our boiler checked every year, so it just goes to show you can never be sure you are safe unless you have an alarm. 'After we realised what the problem was we evacuated our home and stayed at my mother in laws. After a week, we returned home.  We now have two carbon monoxide alarms, which we test almost every day. 'I feel so lucky that we are all alive. It was unusual for all four of us  to be home together for that amount of time – if it wasn’t the school holidays it is likely we wouldn’t have realised what the problem was in time. 'The doctor told us there was high change we could have all died in our sleep. There is not a day that goes by that I don’t think about what could have happened. 'The fact that  the highest levels of carbon monoxide were found in my oldest son’s bedroom still sends shivers down my spine. The thought that I was so close to losing a child will haunt me forever.' For more information and advice about carbon monoxide alarms visit http://www.co-bealarmed.co.uk/.

Which sister did not have a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly?  Two sisters named Mary and Ann went in for a blood test and found out that Mary had sickle cell anemia. Ann was normal.  Hint: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. Answer:","output":"Ann is the sister who did not have a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. In the provided paragraph, it is mentioned that Mary had sickle cell anemia, which is the disease caused by the incorrect production of hemoglobin. This information implies that Ann, in contrast, had normal blood test results and did not have sickle cell anemia. The hint further explains the inheritance of sickle cell anemia and its relation to red blood cells and hemoglobin. Since Ann was found to be normal, her red blood cells do not have the incorrect hemoglobin, and she does not exhibit the disease that affects her sister Mary."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: What a Scientist Is Like If you were asked to imagine a scientist, what image  would come to your mind? The common idea that most kids from kindergarten through college have of a scientist is a man wearing a white lab coat with messy hair, big glasses, and several glass cups of mysterious color1ful liquids giving off clouds of smoke. As for adults, the majority view scientists as strange people who spend 100 hours a week slaving away in a lonely laboratory. However, the reality is quite different. Recently I've had a chance to take part in a scientific experience far from my laboratory and into Costa Rica. It supports a huge amount of wildlife due to its geographical placement between North and South America. It is home to more than 500,000 species  ,which represents nearly 4% of the total species worldwide! First we worked alongside conservationists to preserve wildlife at a leatherback turtle ( )rescue center. We helped the volunteers preserve turtle populations by removing rubbish from the shoreline to create a safe environment for turtle eggs to come out. After that we stayed at Mount Arenal where we studied seismic activity relating to earthquakes. During our stay at Arenal, we rode over the mountainous areas and took a long walk through the rainforest. After reaching the top, we went down and through waterfalls to the beautiful valley below! On the last day we got a hands-on introduction to rocket science where we learned about new rocket technology that will be used on the international space station. During my Costa Rica experience, I know that being a scientist doesn't mean working in a lab all day and night. A scientist is one who loves learning and getting a better understanding of the world from helping preserve wild-life, learning about earthquakes or inventing rockets. I think that schools should really stress that science is so much more than wearing a lab coat and mixing chemicals. Kids need to be aware of the excitement and adventures science can bring!

As she glances out the passenger side window, she is shocked to see a man staring in at her! Mary turns away and looks back, but the figure is soon gone. However, Mary is shocked again when the same figure appears on the road in front of her, causing her to drive off the road. Collecting herself, Mary gets back on the road, and heads towards Salt Lake City.Mary rooms at a residence, presided over by a woman named Mrs Thomas (Frances Feist). There is another person rooming at the house, a rather slimy warehouse worker named John Linden (Sidney Berger).After putting her things in her new residence, Mary goes off to the church to meet the Minister (Art Ellison). She practices on the organ, but after some time, stops and sits by a window to contemplate. The Minister asks her if she would like to take a ride with him to an appointment. Mary also makes a request that since the appointment is outside of town, if they could drive by the pavilion...

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What song did everyone sing at the enormous party? Title: Yellow Submarine Movie plot: Pepperland is a cheerful, music-loving paradise under the sea, protected by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour. In the last minute before his capture, Pepperland's elderly Lord Mayor sends Old Fred, an aging sailor (whom the mayor calls \\"Young Fred\\"), to get help; he runs to the Yellow Submarine and takes off in it (\\"Yellow Submarine\\"). Old Fred travels to Liverpool (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), where he follows the depressed and aimless Ringo and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his \\"mates\\" John, George, and finally Paul in The Pier, a house-like building on the top of a hill. The five journey back to Pepperland in the yellow submarine. As they start learning to operate the submarine, they sing \\"All Together Now\\", after which they pass through several regions on their way to Pepperland:  Sea of Time â where time flows both forwards and backwards to the tune of \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". At one point, the submarine passes itself as it loops through time. Sea of Science â where they sing \\"Only a Northern Song\\". Just before the song finishes, they pick up a monster. Sea of Monsters â The monster is ejected into a sea inhabited by other weird monsters. Ringo presses the panic button on the submarine, ejecting him from the submarine and into the sea. He is seen riding one of the monsters, who tosses him around, and with the threat of Native American-like creatures, resulting in John...

This option is better for achieving the goal of making the bed look like a bus, as buses typically have black wheels, white or clear windows, and a colored body. Painting the wheel black would give a more realistic appearance of a bus's tire and its contrast with the body color. Windows being white will provide a more accurate representation of actual bus windows which are generally clear but may appear white due to light reflections. The other option, painting the wheels white and windows black, is not as suitable because it reverses the typical colors of the wheels and windows, making it less representative of a real bus.

Given the question: Process: - Solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water - After a rain, water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock - The water percolates beneath the land surface - Some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water - Rainwater absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation - The water combines chemically with the carbon dioxide - A weak carbonic acid solution is formed - This acid slowly dissolves calcite, forms solution cavities, and excavates passageways -   Question: suppose more water reaches a zone already filled with water happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"more effect. When more water reaches a zone already filled with water, the overall volume of water in the system increases. This causes an increase in the amount of water that's in contact with the limestone and other similar rocks, which in turn increases the rate at which the weak carbonic acid solution can form. As a result, the dissolution of calcite and the removal of salt from the water will be more efficient, as there is a greater availability of the acidic solution to perform this process. The increased volume of water also means that there is a larger amount of water for the salt to be carried away, so the overall amount of salt being removed from the water will be accelerated. Thus, the supposed perturbation leads to a more significant effect of salt removal from the water system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. To demonstrate this, let's first analyze the given premise and hypothesis individually. Premise: \\"The woman's feet skidded in the dirt under her boots.\\" This statement presents a situation in which a woman is experiencing a lack of traction or grip with the ground, causing her feet to slide or \\"skid\\" on the surface. This could be due to various reasons, such as the ground being slippery, the boots being unsuitable for the terrain, or an intentional action by the woman. However, the exact reason for the skidding is not given in the premise. Hypothesis: \\"The woman was trying to do the moonwalk through the dirt.\\" Moonwalking is a dance move popularized by Michael Jackson, which gives the illusion of someone walking backward while their feet are gliding on the ground. The hypothesis suggests that the woman may have been trying to achieve this particular dance move in the given situation. Now, to consider if the premise entails the hypothesis: entailment occurs when one proposition necessarily follows from another. In this case, the premise would entail the hypothesis if the woman's feet skidding were solely and directly due to her attempt at doing the moonwalk. However, there are multiple potential explanations for why the woman's feet skidded in the dirt under her boots. Some alternative scenarios include: 1. She could have been walking or running on uneven terrain or slippery ground, which caused her feet to skid unintentionally. 2. She might have been startled or trying to stop suddenly, leading to an unintentional loss of traction. 3. The woman could have been deliberately sliding her feet for reasons unrelated to moonwalking, such as practicing a different dance move, testing her boots' grip, or playing a game. Given these alternative possibilities, it is not necessary that the woman's skidding feet were a direct result of attempting to do the moonwalk. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In conclusion, although the hypothesis is a possible explanation for the premise, it is not the only potential reason for the woman's feet skidding. Thus, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, and the two statements could be related but not causally linked."},{"instruction":"Give me the correct facts to answer this: when did the orioles win the pennant?

This sentence, \\"Don swatted the mosquito with the newspaper,\\" can be considered acceptable linguistically. An linguist would likely examine the grammaticality, syntax, and semantics to evaluate a sentence. 1. Grammaticality: The sentence follows the rules of English grammar. It has a subject (Don), a verb (swatted), and an object (the mosquito). It also utilizes a prepositional phrase (with the newspaper) to provide additional information about the action. All of these elements are properly ordered and conjugated. 2. Syntax: The sentence demonstrates correct syntactic structure. It follows the typical Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, which is common in English sentences. Additionally, the prepositional phrase \\"with the newspaper\\" coveys the instrument used to carry out the action, further adding to the syntactic clarity. 3. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence makes sense. The meaning is clear - It describes a situation where Don performs an action (swatting) on a mosquito, using a newspaper as the tool. The words and phrases used in the sentence are easily understood and follow the conventions of English vocabulary.

Formed in 1994, the band is known for its eclectic genre-crossing style, predominately in the fusion of gangsta rap and punk it has termed \\"G-punk\\", but also for its reggae-fused music. The band's cross-genre mix of styles has been cited by journalists as having a considerable impact on rap rock and nu metal, though no firsthand accounts of the band influencing bands in either genre exists and the band itself has denied being a part of these styles, identifying more as a punk rock band utilizing rap vocals in conjunction with other vocal styles (melodic reggae singing, screaming and death growls) rather than being a rap rock band in of itself. One reviewer described the \\"nu metal\\" categorization as being a mistaken association. Hed PE performs a style of music which they have referred to as \\"G-punk\\", a phrase inspired by the term \\"G-funk\\". Hed PE has also described its music as \\"schizophrenic\\". Hed PE's music is a fusion of styles ranging from hip hop, reggae, and ska to hard rock, punk, and heavy metal. Other elements that have been incorporated into this style include blues, funk, jazz and industrial. Jared Gomes' vocal style ranges from melodic singing to rapping, screaming, and death growls. The band's lyrics draw from a number of subjects, including social justice, the existence of extraterrestrial life, criticism of organized religion, the 9/11 Truth movement, cannabis use and sexual intercourse.  The band has disassociated itself from nu metal and rap rock, with former guitarist Jaxon stating that \\"I wouldn't call our band nu metal\\" and Gomes noting that his vocal style is wider ranging than simply rapping. Regarding the band's association with nu metal, Kik Axe described the band as being \\"mistakenly lumped\\" into the genre, while Beatdust described the band's sound as helping shape nu metal, listing Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit as bands it believes were influenced by Hed PE. Hed PE itself claims that Linkin Park was influenced by Hed PE's music and that Fred Durst listened to Hed PE frequently while recording Limp Bizkit's debut album; these claims, however, have not been backed up by either Durst or Linkin Park.  Gomes, in addition to the 9/11 Truth movement, has expressed support for social liberal politicians such as Nancy Pelosi and president Barack Obama. Previously however, Gomes' 2004 lyrics for Only in Amerika expressed support for nationalism, and called for retaliation against Al Qaeda for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. How does G-Punk fit in with those subjects?","output":"Alright, imagine you have a big bowl of ice cream with all your favorite flavors and toppings mixed together. That's what G-Punk is like for music! It's a special mix of many different types of music, like hip-hop, reggae, punk rock, and more. Just like how you like different flavors of ice cream, this band, Hed PE, likes to mix different music styles in their songs to create a fun and unique sound. Now, when Hed PE makes their music, they love to talk and sing about important things that are happening in the world, like being kind to others, questioning certain ideas, and even things like aliens or using special plants. They also talk about events and people who are leaders in our world. By talking about these subjects, they want to make people think and understand more about what's going on around them. G-Punk is a cool way for Hed PE to share these big ideas with people through their special mix of music styles, even though some people might misunderstand what kind of music they are making."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who Geoffery Bush characterizes as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\"? from the following article ?  Stanford wrote of Bennett: He maintained his British characteristics throughout his life ...The English take a kind of pride in concealing their feelings and emotions, and this is reflected in their folk-song. The Thames has no rapids and no falls; it winds along under its woods in a gentle stream, never dry and never halting; it is the type of the spirit of English folkmusic ... England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley. W. B. Squire wrote in 1885: His sense of form was so strong, and his refined nature so abhorred any mere seeking after effect, that his music sometimes gives the impression of being produced under restraint. He seldom, if ever, gave rein to his unbridled fancy; everything is justly proportioned, clearly defined, and kept within the limits which the conscientiousness of his self-criticism would not let him overstep. It is this which makes him, as has been said, so peculiarly a musician's composer: the broad effects and bold contrasts which an uneducated public admires are absent; it takes an educated audience to appreciate to the full the exquisitely refined and delicate nature of his genius. Temperley suggests that, despite his reverence for Mendelssohn, Bennett took Mozart as his model. Geoffrey Bush agrees that \\"[h]is best work, like his piano playing, was full of passion none the less powerful for being Mozartian (that is to say, perfectly controlled)\\", and characterizes him as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\".

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There are new findings that not enough sleep may cause people to gain weight.Researchers say a lack of sleep can produce hormonal changes that increase feelings of hunger. In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially  for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night.

The answer to the question: Which kingdom had their king baptized in 580? is inside the article: John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The kingdom that had their king baptized in 580, according to the information given in the article, is Alodia.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There are various aspects that go into making a successful school, and success can be measured in various ways. Often, the teachers are praised for a school's success and blamed for its failure. Yet, in order for a school to be effective, it must be a place where teaching and learning can easily take place, and that requires the hard work of more than just educators. Students must take learning into their own hands and feel as if what they are doing is as important as it actually is. This can only be done with the cooperation of every adult that is involved in the students' life. Some of these individuals often go unnoticed, yet the role they play in the students' lives is immeasurable. In the school, administrative assistants greet students at the start of the day and answer a large quantity of questions. When an assistant remembers a student's name or even something special about that student, it communicates to him that he is cared for. The assistant can also give that extra encouragement for a student to make better choices, especially when they are visiting the principal's office. Meanwhile, though cafeteria workers have a short space of time to interact with students, they can make a big difference as well. Beyond meeting nutritional needs, cafeteria workers may also on occasion meet the emotional needs of the students they serve. Students benefit from positive interaction with adults, and cafeteria workers may give that extra bit of encouragement that a child needs. Custodians   are usually underappreciated for what they offer to schools. They have to be knowledgeable about everything from cleaning to fixing the most intricate   tools. They get to school early in the morning before teachers arrive and lock up late at night after the last student has left from the after-school event. They also make sure teachers are equipped with the necessary items and prepare the rooms so that they are ready for learning. A great custodian also gives that kind word or extra smile to that student who needs it most. Options: A It's enough for them to cook for the students. B It's hard for them to interact with the students. C They have the most interaction with students at school. D They can also meet the emotional needs of the students. Answer: D They can also meet the emotional needs of the students. Question: Answer:","output":"Question: What role do cafeteria workers play in contributing to a successful school environment? A.

B. yes.","output":"A. no. The two questions are not the same. The first question is related to a technology concept, asking about a superheterodyne transmitter. To answer this question, a superheterodyne transmitter is an electronic device used in radio communication systems that uses the technique of frequency mixing to convert a high-frequency signal to a lower frequency. This makes the transmission and reception of signals more efficient. The superheterodyne technology is widely used in various forms of radio communications including FM and AM radio, satellite communication, and short-wave broadcasting. The second question is related to medical conditions, specifically cancer and spontaneous remission. Spontaneous remission refers to an unexpected decrease or disappearance of cancer without any specific treatment. After spontaneous remission of cancer, the outcome can vary greatly. It could lead to continued remission, metastasis (spreading of cancer to other parts of the body), or reappearance of the disease. The specific outcome depends on several factors such as the type of cancer, the stage of the disease, and individual patient factors.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What are the most important words in the following sentence: Scissors, material, thread and hoop to do a needlepoint project.","output":"In the given sentence, \\"Scissors, material, thread and hoop to do a needlepoint project,\\" several words can be considered important as they provide key information about the context of the sentence. However, the following four words carry the most significance as they define the tools and materials needed to complete a needlepoint project: 1. Scissors: Scissors are an essential tool for any needlepoint project. They are used for cutting fabric, trimming threads, and other tasks where precision cutting is necessary. A good pair of sharp, high-quality embroidery scissors is essential in ensuring clean cuts and avoiding frayed edges, thus maintaining the quality of the project. 2. Material: The choice of material, or fabric, is vital as it serves as the foundation for the needlepoint project. It determines the appearance, feel, and durability of the finished piece. Common materials used for needlepoint include canvas, linen, and Aida cloth. Each of these materials offers unique attributes such as fiber content, thread count, and weave structure that can impact the overall quality and appearance of the finished project. 3. Thread: Thread choice is a crucial aspect of any needlepoint project, as it determines the colors, textures, and overall visual appeal of the finished piece. Threads come in various materials, thicknesses, and finishes, each offering different results depending on the project's specific requirements. Some common threads used in needlepoint include cotton, silk, wool, and synthetic fibers. Choosing the appropriate thread weight and type is essential so that it complements and enhances the design and the chosen material. 4. Hoop: A hoop is an indispensable tool in needlepoint as it helps maintain the fabric's tension and keeps it secure during the stitching process. The hoop typically consists of two concentric rings, with the needlepoint fabric stretched between them. The hoop helps ensure even, precise, and consistent stitches while keeping the fabric taut and preventing it from wrinkling, which is especially important for needlepoint projects that require intricate details and intricate designs. In conclusion, the words \\"scissors,\\" \\"material,\\" \\"thread,\\" and \\"hoop\\" are the most important words in this sentence, as they represent the key components that are necessary for successfully completing a needlepoint project. Each of these elements contributes to the overall quality, aesthetics, and durability of the finished piece, making them essential considerations for any needlepoint project."},{"instruction":"Information:  - A scavenger hunt is a party game in which the organizers prepare a list defining specific items, which the participants seek to gather or complete all items on the list, usually without purchasing them.

I’ve got no doubts about that. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has told his players 'there are no excuses' after the signing of Jermain Defoe. Defoe is in contention to face former side Tottenham at White Hart Lane on the weekend. Black Cats manager Poyet said he was thrilled to have signed the former Tottenham striker. 11 - Aston Villa. 18 - Sunderland. 19 - Burnley. 20 - West Brom, Hull, Leicester. 22 - Crystal Palace, Stoke. ‘It doesn’t happen that way very often, and it’s not very often we’re in a position where we can bring in a player of the quality of Jermain Defoe. ‘But we’ve got him here, and we have to use him in the right way now. There are no excuses now. I am responsible, and I’m telling you there are no excuses now, so whatever happens from this point onwards is down to me. ‘I cannot say one thing one day and then change when it suits me. We were missing something in front of goal, but now we’ve got Jermain. Now I need to keep him fit and playing, and find a way with Jermain on the pitch to make him score goals. That’s my challenge now.’ Poyet has revealed that he used his friendship with Defoe – who he worked with at Spurs - to get the deal started, before handing over to sporting director Lee Congerton to thrash out the terms of his £80,000-per-week contract. Poyet was pleased with how quickly Sunderland moved to sign Defoe ahead of their league rivals. The Uruguayan – who could now start Defoe at White Hart Lane – explained: ‘When the club was happy to start finding out about the possibility, I talked to Jermain. Simple. ‘I knew that Jermain would tell me the truth. He wouldn’t say, “Let me wait and see, and maybe I’ll give you an answer next week or in another week’s time”. It was straightforward. ‘When I knew what Jermain told me, I went back to Lee and said, “Now the ball is on your side of the court”. As soon as I spoke to Jermain, I knew we had a chance, and that was the main thing. We had a proper chance, and it proved right, so credit to Jermain. ‘Then all the rest of the deal was tough, there were so many things involved, but that is credit to the club.’ Highlights:","output":"- Sunderland manager Gus Poyet states that there can be no more excuses for his team's shortcomings after signing Jermain Defoe from Toronto FC. - Poyet has repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction with the attacking options at his disposal. - Sunderland is the second-lowest scoring team in the Premier League, with only 18 goals to their name. - Poyet believes signing Defoe brings a much-needed lift to the club, and the team must perform better. - Defoe is in contention to face his former side, Tottenham, at White Hart Lane. - Poyet reveals that he used his friendship with Defoe, forged during their time together at Spurs, to initiate the deal, which was then finalized by sporting director Lee Congerton. - Poyet is pleased with how quickly Sunderland acted to sign Defoe, securing an £80,000-per-week contract for the striker. - The Uruguayan manager is now focused on keeping Defoe fit and helping him score goals for the team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what is the political tea party? Would \\"The name of the movement is derived from the Boston Tea Party of 1773, an iconic event in American history.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"The name of the movement is derived from the Boston Tea Party of 1773, an iconic event in American history\\" is a reasonable answer, but it doesn't fully explain the contemporary political Tea Party. Let me elaborate on the movement for a better understanding: Step 1: Begin by explaining the origin of the term. The political Tea Party is a movement in the United States that takes its name from the historical event, the Boston Tea Party of 1773, which was a protest against the British government's taxation policies. Step 2: Elaborate on the modern political movement. The contemporary Tea Party movement emerged around 2009 as a grassroots, conservative political movement with a strong focus on limited government, fiscal responsibility, and lower taxes. Step 3: Describe relevant events and policy stances. The Tea Party gained prominence in the United States through a series of rallies, protests, and the election of candidates that supported their views in Congress. Key policy stances of the Tea Party include advocating for a balanced budget, reduced government spending, and opposition to the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). Step 4: Mention its impact on American politics. The Tea Party has had a significant impact on American politics, particularly within the Republican Party, as it has pushed the party in a more conservative direction, challenging traditional Republican views on certain policy issues. In summary, the political Tea Party is a conservative movement in the United States that advocates for limited government, fiscal responsibility, and lower taxes. It is named after the Boston Tea Party, an iconic event in American history, and has had a profound impact on contemporary American politics."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki. The Kon-Tiki expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish Conquistadors of Inca rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between South America and Polynesia. The Kon-Tiki smashed into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000 km) journey across the Pacific Ocean. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life.  Kon-Tiki demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl's book about The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas has been translated into 70 languages. The documentary film of the expedition entitled Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called Kon-Tiki, and was nominated for both the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe.  Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was settled from west to east, based on linguistic, physical, and genetic evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American sweet potato is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis. This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands. However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that. Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he go on the expedition alone?","output":"No, he did not go on the expedition alone. The text states, \\"In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki.\\" This quote clearly states that Thor Heyerdahl was accompanied by five fellow adventurers on his expedition."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

I was a student nurse at the time. I was assisting in the delivery of an infant. My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

Please answer the following question: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the given short movie review, it appears that the critic is thinking positively about the movie. The phrase \\"never seems hopelessly juvenile\\" suggests that the movie, Metropolis, does not come across as immature or unsophisticated. In essence, the critic implies that Metropolis is more mature and intellectually developed than one might expect, and this is conveyed through positive wording. The use of the word \\"never\\" in the review is particularly important to note, as the critic emphasizes the point that, at no point during the movie does it seem childish or unsophisticated. This further strengthens the positive tone. Moreover, the semicolon in the sentence plays a crucial role in generating the overall positive meaning. It functions to connect two closely related ideas, both of which have negative connotations (negative and hopelessly juvenile). By doing so, it emphasizes that Metropolis never falls into the category of negative or juvenile. In this context, the negative connotation directly connects to the positive outcome and reveals the critic's appreciation for the film. To summarize, the critic's review of Metropolis suggests a positive opinion on the movie, as it seemingly never resorts to being hopelessly juvenile.

The New York Times This shame, as much as the crimes of the Germans, was the human stain that darkened and spread over Levi’s long career. His radical humanism kept him from taking refuge in “us and them” distinctions — he was much more focused on the shame of the species. (Unlike Eli Wiesel, Levi — a highly assimilated Jew — never quarrels with God, in whom he did not believe even as a young man.) But despite his rational stance, human guilt took on mystical overtones in his work, and can seem a sort of belated original sin. It’s bound up with the question, which troubles all his writing, of whether his time in Auschwitz was a season in hell or a glimpse of the true condition of the world. That question haunts these stories as well. The possibility of transcendent evil is felt with great force in “The Molecule’s Defiance” (1980), a seemingly straightforward account of a night at a factory that grows sinister when a vast batch of resin forms a single monster-molecule and bursts free of its container. “The hatch rose by itself, not suddenly but gently, solemnly, as when tombs open and the dead arise.” The palpable dread comes not from the fear of an explosion or the loss of a night’s work or the expectation of reprimand that dogs the chemist on duty, but from a kind of moral sickness, a sense that evil has sunk into the very molecular structure of the world. “A fire or an explosion can be a much more destructive accident, even tragic,” the narrator tells us, “but it’s not disgraceful, like a gelatinization.” In “The Periodic Table,” Levi offered the dead of Auschwitz not a spiritual afterlife but a sort of chemical one, imagining, in his final chapter, the way a single atom of carbon might cycle back into the living world, ingested by the author and transformed almost mystically into a dot on the page of the book he is writing. But this image of rational scientific rescue is undone in a story like “The Molecule’s Defiance,” where the laws of science do not seem rational at all. Instead of each molecule having “two hands” that form an elegant “rosary,” they develop a third hand and then “every rosary joins with two or three other rosaries, and in the end they’ve formed a single molecule, a monster.” Religious imagery overwhelms scientific language, and all the irrational elements that Levi recoiled from in human society seem to have penetrated the very fabric of the universe. One feels this as well in a story like “Knall” (1971), a pseudowhimsical dispatch on a short tool, “thick as a Tuscan cigar,” that has become vastly popular, a kind of deadly fashion accessory that can kill at close range, leaving no sign of trauma on the corpse. The name, of course, is German — the narrator tells us it means “crack, bang, crash.” But what makes the story so Levian is the mixture of humor, detachment and underlying disgust. In his careful, deadpan manner, the narrator notes that the knall is fired by “a precise and rhythmic sequence of twists in one direction and then the other,” and that “exploded knalls are darker and more flaccid than unused ones.” And though it may be true that sometimes a cigar-shaped implement of destruction is just a cigar-shaped implement of destruction, the story is indeed emblematic of something powerfully Swiftian in Levi’s work, where political disgust and human disgust bleed into each other. “Buffet Dinner” (1977) is the most Swiftian story of all, an account of a fancy dinner party at which the invited guests somehow include a kangaroo, navigating the human scene with excruciating awkwardness. The animal, with its “triangle of white fur,” clearly has the author’s sympathy, but the story conveys more than the difficulty of the outsider/survivor trying to fit into a life of trivial civility. There is distaste for the human animals as well as shame for the kangaroo, who relieves himself in a houseplant and then eats some of its leaves before finally fleeing. Levi’s human discomfort preceded his enslavement — in “Survival in Auschwitz,” he described himself as a repressed young man who, in part because of the self-consciousness imposed by four years of anti-Jewish laws, as well as by temperament, had lived before Auschwitz in “an unrealistic world of my own, a world inhabited by civilized Cartesian phantoms, by sincere male and bloodless female friendships.” He was “liberated” by Auschwitz in certain complex, paradoxical ways that filled him with pride and self-recrimination. In some sense, Levi’s endless theme is Freud’s notion, in “Civilization and Its Discontents,” that man can stand neither repression nor the lifting of repression. Not having a divine idea of human nature, Levi was constantly exposing the fault lines of secular humanism — he defended human dignity even as he developed a growing sense that the human animal was somehow indefensible. Despite many memoirs, he almost never wrote as a husband or father, though he was both, which further complicates our understanding of his vision of life. Though he has become a sort of secular saint, he can often seem like Michelangelo’s Christ in “The Last Judgment,” turning away coldly from the saved even as he consigns the sinners to hell. But Levi’s heroism as a writer is felt everywhere in his work. The committed intelligence of his voice offers its own deep consolation, however bleak his vision became and however tempted he was to flee, like Gulliver, from a species that had fallen lower than the beasts. Gulliver began looking at his face in the mirror as a way of training himself to tolerate again the sight of a human creature. Levi, in these ingenious and disquieting stories as in the rest of his writing, held up a mirror to his own mind, and in so doing performed a lasting service. After the barbarisms of the last century — which have followed us into this one — reading Levi remains an indispensable way of readapting ourselves to the complexity of being human. Jonathan Rosen is the editorial director of Nextbook. His most recent novel is “Joy Comes in the Morning.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is a review of Primo Levi's short stories and their themes, focusing on the way his experiences in Auschwitz and his perspective on humanity influenced his writing. The author, Jonathan Rosen, discusses how Levi's stories address questions about transcendent evil, the human stain, and the nature of human dignity. Levi's writing is characterized by a mixture of humor, detachment, and underlying disgust, reflecting his personal struggles with the complexities of being human. Despite Levi's bleak vision, his heroism as a writer is felt throughout his work, offering consolation and insight into the human condition after the barbarisms of the 20th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 46*u - 3*u + 43 = 0 for u.","output":"Sure, we'll start by solving the equation 46*u - 3*u + 43 = 0 step by step. First, you should combine like-terms on the left hand side. In this case, the like-terms are 46*u and -3*u. When you subtract 3*u from 46*u, you get 43*u: 46*u - 3*u + 43 = 0  simplifies to 43*u + 43 = 0 The next step is to isolate the u-variable. You do this by getting rid of any terms that do not involve the variable you're solving for on the left hand side.  This means you'll need to subtract 43 from both sides of the equation to remove +43 from the left side. This maintains the balance of the equation (anything you do to one side must be done to the other side, as well): 43*u + 43 - 43 = 0 - 43 simplifies to 43*u = -43 At this stage, your equation should be 43*u = -43. Now, it's time to solve for u. To do this, you'll need to divide both sides of the equation by 43: 43*u / 43 = -43 / 43 simplifies to u = -1 Based on these calculations, the solution to the equation 46*u - 3*u + 43 = 0 is u = -1. This means that if you substitute -1 for u in your original equation, it should maintain the equality. Substituting u in the original equation: 46*(-1) - 3*(-1) + 43 = 0 This simplifies to: -46 + 3 + 43 = 0 And further to: 0 = 0 Since both sides of your equation equals 0 after substitising u = -1, this check validates your solution. So, indeed, u = -1 is the solution of your equation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Both sentences indicate that Ruffner, who is 45 years old, currently does not have legal representation for the murder charge they are facing, as reported by authorities.  In the first sentence, \\"Ruffner, 45, doesn't yet have an attorney in the murder charge, authorities said,\\" the use of \\"doesn't yet have\\" suggests that Ruffner may eventually obtain legal representation for the charge, but as of now, they remain without an attorney. The word \\"yet\\" highlights the potential for future change in Ruffner's legal situation. Additionally, here the term \\"attorney\\" is used, which is synonymous with \\"lawyer.\\" In the second sentence, \\"Ruffner, 45, does not have a lawyer on the murder charge, authorities said,\\" the phrase \\"does not have\\" communicates the same absence of legal representation for Ruffner but lacks the slight nuance of a possibility for a change in the future. This sentence uses the term \\"lawyer,\\" which is interchangeable with \\"attorney.\\" Despite these minor differences in phrasing and word choice, both sentences ultimately deliver the same information: Ruffner, a 45-year-old individual, is facing a murder charge and, according to authorities, has not yet secured the assistance of legal counsel."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's talk about a movie that's really fun, it's called \\"Finding Nemo.\\" It's a colorful animation about a little fish named Nemo who gets lost in the big, big ocean. So, Nemo is a tiny clownfish who lives with his dad, Marlin, in a safe and snug anemone. One day, Nemo gets very curious and naughty, and swims too far from his home. Oh, no! A fisherman catches him and transfers him to a fish tank in a dentist's office, which is really long and kind of scary journey away. Even though his dad is usually scared of everything, he becomes a superdad to find Nemo. He meets a really forgetful fish named Dory, who can't remember things properly, but she's very sweet, and becomes his best friend. The movie is like a big adventurous journey, where you encounter sharks who are trying to be vegetarians, turtles who like to surf the ocean currents, and seagulls who can only say \\"mine, mine\\".

Article: College students constantly hear the praises of education.We have all become used to believing that a college education is always a guarantee of an easier life.I was nine years old when my fourth-grade teacher presented me with a task, to write down all of the things I wanted in my life.I filled my paper with things like: own a big house and have servants; be rich and have a good job.The next day my teacher handed back my paper and in red ink she wrote: \\" GO TO COLLEGE.\\" For a long time, I was convinced that once I obtained an education, BAM! Life would be easier. However, education cannot promise all wishes, dreams, and desires.Society must reject the foolish idea that a college education's main purpose is to satisfy our desires and secure success.Like most challenging things, education is a gamble   in which results depend entirely on people's ability to look past their wants to see the realism and reason behind their wants. For instance, my first year of college, I took a sociology class.In class, we were taught that Third World countries were poor.We learned that our quality of life would be almost impossible for an average person in those countries.I began to examine my own desire to be rich.To always go after money felt selfish when knowing others had none at all.Learning about other society's financial situations forced me to look beyond what I wanted. Through the process of education, everything once desired is tested.Wanting something no longer is enough; it's more important to examine why we want it and whether we really want it.When my desire for money changed, everything changed.I stopped longing for money-driven careers and stopped valuing the people who had them.I began to examine the things I purchased and my reason for wanting them. Education is a tool to be used to develop and advance our desires, so we can discover the things that are truly significant in life.Education is a source to expand our society to see beyond the superficial   appeals and the \\"quick fixes\\" , leaving the belief of an...

Answer: Answer:","output":"The author mentions her sociology class to illustrate how education can reshape our desires and help us see beyond our superficial wants. In the sociology class, she learned about the financial struggles and living conditions in Third World countries, which made her reevaluate her own desire for wealth and material possessions. This realization led her to change her focus from money-driven careers and examine her own consumer choices.

This place was in the northern part of the city. Lots of big trucks, cars, and buses came in and out of the terminal every day moving people and things all around. One day, a man came to this busy terminal. He was wearing a hard hat and jacket, which made him look like the other workers there. Sometimes, people wear clothes like these to stay safe while working with heavy tools and machines. But this man was not there to work; he was there to trick everyone. He started talking to the people who worked at the terminal and made them believe that he was their friend. He said, \\"Hey, I work here too, even though you might not recognize me\\". The people at the transport terminal believed him because he was wearing the same kind of clothes as them. So, they thought of him as their co-worker. The sneaky man had a plan. He told the staff at the transport terminal that he needed to borrow something called \\"metal road plates.\\" These are big, flat pieces of metal that are used to cover up holes in the road when people are working on them. Each of the metal road plates is very expensive, costing £600, which is about the same as 600 ice cream cones! He wanted to take five of these metal road plates away with him. And guess what? Because the workers at Bounds Green transport terminal thought that the man was their friend, they let him take the five metal road plates. He was very clever in tricking them and they never even realized that he was not their co-worker.

While my experience was far better than last time, I just still think this place lacks, well, a lot.  There were two patrons in the bar and only two more that entered in a two hour time period. Granted, it was Wednesday, but it's hard to imagine how this place can stay in business.   It was a bit awkward because there was no music playing, so I felt compelled to play something on the jukebox.

Answer the following question: Process: - Air is brought in through the mouth - Passes through the lungs - And into the bronchial tissue - The carbon dioxide is removed - The lungs bring the oxygen to the rest of the body.  Question: suppose if lungs stop working properly and at a lower rate happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"When the lungs are not working properly and are functioning at a lower rate, it leads to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. This situation could arise due to various factors, such as respiratory diseases, lung injuries, or other conditions that affect lung function. The diminished supply of oxygen in the bloodstream can have several consequences, as it affects various aspects of the body's functionality. To understand the implications of this situation, let's first consider the role that oxygen plays within the body. Oxygen is crucial for various bodily processes, and is necessary for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary molecule used to store and transfer energy within cells. When there is an insufficient supply of oxygen, it impacts the body's ability to create energy to fuel vital cellular processes.  The smaller amount of oxygen delivered to the bloodstream affects the body in several ways: 1. Decreased energy production: With less oxygen available, the body is unable to produce sufficient ATP to meet its energy needs. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and reduced physical endurance, as the body struggles to perform even basic tasks. 2. Lower tissue and organ function: A lack of oxygen supply can impair the function of various tissues and organs, as insufficient energy compromises their ability to carry out normal processes. Over time, this can lead to the degradation of these tissues and possible organ failure. 3. Compromised immune function: The immune system relies on a consistent supply of oxygen to carry out its functions effectively. A diminished oxygen supply can weaken the immune system, increasing vulnerability to infections and illnesses. 4. Acid-base imbalance: When oxygen levels are low, the body may shift to using anaerobic processes for producing energy, which leads to the increased production of lactic acid. This can cause an acid-base imbalance, known as acidosis, resulting in a variety of symptoms including shortness of breath, confusion, and even coma in severe cases. 5. Cognitive impairment: The brain relies on a steady oxygen supply to function optimally. When oxygen levels decrease, cognitive functions such as memory, decision-making, and problem-solving can be negatively impacted. 6. Cardiovascular effects: In an attempt to compensate for the lower oxygen levels, the heart may pump blood faster in an effort to increase the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. This can put strain on the heart, leading to increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and possible long-term cardiovascular effects. In summary, the supposed perturbation of lungs functioning at a lower rate, leading to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, has a significant and negative effect on the body. The consequences range from decreased energy production and impaired organ function to compromised immune function, acid-base imbalances, cognitive impairment, and potential cardiovascular effects. It is essential to maintain proper lung function to ensure adequate oxygen supply and overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie plot title: The Enforcer Movie plot: In Marin County, two gas company men are lured by a scantily-clad woman to a remote spot in Mill Valley and killed by Bobby Maxwell (DeVeren Bookwalter). Maxwell's gang, the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), plans to use the gas men's uniforms and van as part of an ambitious series of crimes that will make them rich. Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his partner Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), after dealing with a chronic fainter, arrive at a liquor store where robbers have taken hostages. The robbers demand a car with a police radio; the inspector provides one by driving his squad car into the store and shooting the robbers. His superior Captain McKay (Bradford Dillman) reprimands Callahan for \\"excessive use of force\\", injuring the hostages, and causing 14,379 of damage to the store, and temporarily transfers him out of the Homicide unit. While assigned to Personnel, Callahan participates in the interview process for promotions, and learns that affirmative action means that three of the new inspectors will be female including Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), despite her very limited field experience. The PRSF uses the gas company van to steal M72 LAW rockets, Colt M16 rifles, a Taser and other weapons from a warehouse. In the course of the robbery, three people are killed: a security guard whom Maxwell kills for his keys; DiGiorgio, whom Maxwell stabs in the back after he stumbles in on the robbery after discovering the guard's body; one of Maxwell's accomplices is accidentally shot when DiGiorgio's gun goes off.

Given the question: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running.  Which runner had an increased blood flow to the muscles? The answer is:","output":"Tom had an increased blood flow to the muscles.  Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking which of the two runners, Tom and Jim, had increased blood flow to their muscles. To answer this, we need to understand the effects of warming up on muscles. Step 2: Analyze the information From the given information, we know that a proper warm-up gradually increases the intensity of a physical activity, which in turn helps to prepare the muscles for the activity. Warming up increases blood flow to the muscles and raises the heart rate, which results in warmed-up muscles and tendons being less likely to get injured. Step 3: Compare the two runners Tom warmed up properly before running, while Jim skipped his warm-up. This means that Tom experienced the benefits of warming up, such as increased blood flow to his muscles and an increased heart rate, while Jim did not. Step 4: Answer the question Based on the analysis, we can conclude that Tom had an increased blood flow to the muscles because he properly warmed up before running."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],D={key:0},N={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
