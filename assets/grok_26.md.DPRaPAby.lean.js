You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Could mumps cause deafness? Could deafness caused by mumps be cured? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Mumps is a viral infection caused by the mumps virus, typically affecting children and young adults. The disease primarily affects the salivary glands, causing inflammation and swelling. While mumps can cause a variety of complications, one of the most serious complications is sensorineural hearing loss, which could lead to deafness. Deafness caused by mumps is usually a result of the virus damaging the delicate structures within the inner ear responsible for transmitting sound waves into electrical signals. The cochlea and auditory nerve are particularly susceptible to mumps-related damage, which can lead to unilateral (in one ear) or bilateral (in both ears) hearing loss. This hearing loss varies in severity and can range from mild to profound deafness. It is more common for mumps-induced deafness to affect just one ear. It is important to note that although deafness caused by the mumps virus is relatively rare, it can occur in about 1 in every 20,000 mumps cases. As a result, it is crucial to vaccinate against the mumps virus through the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, which has proven to be effective in greatly reducing the number of mumps cases and associated complications globally. As for the second part of your query, whether deafness caused by mumps can be cured largely depends on the extent of the damage to the inner ear structures. In some cases, the hearing loss can be temporary, with hearing improving significantly after a few weeks or months. In such situations, it is considered a reversible cause of hearing loss. However, if the damage is severe, especially if it involves the cochlea or auditory nerve, the resultant deafness can be permanent. Unfortunately, there is no specific antiviral treatment for mumps-induced hearing loss, and any medical intervention mainly focuses on managing the symptoms and providing supportive care. For individuals with permanent hearing loss resulting from mumps, hearing aids and cochlear implants can be helpful in improving hearing to a certain extent. A cochlear implant may be considered if the hearing loss is severe and hearing aids do not provide sufficient benefit. Additionally, speech therapy, sign language, and other communication strategies can play an essential role in improving the quality of life for individuals with hearing loss. Now, to address the third part of your question, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. While both questions deal with deafness and its relation to mumps, the first question explores whether mumps can cause deafness, while the second question seeks to understand if deafness caused by mumps can be cured. The two questions are related but have different focal points, with the first question establishing the causal link between mumps and deafness, and the second question examining the possibility of reversing this condition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who did Robie and Frances run into at the beach? Title: To Catch a Thief Movie plot: \\"The Cat\\" is John Robie (Cary Grant). Now a respectable and well-to-do grower of grapes and flowers on the French Riviera, before World War II he was a jewel thief -- a cat burglar -- who was imprisoned but granted parole so he could fight the Germans. Someone is using the Cat's M.O. to steal jewelry again, and the police think Robie must be involved. When they visit his handsome stone villa to take him in for questioning, he gives them the slip with help from his housekeeper Germaine (Georgette Anys), who leads the cops on a car chase while Robie catches the bus.He drops in on his old gang from the French Resistance, a group of ex-cons whose war work, like Robie's own, led to grants of parole that depend on keeping their noses clean. Restaurant manager Bertani (Charles Vanel), wine steward Foussard (Jean Martinelli), and the others are all under a cloud while the Cat is at large, and they blame Robie. Still, when the police arrive at Bertani's restaurant, Foussard's teenaged daughter Danielle (Brigitte Auber), who has apparently enjoyed flirting with Robie in the past, spirits him across the bay in a motorboat to the safety of a Cannes beach club.Robie enlists the aid of an insurance man of Bertani's acquaintance, H.H. Hughson (John Williams) of Lloyds of London, in order to prove his innocence. Robie's plan is to catch the new cat burglar in the act. To do this, he obtains a list of the most expensive jewels on the Riviera from the reluctant Hughson. The first name on the list is Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis), who is traveling with her daughter Francie (Grace Kelly). Robie strikes up an acquaintance with them -- one met with delight by Jessie, a pretense of modesty by Francie, and claws-baring jealousy from Danielle.Francie is not afraid of a little fun.

In 1942, Nazi Germany attempts to bring neutral Turkey into the war on its side by staging an assassination attempt on Franz von Papen, its own ambassador to the country. Much to the annoyance of Colonel Robinson, von Papen survives and the Russians that his agent provocateur was trying to frame have solid alibis, forcing him to turn to another scheme to inflame Turkey's traditional rivalry with Russia.  Meanwhile, American machinery salesman Joe Barton boards the Baghdad-Istanbul Express train at Aleppo and is attracted to another passenger, Ana Remzi. She is worried about being searched by customs agents once they reach the Turkish border; she asks Joe to hold on to an envelope containing some securities, all that remains of her inheritance. Joe obliges, but when he later examines the envelope, he finds maps of Turkey with writing on them. When they stop in Ankara, he goes to her hotel to return her property, only to find she has been fatally wounded. He hides when someone else approaches the room. He watches unobserved as Soviet spy Nikolai Zaleshoff searches the dead woman's luggage. Then, Joe exits through the window. Leaving the scene, he is seen by Tamara Zaleshoff, Nikolai's sister and partner in espionage. The Turkish police take Joe in for questioning, only it turns out that they are German agents. They take him to their leader, Colonel Robinson. Robinson wants the maps. Joe refuses to cooperate, and is taken away to be interrogated by Mailler. Before the Germans get very far, Joe is rescued by Nikolai. When the Zaleshoffs reveal that they are Soviet agents, Joe agrees to fetch them the documents.

There are many different varieties of rpg you might decide to create. Common versions include tabletop, live action role-playing (larp), and pen-and-paper.","output":"Once you have settled on the type of RPG you wish to create, it becomes essential to carefully consider the elements that will make your game unique, engaging, and appealing to your target audience. To write comprehensive rules for your RPG, follow these comprehensive steps: 1. Set the game's world and theme: Decide on the environment, era, and overall theme for your game. This could be anything from a medieval fantasy land filled with elves, dwarves, and magic, to a futuristic space frontier filled with alien species and advanced technology. Your setting will influence the overall tone and feel of the game and set the stage on which your players will interact. 2. Develop a core game mechanic: Choose or invent a primary game mechanic that will govern the majority of player actions and interactions within the game world. Common methods include dice-rolling systems or card-based mechanisms. Make sure to adequately explain the mechanic in your rules, so players can quickly learn, understand, and implement it during gameplay. 3. Create character types and stats: Develop guidelines for creating characters in your RPG, including races, classes, and professions that players can choose from. Create a comprehensive set of attributes or stats that define a character's abilities, such as their strength, agility, intelligence, and charisma, among others. This step should also include instructions on how players can customize their characters, such as allocating skill points or selecting unique abilities. 4. Establish combat and conflict resolution rules: One of the major aspects of RPGs is the resolution of conflicts, typically in the form of combat. Develop a clear, well-defined combat system that outlines the process of initiating and resolving combat. This should include rules for determining turn order, actions available to characters each turn, and mechanics for resolving attacks, defending, and using special abilities. 5. Outline the magic system (if applicable): If magic, psychic powers, or other supernatural elements exist in your RPG world, create a coherent and balanced system governing their usage. Define different types of magic or abilities, how characters can obtain them, and the limitations and drawbacks of using these powers. 6. Design equipment and resource systems: Establish an inventory system that enables players to acquire, manage, and use a wide variety of items, weapons, and armor. Additionally, outline any resource management aspects, such as how characters obtain, spend, and track their in-game currency, like gold pieces or credits. 7. Create a leveling and progression system: Define how characters become more capable and powerful over time through experience and advancement. Detail the requirements and rewards of leveling up, such as increasing character stats, gaining new abilities, or improving their equipment. 8. Develop a social interaction system: Create a system for player characters to interact with non-player characters (NPCs) and other players in the game, both cooperatively and competitively. Develop a system for handling in-game conversations, persuasions, and intimidations, as well as guidelines for forming alliances and rivalries between characters. 9. Construct rules for exploration and travel: Define how your players will traverse the game world, whether on foot, horseback, by airship, or through more exotic means of transport. Outline mechanics for navigating different terrains, hazards, and survival challenges, like weather conditions or foraging for supplies. 10. Create scenarios, adventures, and campaigns: Provide examples of adventures and outline a general framework for creating campaigns, storylines, or scenarios that GMs can use to guide players on their journey through your RPG's world. Lastly, remember that collaboration and playtesting are vital to ensuring the success of your RPG. Be sure to gather feedback from your target audience, make adjustments to the rules based on their experiences, and continue playtesting until you have developed a game that is engaging, balanced, and enjoyable for players of all levels.

He has always been fascinated by the legends surrounding Godzilla. An avid believer in the existence of Godzilla, Yamane has dedicated his life to unraveling the mystery behind this mythical creature and finding out the truth behind its origins. His research leads him to discover a pattern of unexplained natural disasters that seem to be interconnected with the sightings of Godzilla. He assembles a team of skilled researchers - including his daughter Emiko (played by Rinko Kikuchi) and her fiancé Hideto Ogata (played by Tadanobu Asano) - to help him locate and study Godzilla. Yamane is convinced that studying Godzilla will not only help humanity understand the creature's existence but also pave the way to finding solutions to many of Earth's environmental challenges. Despite constant ridicule from the scientific community and pressure from government agencies, Yamane's team perseveres and eventually stumbles upon a mysterious island. This uncharted territory, referred to as 'Monster Island' by the locals, is believed to be the home of Godzilla. As they set foot on the island, they are awestruck by the unique and often deadly flora and fauna that inhabit the land. Soon after their arrival, the team's equipment picks up the presence of an enormous creature approaching the island. Amidst the chaos, the legendary Godzilla finally appears before them, leaving the team awestruck. As Yamane and his team start to study Godzilla, they are confounded by the creature's strange connection to Earth's natural disasters.

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Benedykt Ossolinsky, age 39, began to grow childish. On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits. The family had only planned for three months of vacation time a year. Scandal! As a sign of protest he took to coming to the office wearing a t-shirt with the slogan \\"Attention, Baby!\\" on it.

Chris leaves his address at the home of Edgar Frog, the town's surfboard shaper, in hopes of getting a job. Chris is approached at their new home by former pro surfer, Shane Powers (played by Angus Sutherland the half brother of Kiefer Sutherland who played David from the original film), who invites him to a party that night. Chris and Nicole go to the party, where Shane and his friends Kyle, Erik and Jon are entertaining themselves with the human guests. Chris showers with a girl named Lisa and Shane gets Nicole alone, chats with her for a bit, and then tricks her into drinking his blood. When Chris learns that Nicole has been with Shane, he angrily, and protectively, takes her home, where she begins to manifest vampiric strength and rage. But before Nicole kills Chris, she is knocked out by Edgar, who reveals that he is a vampire hunter, and Nicole has been infected with vampirism. Chris throws Edgar out of the house. Then, Lisa shows up and pretends to chat with Chris for a bit before she finally tries to seduce and feed on him.

In flashback, David is shown to be the wealthy owner of a large publishing firm in New York City which he inherited from his father, leaving its regular duties to his father's trusted associates. As David enjoys the bachelor lifestyle, he is introduced to Sofia Serrano (PenÃ©lope Cruz) by his best friend, author Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) at a party. David and Sofia spend a night together talking and fall in love. When David's former lover, Julianna \\"Julie\\" Gianni (Cameron Diaz), hears of Sofia, she attempts to kill herself and David in a car crash. Julie dies but David survives, his face grotesquely disfigured,[4] leading him to wear a mask to hide the injuries. With no hope to use plastic surgery to repair the damage, David cannot come to grips with the idea of wearing the mask for the rest of his life. On a night out with Sofia and Brian, David gets hopelessly drunk and Sofia and Brian leave David to wallow in the street outside. David is awakened the next day in the street by Sofia, who apologises for deserting him the night before, and takes him home. The two continue to see each other, and David has his face surgically repaired despite being told it was impossible before. Though his life seems perfectly content, David finds oddities, such as brief visions of his distorted face, and a man (Noah Taylor) at a bar that tells him David can control the world and everyone in it, if he wanted to. One day, when he goes to Sofia's apartment, he finds Julie there instead; all of the previous mementos of Sofia now show Julie's face. Angry and confused, David suffocates Julie, and is later arrested and placed in a mental institution, finding his face has reverted to its previously disfigured state.

A 45 minute delay followed before another bus showed up to transfer us . The new bus was in worse shape and made terrible grinding noises like the gears were shot every time the driver shifted . Question Why did the bus break down ? Answer:","output":"The bus broke down due to a combination of factors, including potential mechanical issues, poor maintenance, and possible operator errors. From the information provided, it is evident that the bus was not in the best condition and had some underlying problems that eventually led to the breakdown. 1. Mechanical Issues: One of the primary reasons for the breakdown could be the presence of various mechanical issues in the bus. Considering the fact that the replacement bus was also in terrible shape and made grinding noises, it is likely that the first bus also had mechanical problems. This can include anything from a faulty transmission system, problems with the engine, or issues with other crucial components like the braking system, suspension or exhaust system. Any one of these issues can lead to a bus breaking down during its operation. 2. Poor Maintenance: Buses, like any other vehicle, require regular maintenance to keep them running smoothly. From the context provided, it is clear that maintenance may not have been a priority for the bus operator. The vehicles may not have undergone the necessary regular check-ups, replacements, and repairs, which can gradually lead to the deterioration of their performance. When buses are not maintained properly, it increases the possibility of sudden malfunctions, breakdowns, and even accidents. 3. Operator Errors: It is also possible that the bus driver played a role in the breakdown. The driver might have engaged in certain driving behaviors that exacerbated the existing mechanical issues or created new problems. For example, they might have shifted gears incorrectly, placed extra strain on the engine by over-revving it, or consistently ignored warning signs like unusual noises or vibrations. While operator errors might not be the sole cause of the breakdown, they can contribute to the overall decline in the vehicle's performance and reliability. 4. Age and Overall Condition of the Bus: Another contributing factor could be the age and overall condition of the bus. As a vehicle ages, its components wear down and become more susceptible to failures and breakdowns. This is especially true if the bus has been in use for many years and has not been properly maintained. The fact that the roommate had predicted a possible breakdown suggests that the bus might have had a reputation for being unreliable due to its age and condition. To summarize, the breakdown of the bus was likely a result of mechanical issues, poor maintenance, operator errors, and the age and overall condition of the vehicle. In order to avoid such incidents in the future, it is crucial for the bus operators to conduct regular maintenance checks to identify and address any potential issues and ensure that their drivers are well-trained and follow good driving practices. This would not only improve the efficiency and reliability of the buses but also provide a safer and more comfortable commute for passengers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","output":"Title: Gerry McCabe Joins Dundee as Assistant Coach after Leaving Queen of the South Subtitle: McCabe Set to Assist Paul Hartley as Dundee Makes Their Return to the Scottish Premiership The Scottish football scene has seen a significant update as experienced coach Gerry McCabe has decided to part ways with his previous club, Queen of the South, to assume the role of assistant coach at Dundee. McCabe will engage in a two-year contract with the Scottish Premiership newcomers. This strategic move comes as Dundee eagerly anticipates their return to the top flight of Scottish football after securing promotion last season. Gerry McCabe's extensive experience and football acumen will surely be an asset to Dundee's coaching staff. McCabe has been heavily involved with football and coaching for over three decades. His impressive career began as a midfielder for clubs such as Clyde, Partick Thistle, and Ayr United, among others, throughout the late 20th century. Since his transition from the field to the sidelines, McCabe has provided his seasoned insights and talent as a coach for teams such as Hibernian, Dunfermline Athletic, and St. Mirren. This new role at Dundee will put McCabe alongside another Scottish football veteran, Paul Hartley. Hartley, a former professional player himself, has been the manager of Dundee since 2014 and guided the team to Scottish Premiership promotion in his first season in charge. Both coaches have a wealth of experience and knowledge that they bring to the table, and the combination will likely prove beneficial for Dundee as they take on this new challenge in the top tier of Scottish football. Gerry McCabe's move to Dundee has been positively received, and it is expected that his influence will enhance the club's performance on the field. Manager Paul Hartley expressed his excitement about their new addition, stating, \\"Gerry is an excellent coach with great experience, and I am delighted to have him on-board as we prepare for our return to the Scottish Premiership. His knowledge and expertise will be invaluable to our coaching staff and players.\\" The signing of Gerry McCabe is an essential piece of the puzzle for Dundee as they get ready to face their competitors in the Scottish Premiership. McCabe's seasoned insights and strategic mindset will be key to ensure the team's success on the field. Dundee's supporters can look forward to a bright future with this coaching duo at the helm, potentially paving the way for a stable and successful tenure in Scotland's top-flight football competition. Queen of the South will undoubtedly miss McCabe's contributions, as he spent the 2020-2021 season as assistant to manager Allan Johnston. However, the team and its fans wish him the best in his new endeavor and are undoubtedly grateful for the time he spent with the club. McCabe's move to Dundee marks a new chapter for the Scottish football scene, and fans from all teams can expect an exciting and competitive season ahead thanks to these experienced and skilled coaching professionals."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: James didn't like bringing his suit to court.

Available choices:  + negative;  + positive;","output":"The sentiment analysis of a tweet requires an understanding of the language, context, and the message conveyed by the tweet. However, the tweet you've given is '@khali_blache Si-iiiiin.' It seems to be a personal message or could be a part of a coded language or inside joke that the sender is sharing with @khali_blache. The meaning is not clear without additional context. The word 'Si-iiiiin' doesn't appear to be a standard language name/word or phrase, at least not in English. As a result, it's quite challenging to ascribe a sentiment to this tweet as it does not contain any well-defined positive or negative expressions. Usually, a sentiment analysis algorithm will look for positive, negative, or neutral words, phrases or emoticons to determine the sentiment of a piece of text or speech. This specific tweet, however, lacks identifiable positive or negative words. Generally, a positive sentiment may include expressions of joy, happiness, enthusiasm, gratitude, etc. On the other hand, negative sentiment may include sadness, anger, frustration, complaints, negativity, etc. Neutral sentiment generally means that the statement isn't exhibiting either positive or negative sentiment but is more informational. In this case, without further context regarding the meaning of 'Si-iiiiin' or the wider conversation around the tweet, it would be most accurate to classify the sentiment of this tweet as 'Neutral.' Please note that there might be a defined sentiment if the context or the exact meaning of 'Si-iiiiin' were known. The sentiment might change accordingly.    Certain machine learning models that leverage context, sequential information and prior knowledge may be able to extract more information from such tweets. For example, tools with natural language processing, if trained on the specific language or code this tweet might be in, could identify the sentiment. But without the context or without knowing the specifics of what 'Si-iiiiin' refers to, it would only be a guess. It's also worth considering that this tweet is directed towards a specific user (@khali_blache). If there's an understanding of the relationship between the tweet's author and this user or the context of their conversation, the sentiment might be better understood. Remember that sentiment analysis has its limitations, such as correctly identifying sarcasm, humor, or coded language, and that it's essential to take into account the broader context when analyzing sentiments in text. Tweets or text with slang, misspellings, or unclear structure could be challenging to analyze, like this example.    In summary, due to the non-standard language used and without additional context, we might categorize this tweet's sentiment as 'neutral' – until further clarifications or context are available."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

The White House defended President Barack Obama from criticism that he was tone deaf in his reaction to the mass shootings at Washington Navy Yard. Obama: Shooting a 'cowardly' act. For a second straight day, White House press secretary Jay Carney faced questions about a Monday afternoon event that occurred as the situation at the Navy Yard was still unfolding. Obama touched on the tragedy before forcefully criticizing conservative Republicans who are threatening to shut down the government. Obama pressures conservative Republicans. McCain to House Republicans: Don't shut down government. \\"I understand that some Republicans are trying to make something of this,\\" Carney said on Tuesday in response to a question from CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta. \\"The president spoke about the Navy Yard at the very top of his briefing. He talked about the cowardly act that had taken place, the tragedy that was unfolding and the loss of life and he called for and demanded a seamless investigation with federal and local law enforcement officials and that is what we're seeing now,\\" Carney said. Obama himself stepped in on Tuesday to address the controversy, telling Telemundo in an interview to \\"keep in mind\\" that he addressed the shooting while it was still going on, \\"while we were still gathering information.\\" He continued, \\"I think that everybody understands that the minute something like this happens, I'm in touch with the FBI, I'm in touch with my national security team, we're making sure that all the assets are out there for us to deal with this as well as we can.\\" On the other hand, Obama said, \\"what is also important to remember is that Congress has a lot of work to do right now\\" in a short period of time, noting looming fiscal deadlines that he says are crucial for the economy. Obama had planned on Tuesday to tout his economic accomplishments on the fifth anniversary of the Wall Street meltdown and criticize a group of conservative Republicans for their push to shut down the federal government if the national health care law isn't defunded. His comments were designed as a prelude to the White House battle plan in the fights over the upcoming deadlines over government funding, the debt ceiling, and as a Americans begin to start enrolling in the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. 5 things Obama planned before shooting. A distracted president struggles with the economy. White House officials did delay the event from late morning to early afternoon, to ensure that the president wouldn't be speaking at the same time at a news conference updating the evolving situation at the Navy Yard. But they said they never considered canceling the event. \\"We are confronting another mass shooting and it happened on a military installation in our nation's capital. It's a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel,\\" the president said at the top of his remarks. \\"These are men and women who were going to work, doing their jobs protecting all of us. They're patriots and they know the dangers of serving abroad but today they face the unimaginable violence that they wouldn't have expected here at home.\\" But minutes later Obama took the fight to some in the GOP, saying, \\"I cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it can't get 100% of what it wants. That's never happened before but that's what's happening right now,\\" and adding that forcing a shutdown would be the \\"height of irresponsibility.\\" Your guide to a government shutdown. Debt ceiling 'X date' could hit Oct. 18. The president's quick pivot first to the latest developments in the Syrian crisis and then into his criticism of the GOP stands in contrast to his initial reaction to last December's shooting of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, when he urged national unity. And it brought criticism from House Speaker John Boehner. \\"It's a shame that the president could not manage to rise above partisanship today,\\" the top Republican in Congress said in a statement a few hours after Obama's event. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus continued the attack on Tuesday, tweeting \\"Disappointing that POTUS couldn't rise above partisanship yesterday...hours after #NavyYardShooting\\" Former House Speaker and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich expanded on the criticism. \\"President Reagan, in the tragedy of the (space shuttle) Challenger, postponed the State of the Union address because he realized the country needed to be in mourning. President Obama should have recognized that an event this painful and tragic, in the nation's capital, required being president rather than partisan, and being concerned about people rather than concerned about attacking,\\" said Gingrich, a co-host of CNN's \\"Crossfire.\\" A top Republican strategist went a step farther. \\"When there is a tragic event like this in the nation's capital and the local baseball team expresses that it would be insensitive to participate in the national pastime, but the president proceeds with a self-congratulatory press conference to celebrate his miniscule economic accomplishments, it tells you the Obama administration has become tone-deaf,\\" said Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor who co-founded Purple Strategies, a bipartisan public affairs firm. \\"Bill Clinton, who 'felt our pain,' would never have made this mistake.\\" Opinion: Gun control is not the answer. It's not just Republicans who are critical of the president -- a senior Democratic consultant was critical of Obama's timing, too. \\"Suprisingly tone-deaf. National unity has been at the heart of the Obama brand since his 2004 'there are no red states and no blue states' speech. To pass up a chance to unite the country after a tragedy was a missed opportunity. Unhelpful in terms of politics. Even more unhelpful in terms of governance,\\" said the consultant, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely. While Carney says the president \\"was horrified by this news\\" (of the shootings), he defended Monday's White House event and wouldn't entertain any second day quarterbacking, saying \\"we knew what the public knew,\\" adding \\"we had the same information you did.\\" Will rampage move the dial on gun control? And he pushed back against criticism that Obama's speech was partisan. \\"Far from being a partisan speech, the president made clear in his speech that many Republicans on Capitol Hill agree with him that we should not go down the road of threatening to shut down the government or defaulting on our obligations in the name of some partisan agenda item,\\" Carney said. And White House officials questioned the appropriateness of some House Republicans who they say were launching partisan attacks at the administration on Monday over last September's deadly attack at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead. Later Monday, the tone did appear to shift at the White House. A Latin music event in the East Room that was planned for the evening was postponed, according to White House officials, \\"in light of today's tragic events at the Washington Navy Yard and out of respect for the victims and their families.\\" Around the same time, the U.S. flag on top of the White House was lowered to half staff.

Grandi warns Susan of dire consequences if her husband continues his prosecution of Grandi's brother, an imprisoned drug dealer awaiting trial in Mexico, but Susan is unimpressed.While investigating the case on the Mexican side of the border, Quinlan visits the tawdry brothel run by Tanya, a former lover (Marlene Dietrich), and the place fills him with nostalgic yearnings. Upon learning of Susan's encounter with Grandi, Vargas decides that she will be safer stashed in a motel on the American side of the border while he continues working on the Linnekar case. However, unknown to Vargas, the motel is owned by Grandi, staffed by a very nervous night clerk (Dennis Weaver), in the middle of the desert.Quinlan soon tracks down a suspect, a Mexican shoe clerk who was having an affair with Linnekar's daughter, Marcia (Joanna Moore), and later married her in a secret ceremony. Sanchez (Victor Millan) claims he is innocent and appeals to Vargas...

In 1999 he produced Cavalcade of Stars for Foxtel including repackaging segments of Young Talent Time and showcasing new Australian bands.  In December 2000, Young relocated to Perth to become the breakfast host on Perth AM station 6IX. During 2001 to 2004, he periodically performed with Rowe, Buddy England (ex-The Seekers, The Mixtures) and Marcie Jones (Marcie and The Cookies) as the 'Legends of Sixties Rock' at venues across Australia - all four had appeared on The Go-Show. While living in Perth, Young established a new outlet for his Johnny Young Talent School franchise. In 2001, the 30th anniversary of Young Talent Time was celebrated by Network Ten with a special documentary, Young Talent Time Tells All, which was followed on 4 November by a reunion party for former cast members. Young attended with his daughter Anna - who had appeared on the show. Back in Perth, Young hosted The Pet Show on ABC Television in 2006.  On 27 October 2010, Johnny Young was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.

Let's understand what he said and why it's important like we're five! Imagine you just got a big, colorful book of your favorite stories. You love the way the book looks, how it feels, and the amazing worlds the words and pictures take you to. Wouldn't it be sad if someone took that beautiful book and scribbled all over the pages, making it hard to read? That's sort of what Mike McCue says is happening to online journalism. You see, online journalism, or the news on the internet, started out like our beautiful storybook. But as time went by, people wanted to make money from it, so they put all these ads and weird things on the pages. This made the news harder to read and not as enjoyable as the original storybook. Mike calls this \\"contaminating\\" the news, meaning it's kind of like spilling chocolate milk all over your favorite book. Yuck! Now, Mike works at a company called Flipboard. They wanted to help fix this problem, so they made an app that takes the news from the internet and makes it look like a clean, fun-to-read magazine. It's like taking a dirty, chocolate milk-stained book and making it into a beautiful, easy-to-read one again! Mike believes that if everyone can learn from Flipboard and make online journalism more like our favorite storybooks, people will enjoy reading the news more, and it will be a better world for everyone. So, just like how we would want to keep our storybooks clean and beautiful, Mike McCue hopes we can all work together to make online journalism just as enjoyable and wonderful to read for everyone.

But he said there is no evidence at this stage that the killing was sanctioned by the organisation. The police assessment, he said, is that the Provisional IRA remains committed to politics and is not engaged in terrorism. Mr Hamilton said that \\"some of the Provisional IRA structure from the 1990s remains broadly in place\\" but its purpose \\"has radically changed since this period\\". \\"They are not on a war footing, they are not involved in paramilitary activity in the sense that they were during the period of the conflict,\\" he said. Mr McGuigan, 53, died after he was shot at his home in east Belfast in what detectives believe was a revenge attack for the killing of former IRA commander Gerard 'Jock' Davison in Belfast in May. The chief constable said the two murders were the results of a \\"fall-out\\" within the republican community. \\"Some current Provisional IRA and former members continue to engage in a range of criminal activity and occasional violence in the interest of personal gain or personal agendas,\\" he added. Mr Hamilton said the PSNI had no information to suggest that \\"violence as seen in the murder of Kevin McGuigan\\" was \\"sanctioned or directed at a senior level\\" in the republican movement. The main unionist and nationalist parties met with Mr Hamilton on Saturday to discuss the police probe into killing. Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly said his party would support the investigation. And he reiterated remarks by the party's president Gerry Adams in which he said the IRA was not involved in the murder. \\"The IRA stood down over 10 years ago,\\" Mr Kelly said. \\"Sinn Féin's commitment to peaceful and democratic progress is beyond question.\\" He added that the party had raised with Mr Hamilton \\"concerns about a number of speculative and unhelpful comments made recently\\". The DUP's Gregory Campbell said his party would be meeting with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers about the alleged role of IRA members in the killing. He added that there was no surprise among his party at the suggestions of IRA involvement. The Ulster Unionist Party also met with Mr Hamilton on Saturday. Party leader Mike Nesbitt said afterwards that Sinn Féin's credibility was \\"in tatters\\" and it needed to \\"accept some responsibility\\" for Mr McGuigan Sr's killing. \\"They continue to insult our intelligence by claiming no IRA involvement in this latest murder,\\" Mr Nesbitt said. After the SDLP's meeting with the chief constable, its leader Alasdair McDonnell said the \\"skeleton\\" of the IRA remains in existence. But he said the evidence was not there to collapse the assembly. That came in response to comments from First Minister Peter Robinson, who said he would discuss the prospect of excluding Sinn Féin from the executive with other Northern Ireland parties. A summary of the above article is?","output":"George Hamilton, Chief Constable, stated that some members of the Provisional IRA were involved in the murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr., but there's no evidence indicating the approval of the organization itself.

Review: \\"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies\\" is the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space.\\" At least that movie was just inept; the Lampoon film, on the other hand, is both inept and mean. Once upon a time, movies used to respect their audiences' intelligence. This one, however, holds a fetid, rotting carcass up to our faces -- and then tries to rub our noses in it. Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes; and I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice flesh it is. But the directors seem not to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it. There's none of that here. Perversely, the film makers save the worst for last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays an eager-beaver young police officer reporting for duty on his first day on the job. He is paired with a weary, cynical oldtimer played by Richard Widmark. For just a moment, we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly. Surely, we think, the youngster's spunky attitude will rub off on the cynic and change him for the better. Forlorn hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day -- and the youngster's spark is doused forever. \\"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies\\" and heads right for the toilet, asking us to follow it down the drain.

It depends on some number of factors, such as the amount of personal data, the company's complexity, the number of systems, and whether your business has previously worked with the area. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive privacy regulation implemented by the European Union (EU) to protect user data and to enforce strict guidelines on organizations that collect and process individual's personal data. Complying with GDPR is crucial for any business operating in, or targeting customers in, the EU. To estimate the costs of meeting the GDPR goals, several factors need to be considered. Here is a deeper look into these factors: 1. Amount of personal data: The size of the database containing personal information affects the cost of compliance significantly. Businesses with larger amounts of personal data may need to invest more resources in securing that data and implementing GDPR compliant processes. 2. Company complexity: Companies with a complex organizational structure might face higher costs. This is because they may need to modify various processes, systems, and business relationships to meet GDPR requirements. A simpler company structure may require less effort to implement changes across the organization, reducing the cost of compliance. 3. Number of systems: The number of systems that collect, process, or store personal data impacts the cost of GDPR compliance. Greater system integration and a more streamlined data flow can reduce the costs and risks associated with GDPR compliance. On the other hand, businesses that operate several disparate systems may need to invest more in integrating solutions and ensuring data privacy. 4. Previous experience with data protection: If the company has already worked on data security and privacy projects, it will likely have some expertise and groundwork in place, making it easier to comply with GDPR requirements. This could translate into reduced costs compared to companies that are starting from scratch. To understand the costs of reaching GDPR goals, businesses should first conduct an assessment of their current level of data protection and identify gaps in their processes and systems. Some potential costs include: 1. Staff training: Ensuring that employees are aware of GDPR requirements and are trained in handling personal data securely is crucial. This may involve hiring a Data Protection Officer (DPO) and paying for ongoing staff training courses. 2. Legal and consultancy fees: Working with legal and consultancy firms to help navigate GDPR compliance can be a significant cost for many businesses. 3. Technology investments: Companies may need to purchase or develop new software to facilitate data anonymization, pseudonymization, and encryption. They might also need to strengthen cybersecurity measures to minimize the risk of data breaches. 4. Documentation: Businesses are required to maintain and regularly update documentation related to data processing activities. This could lead to additional administrative and personnel costs. In conclusion, the cost of reaching GDPR goals can vary greatly depending on various factors within your business. It is essential to conduct a thorough assessment of your organization's data handling procedures and systems to determine an accurate cost estimate. Investing in GDPR compliance is not only legally required but can also help improve customer satisfaction and trust, ultimately benefiting your business in the long term."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: -  The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step in the process of fossil formation, as described, is the decomposition of the soft tissue. When an organism dies, its body begins to decompose due to various factors, such as exposure to the elements and the action of microorganisms. During this stage, the soft tissues of the organism, including its internal organs, muscles, and skin, gradually break down and decay. This process is facilitated by a combination of factors including bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that consume and break down the organic matter. As the soft tissues decompose, the more resilient parts of the organism, such as the bones, remain intact for a longer period. These bones are typically more durable due to their mineral composition and structure, which makes them resistant to immediate decay and able to withstand various environmental conditions. Once the soft tissue has decomposed, the next step in the process involves the scattering of the bones by external forces. Scavengers, such as carnivorous animals and birds, may feed on the carcass and move the bones elsewhere as they consume the remaining tissue. In addition, natural forces like wind and rain can also displace the bones, causing them to be scattered over a wider area. Eventually, this leads to the bones being buried by sand, soil, and other sediments, which is an essential step in the fossilization process. As time passes, the buried bones undergo further changes, such as the replacement of proteins with minerals dissolved in the surrounding soil. This process, known as permineralization, causes the bones to become infused with various minerals and gradually transform into a rock-like substance. The end result is a fossil, which is a preserved remnant of the original organism that has essentially turned to stone. Over time, the layers of soil and sediment that cover the fossil may be worn away through natural erosion caused by water and wind. This exposes the fossil, making its discovery possible by paleontologists and other researchers who study ancient life. In some cases, this process can take millions of years, as geological forces gradually reveal fossils that have been hidden deep within the Earth's crust. Upon discovery, these fossils provide valuable insights into the history of life on Earth, offering a glimpse into the biology, behavior, and ecology of extinct organisms."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Peachy tells Kipling the story of how he and his comrade-in-arms Daniel \\"Danny\\" Dravot (Sean Connery) traveled to remote Kafiristan (in modern-day Afghanistan, the province is now known as Nuristan), became \\"gods\\", and ultimately lost everything. Three years earlier. Dravot and Carnehan had met Kipling under less than auspicious circumstances; Carnehan, a former Colour sergeant of the Queen's Own Royal Loyal Light Infantry, pickpocketed Kiplings's pocketwatch but was forced to return it as he was a fellow Freemason. Carnehan claims to be an expert in \\"whiskey, women, waistcoats and bills of fare.\\" Both Dravot and Carnehan are in the process of blackmailing a local Rajah by posing as newspaper correspondents of \\"The Northern Star\\" newspaper-which outrages the real correspondent (Kipling). In order to save their lives Kipling has the local district commissioner detain both Dravot and Carnehan - who obliquely blackmail the commissioner himself. Despite being accomplished gun smugglers, swindlers, fencers of stolen goods, conmen, and blackmailers, both of them are bitter that after fighting to make India part of the Empire, they will have little to return home to except dead-end jobs.

The music isn't new, but the discovery that a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart \\"almost certainly\\" composed it is a stunning revelation. A researcher in Austria says the works were probably transcribed by Mozart's father, as young Mozart played. The two compositions -- a concerto in G and a prelude in G -- have long been in the files at the International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg, Austria, as anonymous works and were even published in the book \\"New Mozart Edition\\" in 1982. Now Ulrich Leisinger, director of the foundation's research department, believes the works actually were composed by Mozart before he was old enough to write music, and that Mozart's father, Leopold, transcribed them. The foundation said in a statement that Leisinger analyzed the handwriting and other \\"stylistic criteria\\" to determine the music was \\"almost certainly unknown compositions by\\" the young Mozart. The compositions were found in a book, compiled by Mozart's father, that was used for practice and the musical education of both Mozart and his sister, according to the statement. Leisinger's analyses \\"support the claim that they were actually composed by the young Mozart, who was not yet versed in musical notation, and transcribed by his father as the boy played the works at the keyboard,\\" the statement said. Jeffrey Kimpton, president of the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan, called the works \\"a remarkable historical find.\\" He said Leopold Mozart transcribed his son's early works as a way of preserving them. \\"When parents go to a piano recital of an early student, a young student, who's playing for the first time, they get a video tape, they get a DVD, that's a way of recording it,\\" Kimpton said. \\"I think what's exciting is that Mozart's father wanted to preserve this incredible genius. The young boy at this time didn't know how to write music, but he sure could play it. It's like a family photo or video album.\\" Finding such historical treasures is like detective work, Kimpton said. \\"You're kind of putting together a DNA picture,\\" he said. \\"This particular museum has hundreds of manuscripts. Over time as you learn more and more by various scholars working on this, you might turn the page and you may have looked at it a hundred times before but suddenly begin to see some things or understand some things that make some sense.\\" Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756 and started composing when he was 5 years old. By the time of his death in 1791, he had written more than 600 pieces of music.

Introduction: The movie starts by introducing Cady, a rough-and-tough rebellious young man from a low-income background, who, on one unfortunate night, gets involved in a bar brawl that ends up in a murder accusation. Despite proclaiming his innocence, Cady receives a long prison sentence. Every good plot requires an engaging starting point. Introducing Cady as a young man wrongfully convicted sets the stage for the viewer's empathy towards him, which is crucial for the plot to work. 2. Establishing the Problem: In prison, Cady faces injustice and corruption, which he cannot fight because he lacks the knowledge and power. He experiences first hand the inadequacies of the justice system and the disregard for human rights in prison. This part of the plot emphasizes the reason why Cady chooses to study law. It makes his decision seem like a logical and necessary step given the circumstances. 3. Main Plot - Studying Law: With the help of a compassionate jail librarian and an old prison inmate (a retired lawyer), Cady starts studying law. He meticulously learns the nuances of the legal world, transforming his illiteracy into knowledge. His keen interest in learning and the old lawyer's wisdom bring forth the powerful advocate in him. This transformation of the protagonist forms the crux of the plot and brings out the theme of the movie - empowerment through knowledge.  4. Rising Action - Cady's First Case: Cady soon discovers that some inmates are wrongly convicted, just like him. Using his newly acquired legal knowledge, he starts helping his fellow prisoners with their appeals. His first case - a man wrongfully accused of theft - is a nail-biting journey that ends in success.  This section drives the plot forward and gives Cady his first taste of legal success and confidence. 5. Climax - Cady's Fight for Freedom: Using the old lawyer's guidance, Cady embarks on the mission to uncover the truth about the murder he was accused of. Unraveling old reports, finding lost evidence, and tracing witnesses, he stages an impactful appeal in court for his own case.  The climax involves high-stakes drama where the protagonist fights for his own freedom. 6. Conclusion - Victory and Resolution: After a tense and emotional court hearing, Cady wins his appeal, proving his innocence, and is set free. On his release, he dedicates himself to helping other wrongly accused prisoners. The plot concludes with a sense of victorious satisfaction, ultimately rewarding the protagonist's efforts and persistence. 7. Ending Message: The movie ends by showing Cady becoming a successful advocate fighting injustices, thus forwarding the message - wrongfully imprisoned, but rightfully knowledgeable, and freedom prevails. This gives viewers a sense of redemption and validates the effectiveness of Cady's struggles, providing the movie with a satisfying and meaningful conclusion.  In this way, the plot emphasizes the importance of knowledge as a tool that can be used not just for self-upliftment, but also to fight against systemic injustices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The second type, which is very similar to top roping, is called lead climbing. In both of the types, the climber can sit off the wall and rest on the rope. The third type is called bouldering. Bouldering is a type of free climbing without any ropes. This is the most demanding of all climbing types. The climber must be able to complete the climbing without taking a rest on the rope. Believe it or not, climbing is said to be about 75% legs and only 25% arms. To climb efficiently and successfully, a person needs to have a wonderful technique.

They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\".  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.  As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones., what would be the answer ?","output":"The answer to the question would be: The Catacombs of Rome show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs. Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram, and later, narrative religious scenes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the soul with God through the intellect.\\" answer the question \\"For the Pasupatas, how was the union of the soul with God achieved?\\" Options: --yes --no","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the soul with God through the intellect\\" does answer the question \\"For the Pasupatas, how was the union of the soul with God achieved?\\" The Pāśupata sect was one of the oldest and most significant Hindu Shaivite sects that existed around the 2nd century CE. As an influential group, their core teachings centered around the relationship between the individual soul (Pashu) and Lord Shiva (Pati), the supreme God. The Pasupatas emphasized the significance of spiritual enlightenment and salvation (Moksha) according to their tenets. The primary goal of a Pāśupata follower was to attain Moksha or liberation from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (Samsara). Moksha could only be achieved through the realization of the soul's unity with God. As the given sentence states, this union is accomplished through the intellect. In the Pāśupata tradition, the intellect, or the ability to reason and acquire a deep understanding of spiritual concepts, is emphasized as the key to spiritual growth. They believed that the practice of asceticism, yoga, and meditation exercises, combined with studying sacred Hindu texts, like the Vedas and Agamas, would create a strong foundation for the intellect to grasp the true nature of reality. The Pāśupata sect also focused on the importance of devotion and surrender to Lord Shiva as the primary means of achieving spiritual progress and ultimately union with God. When a follower successfully combines the sharpening of the intellect with intense devotion, the union of the soul with God is reached, leading to ultimate liberation. In conclusion, the sentence effectively answers the question by communicating that the Pāśupata sect believed union with God is achieved through intellectual development and spiritual realization. This understanding served as the foundation for the spiritual journey in the Pāśupata tradition, leading to the attainment of Moksha."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period.

Bloomberg reports that Keith Schiller, the director of Oval Office operations, has told numerous people that he plans to leave the White House at the end of September or the beginning of October. Schiller, a former NYPD detective who began working for Trump in 1999 as a part-time bodyguard, is leaving to take a higher-paying job. Schiller currently makes 165,000, down from the 294,000 he made last year from his work with the Trump Organization, the Trump presidential campaign, and his private security firm, KS Global Group. On May 9, Trump sent Schiller to FBI headquarters to deliver the letter firing Comey, an incident that prompted Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. At the time, CNN reported that a former White House aide called Schiller, who became Trump's head of security in 2005, the \\"most underestimated person on Trump's team.\\" If Schiller does leave, only two former Trump Organization employees will remain in the White House, Communications Director Hope Hick and Social Media Director Dan Scavino, CNN reports.

As the director of Oval Office operations, Schiller has been at the helm of the president's security apparatus. His imminent departure, as reported by Bloomberg, is expected to happen by the end of September or early October, and comes at a critical juncture for the Trump administration. Schiller, a former NYPD detective, began his career with Trump in 1999 as a part-time bodyguard, and his departure marks the end of an era in the president's inner circle. Sources confirm that Schiller plans to take up a higher-paying job, citing a substantial reduction in his salary as one of the reasons. He currently earns 165,000, a marked decrease from the 294,000 he made last year from his work with the Trump Organization, the Trump presidential campaign, and his private security firm, KS Global Group. Given Schiller's long-standing relationship with Trump, his exit is bound to leave a void in the president's close-knit team. Schiller shot to notoriety on May 9, when Trump tasked him with delivering the dismissal letter to FBI headquarters, a move that ultimately led to former FBI Director Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Schiller's pivotal role in the incident was underscored by a former White House aide who, at the time, described him to CNN as the \\"most underestimated person on Trump's team.\\" As Trump's head of security since 2005, Schiller has been a crucial part of the president's team, known for his loyalty and dedication. If Schiller does leave the White House, only two former Trump Organization employees will remain: Communications Director Hope Hicks and Social Media Director Dan Scavino. Schiller's departure will significantly alter the composition of Trump's core team, possibly leading to further internal reshuffles in the administration. Despite these reports, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has insisted that Schiller's planned departure is \\"not true.\\" Yet, with multiple sources confirming his intention to leave, it appears that Trump's White House must brace itself for the end of an era. Schiller's experience, loyalty, and deep understanding of the president's working style will undoubtedly be sorely missed as the administration navigates an increasingly challenging political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Juventus is one of Italy's most successful and popular football clubs, boasting numerous achievements and titles in various national and international competitions.

Here is an article: U.S. first lady Michelle Obama announces the winner of the best picture Oscar via video link at the 85th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Calif., on Feb. 24, 2013. There weren’t too many surprises from last night’s Oscars show, but there was one moment in the ceremony that was truly unexpected: although Jack Nicholson took the stage to announce the Best Picture winner—Argo, in case you missed it—he didn’t share the results. In fact, it was Michelle Obama, appearing via a live satellite feed, who opened the all-important envelope. The First Lady’s involvement was kept secret up until the last moment — she wasn’t even included on the show production schedule, reports Deadline. The White House’s official statement on the event said that the First Lady, a big movie fan, was excited to take part in the presenting of such a significant honor. The idea to do the announcement via satellite came from Harvey Weinstein’s daughter Lily Weinstein, says Roger Friedman at ShowBiz411, after it became clear that there was no way the First Lady would make it to Los Angeles for the event; Sunday night was also the evening of the National Governors Association Dinner at the White House. Many thing could have gone wrong in this complicated plan, but the show’s producers had a Plan B, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Although the chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers was in Washington to hand the Argo envelope to the First Lady—yes, even Michelle Obama has to find out the winner’s identity along with the viewers at home—there was a back-up envelope in a key location: as you can see in the video below, it was in Jack Nicholson’s hand.

Question: Lawrence and Adam both wake up to find what in their pockets? Title: Saw Movie plot: A young man, David (Whannell), is in an interrogation room talking to an unnamed, unsympathetic police officer (Paul Moder). David is in handcuffs, and he has blood on his face and shirt. He is smoking a cigarette. He tells the officer that after he finished his work as an orderly at the hospital, he was knocked unconscious and taken to a large room. Inside the room, David was strapped to a chair with a large, rusty metal device locked onto his head. To his left was a small television, which began playing a video showing a frightening puppet that tells him that the device on his head is a \\"reverse beartrap\\", which is hooked into his jaws and will pry his face open with great force if he does not unlock it in time. The puppet tells David that the only key to unlock the device is in the stomach of his dead cellmate (Dean Francis). David is able to break free of his bonds, but by doing so he sets off a timer on the back of the device. Across the room, he finds the body that the puppet mentioned, but also finds that the man is actually alive but under paralysis. David panics and stabs his cellmate before starting to look for the key. He slices into the man's stomach and after finding the key, David unlocks the device and throws it to the ground, just as it snaps open. David begins screaming and weeping in horror. At the entrance to the room, the puppet from the video appears on a tricycle. He congratulates David on surviving, and tells him that he has proven he is no longer ungrateful for being alive. The movie ends with the police officer asking \\"Are you grateful, David?\\" causing the young man to again break down. As the end credits begin to roll, a CGI replica of the bathroom used later in the full Saw film is shown, although with some differences. A small peephole is shown with an eye visible behind it, which was a concept reused in another trap in Saw.[2] The answer to this question is:","output":"Can't answer"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In an upscale New York City mansion, wealthy and popular teenager Kathryn Merteuil is discussing her prep school with Mrs. Caldwell and Mrs. Caldwell's daughter, Cecile. Kathryn promises Mrs. Caldwell that she will look out for the naive Cecile. Kathryn's stepbrother, Sebastian Valmont, enters the room, whereupon Mrs. Caldwell reacts to him coldly and leaves with Cecile.  Kathryn reveals to Sebastian that her real intention is to use Cecile to take revenge on her ex-lover Court Reynolds, who dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn asks Sebastian to seduce Cecile, thereby rendering her a \\"tramp\\" and spoiling her in Court's eyes.  Sebastian refuses as he is planning to seduce Annette Hargrove, the virgin daughter of their prep school's new headmaster who published an essay in support of chastity until marriage. After some negotiation, the two step-siblings agree on a wager: If Sebastian fails to bed Annette, Kathryn gets Sebastian's vintage Jaguar XK140; if he succeeds, Kathryn will have sex with him, as Kathryn is the one girl Sebastian has failed to bed.  Sebastian's first attempt to seduce Annette fails, as she had already been told of his bad reputation. He vents to his gay friend, Blaine Tuttle, who suggests that the informant might be Annette's ex-boyfriend and closeted jock, Greg McConnell. Sebastian bribes Blaine to seduce Greg, while secretly filming their meeting. Sebastian then threatens Greg with the photographs, but the latter denies warning Annette. Greg is then ordered by Sebastian into both identifying the true informant, and presenting Sebastian in a good light to Annette.

Hypothesis: There is an organized tour of the building available. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The statement given in the premise describes that the fine Art-Deco features, such as murals and gold-leaf ceiling frescoes, are visible during an organized tour. By mentioning the existence of an organized tour in the premise, it inherently implies that there is indeed an organized tour available for the building. Additionally, the presence of such intricate and historical features suggests that the building could be of significant importance or value, which reinforces the likelihood of an organized tour being available for interested individuals. Organized tours are often intended to showcase architectural, historical, or artistic elements of a building or area, and therefore would be a plausible method for visitors to explore and appreciate the Art-Deco features mentioned in the premise. Furthermore, the use of the word \\"can\\" in the premise indicates the possibility and availability of these features to be seen on an organized tour. This implies that the organized tour is an existing option for those who wish to observe and experience the building's fine Art-Deco features. Thus, the premise entails that there is, in fact, an organized tour available for the building in question. In conclusion, the premise, which states that the building's Art-Deco features can be viewed during an organized tour, entails the hypothesis that an organized tour of the building is available. This is because the description of the features being visible on a tour inherently implies the existence of such a tour. In showcasing these artistic and architectural details, organized tours provide an opportunity for visitors to appreciate the value and history behind such a remarkable building, and therefore further supports the availability of an organized tour as described in the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Paragraph: To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

What are the pros and cons of learning C++ as a first programming language? What are the pros and cons of learning C# as a first programming language? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"I will first list out the pros and cons of learning C++ as a first programming language, and then I will do the same for C#. Lastly, I will address if these two questions are the same. Pros of learning C++ as a first programming language: 1. Foundation: Learning C++ provides a solid foundation in programming, as it teaches the fundamentals of computer memory management, pointers, and object-oriented programming. 2. Performance: C++ enables programmers to write high-performance code and is widely used in performance-critical applications, such as game development and low-level system programming. 3. Job opportunities: C++ is used in various industries, leading to numerous job opportunities for skilled developers. 4. Transferable skills: Learning C++ makes it easier to pick up other programming languages, like C, Java, and C#. Cons of learning C++ as a first programming language: 1. Complexity: C++ is a complex language with many features, which can be overwhelming for beginners. 2. Limited library support: C++ lacks built-in library support for tasks like text processing and networking compared to other languages like Python or Java. 3. Steeper learning curve: Managing memory manually and dealing with pointers can be challenging for beginners, leading to a steeper learning curve. 4. Less forgiving: C++ is less forgiving with syntax and memory management errors, which may frustrate new programmers. Pros of learning C# as a first programming language: 1. Easy learning curve: C# has a less steep learning curve as it abstracts away low-level details, making it easier for beginners. 2. Versatility: C# is versatile and can be used for various tasks, including web, mobile, and game development. 3. Extensive libraries: C# has extensive built-in libraries, making it easier to accomplish tasks without reinventing the wheel. 4. Strong community: C# has a strong and active community, ensuring ample resources and support for beginners. Cons of learning C# as a first programming language: 1. Platform dependence: C# is designed for the Microsoft ecosystem and may have some limitations when working with non-Microsoft platforms. 2. Less exposure to low-level details: While C# abstracts away low-level details, this can also mean that learners won't gain as much insight into how a computer's memory works and other core programming concepts compared to learning C++. 3. Performance: C# may exhibit slightly lower performance compared to languages like C++ for certain performance-critical applications. Comparing the two questions: Although both questions deal with the pros and cons of learning a specific programming language, they are not the same. Each question addresses a different language (C++ and C#), and each language offers its unique advantages and disadvantages as a first programming language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The Leleges were one of the aboriginal peoples of the Aegean littoral, distinct from the Pelasgians, the Bronze Age Greeks, the Cretan Minoans, the Cycladic Telkhines, and the Tyrrhenians. The classical Hellenes emerged as an amalgam of these six peoples. The distinction between the Leleges and the Carians (a nation living in south west Anatolia) is unclear. According to Homer, the Leleges were a distinct Anatolian tribe; However, Herodotus states that \\"Leleges\\" had been an early name for the Carians. The fourth-century BCE historian Philippus of Theangela, suggested that the Leleges maintained connections to Messenia, Laconia, Locris and other regions in mainland Greece, after they were overcome by the Carians in Asia Minor.  - A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal and largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government.  - Mausolus was a ruler of Caria (377353 BC), nominally the Persian Satrap, who enjoyed the status of king or dynast by virtue of the powerful position created by his father Hecatomnus who had succeeded the assassinated Persian Satrap Tissaphernes in the Carian satrapy and founded the hereditary dynasty of the Hecatomnids.  - Ada of Caria ( Ancient Greek :  ) ( fl . 377 -- 326 BC ) was a member of the House of Hecatomnus ( the Hecatomnids ) and ruler of Caria in the 4th century BC , first as Persian Satrap and later as Queen under the auspices of Alexander III ( the Great ) of Macedon . Ada was the daughter of Hecatomnus , satrap of Caria , and sister of Mausolus , Artemisia , Idrieus , and Pixodarus . She was married to her brother Idrieus , who succeeded Artemisia in 351 BC and died in 344 BC. On the death of her husband Ada became satrap of Caria , but was expelled by her brother Pixodarus in 340 BC. Ada fled to the fortress of Alinda , where she maintained her rule in exile . When Alexander the Great entered Caria in 334 BC , Ada adopted Alexander as her son and surrendered Alinda to him . In return , Alexander accepted the offer and gave Ada formal command of the Siege of Halicarnassus . After the fall of Halicarnassus , Alexander returned Alinda and made Ada queen of the whole of Caria . Ada 's popularity with the populace in turn ensured the Carians ' loyalty to Alexander . According to Turkish archaeologists , the tomb of Ada has been discovered , although this claim remains unresolved . Her remains are on display in the archaeological museum of Bodrum .  - The Hecatomnid dynasty or Hecatomnids were the rulers of Caria and surrounding areas from about 395334 BCE. They were nominally satraps (governors) under the Persian Achaeminid Empire, but ruled with considerable autonomy, and established a hereditary dynasty. The dynasty was founded by Hecatomnus and originally had its seat in Mylasa; Mausolus moved it to Halicarnassus.  - Satraps (Old Persian: xšarapwn) were the governors of the provinces of the ancient Median and Achaemenid (Persian) Empires and in several of their successors, such as the Sasanian Empire and the Hellenistic empires.  - Mycale. also Mykale and Mykali, called Samsun Da and Dilek Da (Dilek Peninsula) in modern Turkey, is a mountain on the west coast of central Anatolia in Turkey, north of the mouth of the Maeander and divided from the Greek island of Samos by the 1.6 km wide Mycale Strait. The mountain forms a ridge, terminating in what was known anciently as the Trogilium promontory (Ancient Greek  or ). There are several beaches on the north shore ranging from sand to pebbles. The south flank is mainly escarpment.  - A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.  - The Old Persian language is one of the two directly attested Old Iranian languages (the other being Avestan). Old Persian appears primarily in the inscriptions, clay tablets, and seals of the Achaemenid era (c. 600 BCE to 300 BCE). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now present-day Iran, Romania (Gherla), Armenia, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt, the most important attestation by far being the contents of the Behistun Inscription (dated to 525 BCE). Recent research into the vast Persepolis Fortification Archive at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago have unearthed Old Persian tablets (2007). This new text shows that the Old Persian language was a written language in use for practical recording and not only for royal display.  - The Sasanian Empire (or ), also known as Sassanian, Sasanid, Sassanid or Neo-Persian Empire), known to its inhabitants as rnshahr in Middle Persian, was the last imperial dynasty in Persia (Iran) before the rise of Islam, ruled by and named after the Sasanian dynasty from 224 to 651 AD. The Sasanian Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighboring arch-rival the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years.  - Caria (from Luwian: \\"Karuwa\\", \\"steep country\\"; Ancient Greek: , \\"Karia\\") was a region of western Anatolia extending along the coast from mid-Ionia (Mycale) south to Lycia and east to Phrygia. The Ionian and Dorian Greeks colonized the west of it and joined the Carian population in forming Greek-dominated states there. The inhabitants of Caria, known as Carians, had arrived there before the Greeks. They were described by Herodotos as being of Minoan descent, while the Carians themselves maintained that they were Anatolian mainlanders intensely engaged in seafaring and were akin to the Mysians and the Lydians. The Carians did speak an Anatolian language, known as Carian, which does not necessarily reflect their geographic origin, as Anatolian once may have been widespread. Also closely associated with the Carians were the Leleges, which could be an earlier name for Carians or for a people who had preceded them in the region and continued to exist as part of their society in a reputedly second-class status.  - Hecatomnus of Mylasa or Hekatomnos was an early 4th-century BC ruler of Caria. He was the satrap (governor) of Caria for the Persian Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II (404358 BC). However, the basis for Hecatomnus' political power was twofold: he was both a high appointed Persian official and a powerful local dynast, who founded the hereditary dynasty of the Hecatomnids.    What is the relationship between 'ada of caria' and 'sovereign'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Ada of Caria was a member of the House of Hecatomnus (the Hecatomnids) and ruler of Caria in the 4th century BC. While she was not a sovereign ruler in the strictest sense, she did hold significant power and influence in her region, serving first as a Persian Satrap and later as Queen under the auspices of Alexander III (the Great) of Macedon. As a Persian Satrap, Ada was essentially a governor appointed by the Persian Achaemenid Empire to rule Caria on behalf of the Persian king. This position allowed her a certain degree of autonomy and authority, but she was ultimately answerable to the Persian Empire. However, when Ada was expelled from her position as satrap by her brother Pixodarus and later sought refuge with Alexander the Great, her relationship to sovereignty changed. Alexander the Great accepted Ada's offer to adopt him as her son and placed her back in power as the Queen of Caria. In this role, she effectively ruled the region under the protection and authority of Alexander the Great, who was a sovereign ruler. Thus, Ada of Caria, as a satrap and later as a queen under Alexander the Great, held significant power and authority in her region, but her status as a sovereign was always subject to the greater power of either the Persian Empire or Alexander the Great. The concept of sovereignty here is relative, as Ada's power and autonomy were ultimately dependent on the rulers and empires to which she was affiliated. This demonstrates that in the historical context of ancient kingdoms and empires, the relationship between rulers like Ada of Caria and sovereignty was complex and nuanced."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How did the Pirates end the season?\\"  Context: \\"In 1969 the Cubs, managed by Leo Durocher, built a substantial lead in the newly created National League Eastern Division by mid-August. Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.

During the season, they played a crucial role in shaking the first-place Chicago Cubs' confidence, contributing to the Cubs' eight-game losing streak in September. At the time, the Cubs were competing with the New York Mets for the division lead. The Pirates' resurgence, including a 7-5 extra-innings victory over the Cubs, helped pave the way for the Mets to eventually pull ahead and secure the division title. The Mets would go on to win the 1969 World Series, while the Pirates ended the season without securing a playoff spot."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Treenailed boats were use used by viking in which centuries?

Options: - compare prices - spending of money - have fun - splurge - purchasing  The answer is \\"compare prices\\" because Answer:","output":"People evaluate what to buy at a shop using a variety of factors, and one of the most important factors is comparing the prices of different products. The process of comparing prices is essential for several reasons that have major impacts on customers and their shopping experience. Firstly, comparing prices allows consumers to make informed decisions when purchasing items. By evaluating the prices of different products, customers can weigh the pros and cons, ultimately selecting the item that offers the best value for money. This is particularly important in a competitive marketplace where similar products can have sizeable price differences. Comparing prices helps customers to navigate through these disparities and select the product that suits their budget and requirements. Secondly, comparing prices effectively helps customers to save money. By identifying the best-priced item, consumers can optimize their spending, ensuring they can purchase more or allocate the savings to other areas of their lives. In an era of price-conscious shopping, consumers are increasingly drawn towards deals, discounts, and promotions, making price comparison a vital factor in navigating the purchasing power. Moreover, comparing prices can be a reflection of product quality. In some instances, the price of a product is directly related to its quality or brand reputation. More expensive items may use higher quality materials or components, whereas cheaper alternatives may be less durable, have lower performance or be produced by lesser-known brands or manufacturers. In this context, price comparison promotes informed decision-making, allowing customers to balance product quality and price while avoiding the potential pitfalls of purchasing based solely on cost. Additionally, comparing prices contributes to the creation of a competitive marketplace. When businesses recognize that customers are comparing their prices to those of other companies, it encourages them to offer better deals, higher quality products, and improved customer service to remain competitive. Ultimately, price comparison benefits both consumers and businesses, ensuring the marketplace remains dynamic and consumer-focused. Furthermore, comparing prices helps customers identify any potential fraudulent activity, price-gouging, or overcharging for a particular product. By being aware of the average price of a product or similar products, consumers can be vigilant, reporting any unethical practices, and choosing to buy from a different store or brand. Finally, comparing prices can be a simple and enjoyable way to shop for some customers. The process of hunting for the best deal or bargain can be a fun and satisfying challenge. Exchange platforms and price comparison websites have been developed to cater to this demand, streamlining the process and making it more accessible than ever before. In conclusion, the answer is \\"compare prices,\\" as this method allows customers to make informed decisions, save money, ensure product quality and value, promote a competitive market, identify unethical pricing practices, and even make the shopping experience fun. By comparing prices, consumers have a greater sense of control and empowerment in their purchasing decisions, ultimately benefiting the entirety of the marketplace."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There were happy little pepperoni smiling up at me, and the cheese was sooo gooey and delicious. It was like eating a pizza made of dreams. While I was eating, I noticed that the place looked very clean, like Cinderella's castle or even my own super spiffy bedroom. Everyone was smiling and laughing with each other, all happy to be there. After finishing the pizza, it was time for dessert. I got the “Rainbow Surprise” and ooh, it was so colorful and sparkly – just like a unicorn's treasure! The ice cream tasted like a sweet, yummy cloud that melted in my mouth. Pure magic! To end this amazing fairy tale, I'd give Yummy Tummy a big round of applause and five shiny gold stars.

A:","output":"To solve this math problem, follow these simple steps: 1. Understand the task: The task is asking you to find a two-digit number based on two given conditions:    a. The sum of the digits in the number is 11.    b. The difference between the digits is 5. 2. Set up the equations: Let's assign variables to the digits in the two-digit number to make solving the problem easier. We can call the tens digit 'x' and the ones digit 'y'.    Now, we can write two equations to represent the given conditions:    a. x + y = 11 (sum of the digits is 11)    b. x - y = 5 (difference of the digits is 5) 3. Solve the equations: We need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 'x' and 'y.' We can use either substitution or elimination method. In this case, let's use the substitution method.    a. Solve the first equation for one of the variables (let's choose 'x'):        x = 11 - y    b. Substitute this expression for 'x' into the second equation:       (11 - y) - y = 5    c. Solve for 'y':       11 - 2y = 5       -2y = -6       y = 3    d. Substitute this value of 'y' back into the equation we found in step 3a to find the value of 'x':       x = 11 - 3       x = 8 4. Final answer: So, the tens digit 'x' is 8, and the ones digit 'y' is 3. Therefore, the two-digit number we're looking for is 83."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can teach animals how to behave?\\" is \\"humans\\", given that  exercise can teach animals how to behave?","output":"The right answer to the question \\"what can teach animals how to behave?\\" is not simply \\"humans\\" or \\"exercise\\", as it is a multifaceted concept that encompasses a diverse range of factors. While humans certainly play a vital role in teaching animals how to behave, especially in domesticated settings and controlled environments such as zoos and sanctuaries, other factors, including exercise, also contribute significantly to the shaping of animal behavior. First, let's consider the role humans play in teaching animals how to behave. In cases of domesticated animals like dogs, horses, or parrots, humans are crucial in shaping their behaviors as they grow up. Through various training techniques, like positive reinforcement, clicker training, or classical conditioning, humans are able to mold animals to adapt to human environments, exhibit desirable behaviors, and avoid or minimize undesirable ones. Many animals, like dogs and parrots, have evolved with humans and have strong predispositions to bond and learn from us. In captivity, many wild animals also learn behaviors from humans, both intentionally, through training, and unintentionally, through observation and interaction. Another factor that influences animal behavior is exercise. Much like humans, regular exercise plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of animals. For animals in captivity or domesticated settings, it is especially important to provide them with adequate opportunities for exercise to ensure their physical health and mental well-being. Exercise alone might not directly \\"teach\\" animals how to behave, but it has multiple benefits that can impact their behavior, including: 1. Reducing anxiety and stress: Regular exercise can help to lower stress levels in animals and make them more mentally receptive to learning. Stressed animals are less likely to learn new behaviors or be able to generalize them over time. As a result, exercise is essential for fostering a supportive environment that aids the learning process. 2. Building confidence and trust: Exercise, particularly when engaging in activities that build upon animals' innate skills and abilities, helps to increase their self-assurance. This confidence is essential when teaching animals to perform new tasks or exhibit acceptable behaviors consistently. 3. Enhancing mental stimulation: Just like humans, animals require mental stimulation. Exercise not only benefits their physical health but stimulates their cognitive processes as well. This stimulation leads to animals being more apt to learn new behaviors and follow instructions. 4. Establishing routines and structure: A structured exercise regimen can help provide a sense of routine for animals. This structure can aid in teaching animals about boundaries, expectations, and appropriate behaviors, making them more amenable to training and instruction. In addition to the human involvement and exercise, other factors like animals' innate abilities, social learning from other animals, and environmental adaptations also play an essential role in shaping their behavior. In conclusion, while humans undeniably play a significant role in teaching animals how to behave, it is crucial to acknowledge that exercise, as well as other factors, contribute to the molding of animal behavior. Animal training and behavior modification is a complex process involving not just a single factor, but rather a multitude of elements that, together, determine an animal's behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet. The next day I couldn’t apply any pressure and couldn’t walk at all. I was dirty and smelly and needed some serious help on my leg but I was too far from any civilization.

Continue writing the following text. The star that was visible from the house was brighter than the light from the moon. The","output":"night sky seemed to have been painted with a stroke of perfection, where each celestial body had been meticulously placed to create a mesmerizing view for anyone gazing at it. Though countless stars adorned this beautiful canvas, this particularly striking star seemed to call out for attention more than the others. Unbeknownst to many, this was not an ordinary star at all – it was a phenomenon that would unravel the mysteries of the universe and bring forth a new understanding of the cosmos. As twilight gave way to darkness, the star's luminance intensified, and it seemingly appeared to be closer to the earth than before. The gentle shimmer of the aurora surrounding it made it seem otherworldly. The residents of the house, fascinated by this once-in-a-lifetime spectacle, stood with their eyes fixated on the sky, not wanting to miss a single moment of this cosmic dance. Over the next few weeks, the star continued to cast an incandescent glow far beyond its celestial counterparts. Its brilliance swiftly seized the attention of astronomers around the world, who had embarked on a quest to comprehend the peculiarities of this celestial wonder. Soon enough, telescopes were angled towards the star, as eager scientists meticulously recorded observations and collected data to decipher the star's perplexing behavior. As the scientific community pieced together the clues, they eventually discovered that this was not a star in the conventional sense. In reality, it was an astronomical event of immense proportions – a galactic collision between two distant star systems. The sheer force of the cataclysm sent ripples through the cosmos, with waves of cosmic energy cascading forth from the epicenter. These cosmic waves washed over the earth, enveloping the planet in an ethereal veil. This ethereal energy had a peculiar effect on the earth's inhabitants; the emotions of hope, harmony, and love surged through the collective consciousness, emotions so powerful that even the most hardened of hearts couldn't resist its relentless pull. The energy seemed to weave a web of interconnectedness amongst all living beings and fueled a new-found appreciation for the intangible connections coursing through the veins of humanity. As the days passed, the elegance of this celestial ballet continued to dominate the sky. The star's steady transition through a kaleidoscope of colors became a testament of nature's capability to create and destroy on a grand scale. In witnessing this spectacular display, humans collectively stood in awe of the star's cyclical transformation, as it seemed to embody the essence of life itself. Time continued to pass, and as the galactic collision gradually waned in intensity, so too did the brightness of the star. As the star began to fade away, the profound sense of wonder it had imparted upon those who beheld it seemed to only grow stronger. The memories of the star served as a poignant reminder not only of the interconnectedness of life but also of the staggering beauty that could manifest amidst the most chaotic of processes. For generations to come, people would share the story of the star that once burned brighter than the light from the moon – a star that illuminated the night sky and opened the eyes of humankind to their place in the cosmos. They would recount how it changed their perspective on the universe, and ultimately, their perspective on themselves. And as those who bore witness to the celestial event retold their experiences, the legend of the star would endure, inspiring dreamers and visionaries to look to the sky with the hope that one day they might unravel the mysteries of the stars and unlock the secrets of the universe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At least 2,400 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the outbreak has been concentrated, Chan said. Cases have also been reported in nearby Nigeria and Senegal. The foundation says the money will be used to enable international aid organizations and national governments \\"to purchase badly needed supplies and scale up emergency operations in affected countries.\\" This is considered the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. The World Health Organization said Monday the rapid spread of the virus in Liberia shows no sign of slowing. \\"The number of new cases is increasing exponentially,\\" the WHO said, calling the situation a \\"dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions of human suffering.\\" Taxis packed with families who fear they've contracted the deadly virus crisscross the Liberian capital, searching for a place where they can be treated, the WHO said. \\"As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened, it immediately fills to overflowing with patients,\\" the U.N. group said. To help ease some of the burden on West Africa's already overtaxed medical system, the United States announced Tuesday it will send 10 million in additional funds. That's in addition to the 100 million Washington has already sent to help fight the outbreak. USAID also announced it will make 75 million in extra funds available. The new funds will pay for transportation and support to send 100 more health care workers to help fight the epidemic. The WHO and several nonprofit agencies on the ground have repeatedly called for the international community to send additional trained help. USAID funding has already provided 130,000 sets of personal protective equipment, 50,000 hygiene kits and 1,000 new beds. USAID has created a website where trained nurses, physician assistants and doctors who want to help can sign up.

But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Teenagers are often a difficult group. With all those hormones  flooding their bodies, they can be moody, unpredictable, and tend to make uncertain choices. But however confusing their teenage years are, kids can still be generally happy, depending on their lifestyle choices. According to a new research by British scientists, teens who don't smoke, drink only moderately or not at all, and who don't eat much junk food are likely to be happier than other teens. The study looked at 40,000 British families and came up with some interesting findings. For example, kids who never drank alcohol were up to six times more likely to report higher levels of happiness than kids who drank. And teens who smoked were five times less likely to rate high on happiness charts compared to kids who don't smoke. Same goes for diet and physical activity. The more fruits and vegetables kids eat, and the more hours they spend playing sports, the happier they are. Now, of course this doesn't mean that not smoking or drinking, and playing sports guarantees happiness. It could be that kids who have happy character tend to be more active and less addicted to drinking or smoking. And it could equally be the case that kids who are unhappy are more related to drinking and smoking and eating junk food. Other studies have shown that exercise is a proven way to treat anxiety and depression. Future studies may support the idea that other healthful behaviors, including refraining  from smoking, drinking, and eating too much junk, can avoid sadness and increase happiness, too. A:","output":"Based on the article, which of the following factors is associated with higher levels of happiness among teenagers? A) Frequently consuming junk food and drinking alcohol B) Not smoking, moderate or no alcohol consumption, and limited junk food intake C) Minimal involvement in physical activities and sports D) High levels of alcohol consumption and smoking Correct answer: B) Not smoking, moderate or no alcohol consumption, and limited junk food intake. The article states that teenagers who don't smoke, drink only moderately or not at all, and who don't eat much junk food are likely to be happier than other teens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He took very little clothing when he went missing, and there is evidence that he never left Lakeland. Foul play is suspected in his case, which remains unsolved. ||||| PASCO COUNTY, Fla. - Mark Duane Woodard went missing in 1975. His family finally received much needed answers Wednesday night.      Over the last 41 years, Diann Wells has never stopped wanting to find her brother alive.      “You always kind of hope it sometimes, sometimes you accept that he’s gone, and you know, but every once in a while, it just sneaks in there,” she said.      Mark Duane Woodard was 19 when he went missing on April 14, 1975. Investigators say the teen left that day for a cross-country trip with a friend to pick up marijuana in Texas.      Diann and her family never saw him again.      “I had worries about when he left whether he’d be ok or not,” said Wells.      Two years after his disappearance, remains were found in a wooded area in Marion County -- long before DNA testing would become the norm. In 2009, staff at the University of North Texas crime lab ran DNA analysis and added their findings to their missing persons data base.      “About seven or eight years ago, they found a skeleton,” said Wells.      She said her parents submitted DNA samples for that discovery.      “They thought maybe it was him, the size was about right,” she said.      Sadly the samples did not match.      In 2015, while reviewing the Woodard case, Pasco investigators decided to send the previously obtained DNA samples to the University of North Texas, presumably just to cross-check their data.      On Friday, just before the holiday weekend, investigators delivered the news to Wells. They’d matched the samples to the remains found in 1977.      “When they told me I was just, like, shocked... Completely shocked,” said Wells.      And while she’s devastated to learn her brother isn’t alive, she’s relieved to finally have some answers. She said she’s planning a memorial and hopes one day someone will pay for what happened.      ----- |||||Summary:","output":"Mark Duane Woodard, who disappeared in 1975 at the age of 19, was identified by investigators in 2021 after DNA samples matched with remains found in 1977.

Investigations into his case revealed that he never left Lakeland and foul play was suspected. Two years after his disappearance, unidentified remains were found in a wooded area. However, DNA testing was not standard at the time. It was only in 2009 that crime scientists at the University of North Texas conducted a DNA analysis and included their findings in their missing persons database.

Possible A: generous, stupid, different, tall, silly  Why is \\"different\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Different\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it accurately reflects the nature of the United States as a melting pot. The term \\"melting pot\\" refers to the blending of various cultures, ethnicities, and backgrounds that has historically occurred in the United States. This is due to immigration, cultural exchange, and the nation's foundation on principles of diversity and acceptance. In this context, when people say America is a melting pot, it is because the people are all \\"different\\" in terms of their cultural, ethnic, and personal backgrounds. This variety creates a diverse society, where people of various backgrounds coexist, learn from one another, and contribute to a shared cultural identity. On the other hand, the other possible answers (generous, stupid, tall, silly) do not align with the concept of a melting pot, as they do not accurately describe the diversity and multicultural nature of the United States.

While the core meaning of \\"thing\\" is consistent in both cases, the exact nature and implications differ based on the context and subject matter. In the first sentence, \\"She has a thing about him,\\" the term \\"thing\\" is used to suggest that she has a special liking, attraction, or possibly an infatuation for this person. It implies that her feelings may not be fully understandable or rational, and that there is something unique about her relationship or connection to him. This usage usually pertains to romantic or emotional interests. In the second sentence, \\"He has a thing about seafood,\\" the term \\"thing\\" is employed to state that he has a strong preference, aversion, or preoccupation with seafood. This could mean that he particularly enjoys or dislikes seafood or that he has a particular interest or curiosity surrounding it.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Parts of a Neuron As you learned in the first section, the main part of a neuron is the cell body, which is also known as the soma (soma = “body”). The cell body contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles. But what makes neurons special is that they have many extensions of their cell membranes, which are generally referred to as processes. Neurons are usually described as having one, and only one, axon—a fiber that emerges from the cell body and projects to target cells. That single axon can branch repeatedly to communicate with many target cells. It is the axon that propagates the nerve impulse, which is communicated to one or more cells. The other processes of the neuron are dendrites, which receive information from other neurons at specialized areas of contact called synapses. The dendrites are usually highly branched processes, providing locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body. Information flows through a neuron from the dendrites, across the cell body, and down the axon. This gives the neuron a polarity—meaning that information flows in this one direction. Figure 12.8 shows the relationship of these parts to one another.   Q: Which part of a neuron contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles?

Information:  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - The noisy miner (\\"Manorina melanocephala\\") is a bird in the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae, and is endemic to eastern and south-eastern Australia. This miner is a grey bird, with a black head, orange-yellow beak and feet, a distinctive yellow patch behind the eye and white tips on the tail feathers. The Tasmanian race has a more intense yellow panel in the wing, and a broader white tip to the tail. Males, females and juveniles are similar in appearance, though young birds are a brownish-grey. As the common name suggests, the noisy miner is a vocal species with a large range of songs, calls, scoldings and alarms, and almost constant vocalizations particularly from young birds. One of four species in the genus \\"Manorina\\", the noisy miner itself is divided into four subspecies. The separation of the Tasmanian \\"M. m. leachi\\" is of long standing, and the mainland birds were further split in 1999.  - The yellow-throated miner (\\"Manorina flavigula\\") is a species of honeyeater, native to Australia. It is also commonly known as the white-rumped miner.  - The myna (also known as mynah) is a bird of the starling family (Sturnidae). This is a group of passerine birds which are native to southern Asia, especially India. Several species have been introduced to areas like North America, Australia, South Africa, Fiji and New Zealand, especially the common myna which is often regarded as an invasive species. Often known as \\"Selarang\\" in Singapore, due to their high population located at the area.  - The bell miner (\\"Manorina melanophrys\\"), commonly known as the bellbird, is a colonial honeyeater endemic to southeastern Australia. The common name refers to their bell-like call. \\"Miner\\" is an old alternative spelling of the word \\"myna\\" and is shared with other members of the genus \\"Manorina\\". The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as \\"bell lerps\\", of certain psyllid bugs that feed on eucalyptus sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell-lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.  - Eucalyptus L'Heritier 1789 is a diverse genus of flowering trees and shrubs (including a distinct group with a multiple-stem mallee growth habit) in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. Members of the genus dominate the tree flora of Australia, and include the tallest known flowering plant on Earth. There are more than 700 species of eucalyptus and most are native to Australia; a very small number are found in adjacent areas of New Guinea and Indonesia. One species, \\"Eucalyptus deglupta,\\" ranges as far north as the Philippines. Of the 15 species found outside Australia, just nine are exclusively non-Australian. Species of eucalyptus are cultivated widely in the tropical and temperate world, including the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, China, and the Indian subcontinent. However, the range over which many eucalypts can be planted in the temperate zone is constrained by their limited cold tolerance. Australia is covered by of eucalypt forest, comprising three quarters of the area covered by native forest.  - The black-eared miner (\\"Manorina melanotis\\") is an endangered honeyeater endemic to mallee woodland in south-eastern Australia.  - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia.

By Sarah Michael Fresh Australian milk has hit the shelves in Chinese supermarkets for the first time since a trade deal was struck by farmers to speed up the process of quarantine. With milk selling at up to 9 a litre in China it is set to provide a lucrative new source of income for dairy farmers in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, who have suffered in recent times due to drought and Australian supermarket 'milk wars'. Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce said the deal would see an additional 20 million litres of milk exported to China over the next year.

Question: \\"What crossed over?\\"  Context: \\"Since the mid-2000s, the mainstreaming of bands like Wilco and Feist have pushed indie rock into the adult contemporary conversation. In the early 2010s, indie musicians like Imagine Dragons, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters & Men, The Lumineers and Ed Sheeran also had indie songs that crossed over to the adult contemporary charts.\\"  Answer:","output":"In the context provided, the term \\"crossed over\\" refers to indie songs and artists that have gained significant popularity not just within their original indie rock genre, but also within the broader adult contemporary music scene. This transition for these artists means they managed to appeal to a wider audience, moving beyond their initial niche fan base and experiencing a surge in popularity and commercial success. Since the mid-2000s, several indie bands and musicians have successfully crossed over to the adult contemporary charts, garnering attention from a more diverse group of listeners. The mainstreaming of bands such as Wilco and Feist demonstrated an increasing interest in indie rock from adult contemporary enthusiasts. Simultaneously, this crossover has resulted in the blending of the two genres, creating a smoother, more accessible sound that caters to a wider range of music fans. In the early 2010s, this trend continued as more indie musicians and bands ventured into the adult contemporary territory. Notable artists during this time include Imagine Dragons, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters & Men, The Lumineers, and Ed Sheeran. These artists managed to create music that resonated with both their original fan base and the broader adult contemporary audience. A few factors have contributed to this phenomenon: 1. Evolving musical tastes: As the music landscape has evolved, so too have listeners' tastes. Fans of adult contemporary music have become more open to incorporating alternative sounds and styles, and this has allowed indie musicians to find their footing in this realm. 2. Streaming platforms: The rise of music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music has played a significant role in the crossover of indie songs into adult contemporary charts. These platforms provide tailored playlists and recommendations, making it easier for listeners to discover new music across genres. 3. Collaborations: Cross-genre collaborations have become increasingly common, allowing indie artists to work with established musicians from the adult contemporary scene. These collaborations have resulted in the creation of more accessible, genre-blending music that caters to a wide range of listeners. 4. Marketing: Indie artists and their record labels have embraced new marketing strategies to promote their music to broader audiences. Social media have made it easier for artists to connect directly with their fans and build a loyal following. This connectivity has, in turn, exposed their music to new listeners, enabling indie songs to cross over into the adult contemporary charts. 5. Live performances: Live music festivals and concerts often bring together diverse lineups of artists across various genres. As indie musicians share the stage with adult contemporary artists, their music is introduced to a wider audience and is more likely to experience crossover success. In summary, the crossover of indie songs to the adult contemporary charts has been the result of several factors, including evolving musical tastes, the rise of streaming platforms, cross-genre collaborations, strategic marketing, and exposure through live performances. As the boundaries between genres continue to blur, artists like Imagine Dragons, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters & Men, The Lumineers, and Ed Sheeran have become representative of a new musical era where adult contemporary and indie rock can coexist harmoniously."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs.

For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.

Barclays In A Pickle Fears about the skeletons that will emerge from Barclays' closet are mounting ahead of the publication of its annual results on Feb. 9. These were exacerbated after a downgrade of its long-term debt by ratings agency Moody's late on Saturday. Barclays (nyse: BCS - news - people )' long-term debt rating was cut to Aa3, from Aa1, while the bank's financial strength was cut to C, with a negative outlook, from B, in a report published by Moody's Investors Service late on Sunday, following a review that began last September. The downgrades reflect expectations of \\"potentially significant further losses\\" owing to write-downs on credit market exposure and an increase in impairments in the United Kingdom, warned the credit rating agency. Even though the bank has a strong market position in terms of deposits and the value of its brand name and franchise, its capital is only \\"average,\\" and merited it a \\"c\\" financial strength rating overall, said senior credit officer Elisabeth Rudman. Shares of Barclays have been on a roller coaster ride over the past two weeks, since Royal Bank of Scotland (nyse: RBS - news - people ), one of its chief rivals, warned of a possible 41.0 billion annual loss. After tumbling over fears that the bank would need more capital, they dashed up again last Monday, after Barclays said it was expecting net earnings of 5.3 billion pounds (7.3 billion) in 2008, while its core tier capital position was 23.5 billion above the Financial Services Authority's required level. However, the fragility of investor confidence was revealed on Monday, as shares of Barclays plunged anew, by 9.6%, in morning trade. Part of the reason that its reassurance about annual profits is failing to convince is that these appear to be the result of one-off gains, including from its takeover of the North American assets of Lehman Brothers Holdings and the sale of life insurance assets. (See \\"Barclays Reassurance Fails To Erase Doubts.\\") Investors are fearful about credit write-downs at its wholesale and corporate banking division, Barclays Capital, while the sharp deterioration of the British economy--rising unemployment and firms such as Woolworths collapsing--will mean Barclays will have to put ever more money aside to cover bad loans. The rise in bad loans is a major concern for the entire banking sector, with HSBC (nyse: HBC - news - people ) suffering slightly less than its competitors as a result of its large exposure to Asian markets. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the fears surrounding Barclays ahead of its annual results publication on February 9th, due to concerns about potential losses and credit market exposure. The situation is made worse by Moody's recent downgrade of the bank's long-term debt rating and financial strength rating.

Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\".  Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone.

For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period (row) of the table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group (column). The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory. The atomic radii decrease across the Periodic Table because as the atomic number increases, the number of protons increases across the period, but the extra electrons are only added to the same quantum shell. Therefore, the effective nuclear charge towards the outermost electrons increases, drawing the outermost electrons closer. As a result, the electron cloud contracts and the atomic radius decrease.  question: is there a relationship between atomic number and atomic radii for elements in a single period?

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.''

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship.

There are other forms of discipline, such as reproof and marking. Reproof is a less severe form of discipline given by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of their serious sin. The reproved person temporarily loses certain privileges of service but does not suffer from restrictions on social or spiritual fellowship. Meanwhile, marking is practiced for baptized members who persist in actions regarded as a violation of Bible principles but are not considered serious sins. This involves curtailing social but not spiritual fellowship. In summary, it is possible to avoid a serious sin but still commit one. Jehovah's Witnesses use various forms of discipline to address such matters, including disfellowshipping, reproof, and marking, depending on the severity of the sin, the individual's level of repentance, and the potential impact on the congregation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What are the human organs that are unneccesary to insects? Context: Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity.:61–65 Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles.

A combination lock, a bicycle lock or, most commonly, a simple padlock -- hundreds of them -- all inscribed with the names of lovers and clinging to the chain link railing of the Pont des Arts, the Bridge of Arts, the keys romantically tossed into the Seine flowing below. \\"Without you, my life doesn't make sense,\\" one of the locks reads in French. \\"Walter and Tammy engaged,\\" another announces to the world in English. You might easily miss the modest pedestrian bridge with the shiny accessories in the tourist rush to find historic Pont Neuf or the ornate Pont Alexandre III, but I am taking it slow on my second visit to Paris. There are no museums on my itinerary and no mad scrambles to fit in all of the city's famous sites. I've already seen the Mona Lisa, been to the top of the Eiffel Tower, gazed down on Napoleon's tomb and admired Notre Dame. This visit is for savoring Paris: walking to wherever fancy strikes, sitting in any park or café that looks inviting and eating as many baguettes, pastries and other delectable things as my budget (and figure) will allow. \\"Sleepless Night\\" When I arrive, \\"Purple Rain\\" is the talk of the town. It's the first weekend of October, so the streets of Paris are extra crowded for the annual Nuit Blanche -- White Night or Sleepless Night -- when museums stay open until dawn and organizers promise \\"surprising and unusual\\" art installations all over the city. One of them invites visitors to pick up a clear plastic umbrella and walk through a courtyard as rain machines and mauve lights make it look like they've stepped into Prince's hit song. I start each of my few days in Paris with champagne. It's right there, chilling in an ice bucket in the corner of my hotel's breakfast buffet every morning, not far from a pitcher of milk. Guests sip from their champagne flutes as casually as from their coffee cups as they fill up on cold cuts, cheeses and buttery croissants spread liberally with Nutella. An unexpected heat wave bathes Paris in summer light, so I take in the stunning views of the city from Sacre Coeur Basilica and go explore hilly, bohemian Montmartre. Who knew grapes grow in Paris? They bask in the sun on a slope on Rue des Saules in Clos Montmartre, the city's only vineyard. Not far away, you can feast on sea bass in butter sauce in Le Moulin de la Galette, a restaurant topped by a little 18th-century windmill -- one of only two that remain in the area. A poster quest. I take alarmingly frequent boulangerie and patisserie breaks. The bakery near my hotel, just off the Champs Elysées, has baskets of warm crunchy-soft baguettes and display cases full of elaborate sweets that you can't ignore. My favorite: a raspberry pistachio gateau, with the tart ruby fruit nestled in sweet clouds of pale green cream in between layers of flaky puff pastry. Heaven. Haunted by a poster of the Le Monde des Chimères restaurant that I've owned for years, I set out for Île Saint-Louis -- one of two islands in the Seine -- where the photo was taken. The restaurant now has a new name, Mon Vieil Ami, but I'm not disappointed. The peaceful little island, with its boutique-lined center street, is a charmer, and food temptations are all around: \\"lapin à la moutarde\\" (rabbit with mustard sauce), \\"chocolat noir\\" ice cream, \\"rhubarbe\\" sorbet. Close calls at Place de l'Étoile. For entertainment, I watch the crazy traffic around the Arc de Triomphe. There are no lanes and no traffic cops. Cars entering the circle have the right of way, and they roar into the giant roundabout as the other cars already in it (and going alarmingly fast) squeal to a stop, sometimes with just inches to spare. There are honks and angry hand gestures as vehicles of every imaginable size -- from tiny Smart cars to giant tour buses -- negotiate the circle with equal zeal. Want to exit the roundabout into one of the 12 avenues fanning out of it? Just cut diagonally in front of all the other traffic. It's both terrifying and fascinating to watch. When I ask the concierge at my hotel whether she drives around the arch, she smiles and shrugs her shoulders, \\"Sure, you just do it. You just keep going; otherwise the other cars will just\\" -- here she's at a loss for words and mimes what looks like vehicles swerving wildly around her. Her colleague at the front desk then confesses that when her husband goes around the arch, \\"I just close my eyes.\\" They tell me that when there is an accident at the Place de l'Étoile, the insurance companies of both drivers always split the bill 50/50. It's just too difficult to ever determine who is at fault. \\"But there are no accidents,\\" one of the women insists. Cheese heaven. For a traffic-free experience, I head to Rue Cler, a pedestrian market street not far from the Eiffel Tower where Julia Child used to shop. You can sit down for a meal or assemble a moveable feast at the fruit, produce and specialty food shops that dot the area. The fromagerie itself is worthy of the trip: There are hundreds of varieties of cheeses for sale, their collective aroma wafting out into the street. You could make it your mission to try one cheese each day of the year and still not go through them all. For now, my time is running out. I watch one more time as the Eiffel Tower sparkles like a champagne glass at night, with the hourly evening light show eliciting oohs, aahs and applause from the crowd on the Champ de Mars.

Surgeon Abbas Khan, 32, from Streatham, south London, was found dead in his cell just days before the Syrian government said he was due to be freed. The UK Foreign Office said he was \\"in effect murdered\\" but the Syrian authorities claim he took his own life. The coroner told the jury his mother had been \\"extraordinarily persistent\\". Giving evidence in court, the orthopaedic surgeon's mother, Fatima Khan, said she went to Syria in July 2013 and visited a number of embassies and prisons to trace her son. She said some of the cars she travelled in came under sniper fire, adding: \\"I felt scared, but my son was here so I had to be brave\\". She finally saw him at the Court of Terrorism at the end of July. \\"I hugged him. He was a skeleton. He was in tears. I said, 'Look, mummy is here for you'. He said, 'Sorry, I shouldn't have come here, please take me home',\\" she said. Her son was missing a fingernail and his feet were completely burnt, Ms Khan said. When questioned over his injuries he replied: \\"This is nothing, I have suffered more than this'.\\" Dr Khan later described how the conditions were \\"like hell\\" with cockroaches, mice and faeces on the floor, his mother said. He added he was beaten up by other inmates and interrogated by men who beat him with rubber hoses, the jury heard. On 22 November 2012, Dr Khan was detained while out for a walk while working in a hospital in Aleppo to help civil war victims. He was found dead on 16 December 2013. Chief coroner Judge Peter Thornton said the father of two was found \\"allegedly hanged\\" while in custody in Damascus. Mr Khan's family has always maintained he was murdered, despite the Syrian authorities' assertions he killed himself. The coroner said the main issues for the jury to consider after hearing all the evidence were likely to be: did Dr Khan take his own life, or was he \\"forced in some way by his captors to take his own life against his will\\", or was he \\"unlawfully killed\\" by his captors?

We end up with -4 LEGO blocks. So, our new equation looks like this: -4*w - 16 = 0 Now, we want to find the value of w (just like finding the missing LEGO piece that we need). To do that, let's get the -4*w part by itself. We do this by adding 16 to both sides of the equation: -4*w - 16 + 16 = 0 + 16 This simplifies to: -4*w = 16 Next, we need to get the \\"w\\" by itself. Since -4 is being multiplied by w, we need to do the opposite to get rid of the -4 (like when we break our LEGO blocks apart!). We will divide both sides by -4: (-4*w) / -4 = 16 / -4 This simplifies to: w = -4 And that's it, little buddy! We found the missing piece - w equals -4!

From March 29 to April 19, a new version of Death of a Salesman  was performedat tne Capital Theatre as the first in a series of  foreign classics to mark the 60th anniversary of the Beijing People's Art  Theatre.The last time this play was performed in Beijing was 29 years ago.  Death of a Salesman was created in 1949 by Arthur Miller, who used it to reveal the weakness of the \\"American Dream\\" .The main character, Willy Loman, believes wholeheartedly in American capitalism, and desires to \\"succeed\\" but his own greed _ him in the end.Death of a Salesman's first performance was a huge hit on Broadway, where it shocked the American theatre world, and strengthened the 33-year-old Miller's status as a master of American theatre.The play won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, New York Drama Critics' Circle, and the Tony Award for Best Play.The New York Times praised Death of a Salesman as a milestone of 20th century theatre.In 1999, Death of a Salesman received another Tony Award for Best Revival, and the then 83-year-old Miller was given the National Medal of Arts.  The 1983 version of Death of a Salesman was directed personally by Arthur Miller on a visit to China, with Beijing director and actor Ying Ruocheng as the main character of Willy Loman.On May 7, 1983, the play was performed for the first time at the Capital Theatre, and the first series of performances lasted until August 18, with over 50 performances, some of which filled the house, and all of which had great influence.  When it was first performed here, China didn't have \\"salesman\\" , so the actors had to use their imagination to represent the characters and American society, and the audiences weren't entirely sure about some information.For example, they couldn't understand what \\"fixed payments\\" were, or why, if Willy was a lower-class member of American society, his family had a house, car, refrigerator, and television.But this didn't stop the play from becoming a widely-known page in Beijing's theatre history. 1.

Article: Today most Chinese teenagers are happy to be favored by two parents and four grandparents in their families. But have you ever thought about how to take care of four to twelve old people when you grow up and get married? This could be a problem for most Chinese youths as China is entering a new stage of an aging society. An aging society refers to one where 10 percent or more of its population is over 60. By the end of 2007, Chinese over 60 years old have made up 11.7 percent of the nation's total population. \\"China is getting old before becoming rich,\\"said Cai Chuang, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The population increase that has powered Chinese growth for three decades will give way over the next ten years to a rapid aging of the society. This will lead to weaker economic growth, because of a lack of labor resources. As a result of the family planning policy, it is expected that the country's total working population will decrease after 2015. China is not the only country getting old. More that 60 countries have become aging societies and one in three people in the European Union is a senior citizen. However, experts said that China doesn't have a highly developed social security network to support the old. Social security is an insurance program protecting those in need, including the old, the disabled and others. Question: If China enters an aging society,   _  .

This is because an aging society refers to one where 10 percent or more of its population is over 60, and in China's case, the population increase that has powered its growth for three decades will eventually lead to a rapid aging of the society. This will result in weaker economic growth due to a lack of labor resources.

The maquiladoras hire mostly Mexican women to work long hours for little money in order to produce mass quantity products. Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez), an impassioned American news reporter for the \\"Chicago Sentinel\\" wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war. Instead, her editor George Morgan (Martin Sheen) assigns her to investigate a series of slayings involving young maquiladora factory women in a Mexican bordertown.

The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes. Adrian heads to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua, on the U.S.âMexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent.

The driver tries to assault her in the same way he did Eva, and although police assistance has been arranged, they are at the wrong place. She manages to escape her attacker.

Options: - train station - convention - workplace - wedding - theater  Explain why a human would choose \\"convention\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"convention\\" as the answer to the question because a convention is an event where people with similar interests or professions gather to share ideas, network, learn about new trends, and engage in discussions related to their field or industry.  Let's break down each option to better understand why \\"convention\\" is the most appropriate choice: 1. Train station: A train station is a place where people travel from one location to another. It does not typically serve as a gathering place for people who do the same kind of work, as individuals from various professions use train stations for transportation. 2. Convention: As mentioned earlier, conventions are organized events where people with similar interests, professions, or industries gather to exchange ideas, learn, and network. This makes a convention the most likely place for people who do the same kind of work to gather. 3. Workplace: While people who do the same kind of work may be found within their respective workplaces, it is not a common gathering place for people from different organizations or companies within the same field. Workplaces are generally limited to the employees of a specific company or organization. 4. Wedding: A wedding is a social event where family and friends come together to celebrate the union of two individuals. Guests at weddings typically have diverse interests and professional backgrounds, so it is not a likely gathering place for people who do the same kind of work. 5. Theater: A theater is a venue where people come to watch performances or movies. Despite being a popular place for entertainment, it does not typically serve as a gathering spot for individuals within the same profession to discuss or engage in activities related to their field. In conclusion, a convention is the most appropriate answer because it is specifically designed to bring together people who share similar interests, professions, or industries, making it the most likely place for individuals who do the same kind of work to gather."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the two names for the Middle French prose work that made up half of the entire Lancelot-Grail Cycle?  Up to c. 1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art. Answer:","output":"The two names for the Middle French prose work that made up half of the entire Lancelot-Grail Cycle are the Vulgate Cycle and the Lancelot-Grail Cycle.

It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:Figures directly comparing the NHS in the four UK nations have been released for the first time. Stroke mortality rates and asthma hospital admissions are particularly encouraging for Wales. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said: \\"Most importantly it helps us know where we can do better for the people of Wales.\\" The comparable figures have been put together at the recommendation of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  following a review of how health services were performing a year ago. The OECD normally only receives health statistics on a UK-wide basis but wants to see in future how the devolved NHS is performing. Altogether, 13 different indicators have been published. On the figures involving deaths in hospital from strokes from a bleed in the brain, Wales is at a lower rate than the UK average. Health officials believe this could be due to the focus in improving stroke care in Wales since 2009 - after it was found to be faring badly - which led last week to a new stroke action plan being published. There is also an improving picture across the UK of patients surviving in hospital after being admitted with heart attacks. Wales is similar to the UK's 30-day mortality rate [the number dying within 30 days] and better than Scotland's figure. The use of balloon angioplasty and better drugs when patients are admitted have been suggested as factors. Male heart patients in Wales had the lowest mortality rate of the home nations in this measure, although the drop in the mortality rate among women in Wales was the smallest. The figures also show Wales is: Mr Gething said it was \\"good news\\" Wales was performing better than average in some areas. \\"These figures provide us with a useful way of measuring and comparing, where appropriate, the quality of health service provision in the UK,\\" he said. \\"As the numbers of indicators increase over time we look forward to seeing how our innovative health policies are having an impact against the other home nations.\\" It is being stressed that this first set of figures is only experimental. They only involve statistics up to 2013 and do not include waiting times, although the OECD as part of its work does look at how long patients wait to see a specialist. But it is hoped they will help give a more rounded picture of healthcare between Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

They are studying bacteria: Bob studies nitrogen fixating bacteria, while Andy studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes.  But I can use this background: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.  What is an answer for this question: Which researcher learned less about sulfate reduction? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Andy, who studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes, would likely have learned less about sulfate reduction as compared to Bob.

Build a movie plot around this: what does the little girl ask the gang to do? to discover why her parents were killed Answer:","output":"Title: The Echoes of Truth Genre: Action, Drama, Mystery Plot Summary: A 9-year-old orphan, Lily, seeks answers about her parents' mysterious death. With no other viable options, she enlists the help of an underground team of skilled misfits, the Whisperers, to solve the puzzle. As they delve deeper into a web of conspiracy, they begin to understand the darkness lurking in their shadows of their city, and uncover the truth that could change everything. Act 1:  Meet Lily (9 years old), living in an orphanage in the heart of a city notorious for crime and corruption. Struggling with nightmares of her parents' death, she spends her days trying to gather any information she can. One day, as Lily roams the city's streets, she is saved from a dangerous encounter by a member of the underground group known as the Whisperers. Intrigued by their skills and abilities, Lily sees a glimmer of hope in her quest for answers. Act 2:  After saving Lily, the Whisperer, known as Shadow, brings her back to their hideout. There, she is introduced to the gang's leader, Razor, and the rest of the team - Ghost, a stealthy hacker; Blaze, an explosives expert; and Viper, a quick-witted and agile fighter. The group is hesitant to aid Lily in her quest but is ultimately swayed by her determination and the realization that her story may be much bigger than it seems. Act 3:  As the Whisperers help Lily uncover the truth behind her parents' death, they start to unravel a conspiracy tied to the city's elite, who have been engaging in illegal activities and covering it up. The gang discovers that Lily's parents were investigative journalists who had discovered the truth behind the corruption, and were on the verge of exposing it when they were assassinated to silence them. Act 4:  Now aware of their powerful adversaries, the Whisperers come up with an elaborate plan to seek justice for Lily's parents. Along the way, the team encounters numerous obstacles, including not one, but two double-crossing informants within their inner circle. Sal, an old friend of Razor's, ends up being a mole for one of the city’s top bosses. Meanwhile, Arielle, the orphanage's seemingly innocent caregiver, serves another crime lord, vowing to prevent the gang from revealing their secrets. Act 5:  The Whisperers, through skillful coordination and teamwork, are able to expose the truth about Lily's parents and spark a city-wide movement against the corrupt elite. They put the crime lords behind bars and dismantle their network, restoring a semblance of order and justice to the city. Lily is embraced by the Whisperers, and together they vow to keep the city safe from any future threats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are closely linked but don't exactly ask the same thing. Question 1 asks for a detailed interpretation or thoughts about the juxtaposition between imaginary time and real time as described by Stephen Hawking, involving an analysis of the differences, similarities, and implications of these two concepts. Question 2, on the other hand, asks for a direct explanation of what Stephen Hawking's concept of imaginary time is. Stephen Hawking's concept of imaginary time is intriguing and necessitates a deep understanding of theoretical physics and the nature of our universe. To comprehend this concept, we need to delve into the realm of quantum physics and the theory of relativity. The notion of \\"Imaginary Time\\" is derived from quantum mechanics and it is a concept that's used primarily in the modeling of quantum cosmology. Hawking suggested that our conventional understanding of time, which he referred to as \\"real time,\\" may only be part of the picture. He proposed that \\"imaginary time\\" is another dimension of time that runs perpendicular to ordinary or \\"real\\" time. It is fundamentally a way of looking at the time dimension at right angles to the conventional or \\"real\\" time axis. As such, it doesn't have a start or end; it's cyclical, which resolves some major paradoxes in physics. Dr. Hawking used these concepts while proposing a model for the universe that has no boundaries—no beginning or end. He believed that if we take the vertical dimension as imaginary time and horizontal dimensions as spatial, this would result in a space-time that's finite in extent but without any boundaries or edges. This is the essence of the Hartle-Hawking state, a proposition about the universe's initial state.  Imaginary time isn't something one can experience, but it has real effects since it is used to calculate paths of particles. When one states that something happens in imaginary time, they suggest that it happens in a way that's orthogonal to the way we perceive time flowing.  The major difference between \\"real time\\" and \\"imaginary time\\" is the sense of direction or arrow of time. Real time has a clear direction – from the past through the present to the future. In contrast, imaginary time does not have a defined direction. For us, it's impossible to perceive imaginary time because we're caught in real time's arrow. In essence, Hawking's concept of imaginary time is a mathematical device that aids in understanding certain aspects of the universe that are otherwise inexplicable by the standard theories of physics. As such, the concept plays a fundamental role in theories that attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, where all our notions of classic reality seem to breakdown. Nevertheless, the concept of imaginary time is complex, theoretical, and largely mathematical and doesn't have an effect on our daily lives or our experience of reality.  To sum up, while both questions invite a discussion of Stephen Hawking's concept of imaginary time, the first one asks for a broader reflection on the comparison between this concept and the idea of real time, while the second one is looking for clarification of what imaginary time actually means."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

Julien is an ex-Foreign Legion parachutist officer and a veteran of Indochina and Algeria. After working late on a Saturday, he climbs up one story on the outside of the office building on a rope, shoots Carala in his office without being seen, and arranges the room to make it look like a suicide. It is now past business closing hours. Seated at the curb in his convertibleâas its top is slowly retractingâjust before pulling away from the office building he glances up and he sees his rope hanging over the balcony edge in plain sight. He leaves the car running and rushes back into the building. While he is ascending in an elevator, the building custodian, or security man, switches off the power to the elevators, and Julien is trapped between floors. Julien's car is stolen by a young couple, small-time crook Louis (Poujouly) and flower-seller Veronique (Bertin). Florence, who is waiting for Julien at a cafe, sees the car go by with Veronique leaning out of the window. She assumes that Julien has run off with Veronique and wanders the Paris streets despondently all night asking for him in the bars and clubs where he is known. Whiel joy-riding and racing other cars, Louis puts on Julien's coat and gloves.

Yes The statement \\"Digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides.\\" is a good answer to the question \\"Where does the digestion of some fats start?\\". This answer is detailed and informative, providing insights into the specific location and enzymes involved in the digestion process.  To further elaborate, digestion is a complex process that begins as soon as food enters the mouth. Mechanical digestion starts with chewing, which breaks down food into smaller pieces, while chemical digestion occurs with the help of enzymes. In the case of fats, lingual lipase, an enzyme secreted by the salivary glands in the mouth, initiates their breakdown. Fats, also known as lipids, are a crucial component of our diet. They provide energy, support cell growth, and play a role in vital functions like nutrient absorption and hormone production. However, fats are not water-soluble, which makes it difficult for our bodies to process them. Enzymes like lingual lipase facilitate the digestion and absorption of fats by breaking them down into smaller, more soluble molecules called diglycerides. It is important to note that lingual lipase is more active in breaking down short-chain lipids. This means that the digestion of some fats begins in the mouth, while others need to be broken down further within the gastrointestinal tract, where pancreatic lipase and other enzymes continue the digestion process. Once the fats are broken down into absorbable molecules, they can be taken up by the intestinal mucosa and further processed by the body. In summary, the statement provides an accurate and appropriate response to the question of where the digestion of some fats begins. It highlights the role of the mouth and lingual lipase in the initial breakdown of short-chain lipids, setting the stage for the complex process of fat digestion that unfolds within the human body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Allan David Bloom (September 14, 1930 - October 7, 1992) was an American philosopher, classicist, and academician. He studied under David Grene, Leo Strauss, Richard McKeon, and Alexandre Kojeve. He subsequently taught at Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Yale University, Ecole Normale Superieure of Paris, and the University of Chicago. Bloom championed the idea of Great Books education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American higher education, with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, The Closing of the American Mind. Allan Bloom was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1930 to second-generation Jewish parents who were both social workers. The couple had a daughter, Lucille, two years earlier. As a thirteen-year-old, Bloom read a Readers Digest article about the University of Chicago and told his parents he wanted to attend; his parents thought it was unreasonable and did not encourage his hopes. Yet, when his family moved to Chicago in 1944, his parents met a psychiatrist and family friend whose son was enrolled in the University of Chicago's humanities program for gifted students. In 1946, Bloom was accepted to the same program, starting his degree at the age of fifteen, and spending the next decade of his life enrolled at the University in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. This began his lifelong passion for the 'idea' of the university.  In the preface to Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960-1990, he stated that his education \\"began with Freud and ended with Plato\\". The theme of this education was self-knowledge, or self-discovery--an idea that Bloom would later write, seemed impossible to conceive of for a Midwestern American boy. He credits Leo Strauss as the teacher who made this endeavor possible for him.  Bloom graduated from the University of Chicago with his Bachelor's Degree at the age of 18. One of his college classmates was the classicist Seth Benardete. For post-graduate studies, he enrolled in the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought, where he was assigned Classicist David Grene as tutor, and went on to write his thesis on Isocrates. Grene recalled Bloom as an energetic and humorous student completely dedicated to studying classics, but with no definite career ambitions. The Committee was a unique interdisciplinary program that attracted a small number of students due to its rigorous academic requirements and lack of clear employment opportunities after graduation. Bloom earned his Ph.D. from the Committee on Social Thought in 1955. He subsequently studied under the influential Hegelian philosopher Alexandre Kojeve in Paris, whose lectures Bloom would later introduce to the English-speaking world. While teaching philosophy at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, he befriended Raymond Aron, amongst many other philosophers. Among the American expatriate community in Paris his friends included leftist writer Susan Sontag.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to which bird is the film happy feet about??","output":"\\"Happy Feet\\" is a 2006 computer-animated musical comedy film directed, produced, and co-written by George Miller. The film is about a young Emperor Penguin named Mumble, who is voiced by Elijah Wood. Emperor Penguins are the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species, native to Antarctica. The central plot of \\"Happy Feet\\" revolves around Mumble, who is born with an inability to sing the \\"heartsong\\" that characterizes all Emperor Penguins. Instead, he has an extraordinary talent for tap dancing, which he mainly uses to communicate his emotions and thoughts. As the penguins rely on their unique voices to find their soulmates and establish lifelong bonds, Mumble's inability to sing isolates him from the rest of the colony, including his father, who considers him an outsider. Throughout the movie, Mumble embarks on an epic adventure that takes him to unexplored lands, where he learns that being different can be a strength rather than a handicap. Along the way, he encounters other penguin species and marine animals who help him understand the importance of environmental conservation and the effects of human activities on Antarctica's delicate ecosystem, including overfishing that leads to a shortage of food supply for the penguin colony. Throughout his journey, Mumble becomes a hero and a leader, rallying the other penguins and inspiring them to celebrate their differences and unite against the common threats they face. The film highlights essential themes like individuality, diversity, tolerance, environmental awareness, and the importance of collective action. \\"Happy Feet\\" became a critical and commercial success, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The film was praised for its stunning animation, engaging storyline, and memorable characters. Its universal themes have resonated with audiences of all ages, making it a beloved classic in animated cinema.

Answer:","output":"The prison portrayed in \\"The Green Mile\\" is called the Cold Mountain Penitentiary. \\"The Green Mile\\" is a popular novel written by Stephen King in 1996 and later adapted into a critically acclaimed film directed by Frank Darabont, released in 1999. The story takes place in the 1930s and follows the lives of prison guards who work at Cold Mountain Penitentiary's death row, known as \\"The Green Mile\\" due to the green linoleum tiles covering the floor. Cold Mountain Penitentiary, situated in Louisiana, is a fictional prison where the narrative revolves around the experiences of the prison guards and inmates, particularly those who await execution. The main characters include the protagonist, Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, who is one of the supervising officers; the mystical and empathic prisoner John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan; and several other individuals connected to their lives. The Green Mile is named as such because of the color of the floor that leads the condemned inmates from their cells to the electric chair. The green floor symbolizes the final walk, with the condemned prisoner walking on it toward their fate. This title also emphasizes the emotional and psychological journey that inmates and officers experience in the face of life and death. Within the prison, a variety of themes are explored, such as redemption, forgiveness, justice, and compassion. These themes are largely portrayed through the character relationships and moments of supernatural occurrences. The prison serves as a backdrop for these themes, shaping the lives of both inmates and prison staff as they navigate through the complex morality issues surrounding capital punishment. In conclusion, the prison in \\"The Green Mile\\" is called Cold Mountain Penitentiary, and it serves as the primary setting for Stephen King's novel and the subsequent film adaptation. The name \\"The Green Mile\\" is derived from the green-colored floor that leads the condemned inmates from their cell to the electric chair, representing both the literal and figurative journey toward their impending execution. This fictional prison explores profound themes related to capital punishment while delving into the lives of inmates and prison staff during the 1930s."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"Which of the following can decrease stamina?\\" would be \\"Cigarettes.\\" This is because the teacher mentioned that smoking tobacco decreases stamina and that tobacco is most commonly smoked in cigarettes.  To further elaborate, smoking cigarettes can lead to a decrease in stamina as they contain numerous harmful substances, such as nicotine and tar, which are detrimental to one's respiratory system. When someone smokes, these substances reduce the efficiency of the lungs, limiting the intake of oxygen and ultimately hampering the body's ability to generate energy. Oxygen is a critical component for maintaining stamina during physical activities as it enables the body to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an essential molecule that provides energy for various cellular processes. Repeated exposure to cigarette smoke can also impair blood circulation, decreasing the delivery of oxygen and essential nutrients to cells and tissues, ultimately leading to diminished energy levels and reduced stamina. Furthermore, smoking can exacerbate health problems, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which further exacerbate stamina-related issues. While some of the other options may also be associated with decreased stamina (such as toxins, dehydration, hypothyroidism, etc.) the most accurate and fitting answer based on the teacher's hints is undoubtedly \\"Cigarettes.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict. Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators. It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring. In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing.

Cold can affect other parts of the body.The expression \\"get cold feet\\" has nothing to do with cold or your feet.The expression means being afraid to do something you have decided to do.For example, you agree to be president of an organization.But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned, and all the work of the organizations will be your responsibility.You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation. The expression \\"give someone the cold shoulder\\" probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face to face.You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you.Or, to someone who has lied about you to others. A cold fish is not a fish.It is a person.But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth.A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone.Someone who is a cold fish could be cold-hearted.Now a cold-hearted person is someone who has no sympathy.Several popular songs in recent years were about cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feelings, broke the hearts of their lovers. \\"Out in the cold\\" means not getting something that everybody else got.A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise----he was left out in the cold.And it is not a pleasant place to be.

Write an article based on this \\"The Scottish government has agreed to change the wording of its independence referendum question, after concerns it may lead people to vote 'Yes'.\\"","output":"Title: The Scottish Government Adjusts Independence Referendum Question Following Concerns Around Biased Wording Introduction The Scottish government has recently made the decision to amend the wording of its upcoming independence referendum question. This decision comes amid growing concerns that the original phrasing of the question may have led to an unintentional bias, inadvertently persuading people to vote in favor of Scottish independence. The move marks a crucial step toward promoting a fair and unbiased democratic process, as the citizens of Scotland prepare to decide their nation's political future. Background of the Scottish Independence Referendum Scotland's quest for independence has been a contentious issue ever since the 2014 referendum, wherein voters narrowly decided against becoming an independent nation, with 55% voting to stay a part of the UK. However, following the UK's divisive decision to leave the European Union (EU) in 2016, commonly referred to as Brexit, the demand for a second referendum on Scottish independence surged among the people of Scotland. The Scottish National Party (SNP), led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has been at the forefront of this movement, echoing the sentiments of the majority of Scottish citizens who had voted against Brexit, fearing the consequences of their nation being pulled out of the EU. As such, the SNP has sought to hold a second independence referendum in order to ascertain whether the people of Scotland would wish to secede from the UK and forge a new path as an independent nation. The Consequences of a Biased Question An unbiased question plays a critical role in upholding the integrity of any democratic process. In the case of the Scottish independence referendum, the original phrasing had raised concerns as some individuals deemed the language to be subconsciously persuasive toward voting in favor of independence. Groups opposing Scottish independence had argued that the existing question could have potentially undermined the validity of the referendum's outcome. By casting doubt on the impartiality of the vote's very foundation - the question posed to the electorate - it was feared that any resulting decision would be marred by accusations of an unfair process. The Scottish Government's Decision to Amend the Question In pursuit of an unbiased and fair referendum, the Scottish government opted to address these concerns by modifying the phrasing of the question. Recognizing the significance of the independence referendum and its consequences on the future of Scotland, the move demonstrates the authority's commitment to upholding democratic principles and respecting the will of the people. This decision was met with appreciation from citizens and political rivals alike, as it ensures an environment where the Scottish electorate will be able to express their opinions freely and fairly on the highly debated issue of independence. The Impact of the Decision on the Referendum The Scottish government's adjustment to the wording of the referendum question is a crucial element in the run-up to the historic vote. This move is expected to have numerous effects on the referendum process, including: 1. Bolstering the legitimacy of the outcome: By presenting an unbiased question to the voters, the outcome of the referendum will be less susceptible to allegations of manipulation or favoritism. 2. Encouraging inclusive debate: With concerns about the question's impartiality diminished, the focus can now shift to engaging in a healthy discourse about the advantages and disadvantages of Scottish independence. 3. Ensuring an informed decision-making process: A neutral question will be instrumental in preventing any undue influence on voters, allowing them to make a decision based on their understanding of the issue and its potential impact on the country. Conclusion The Scottish government’s decision to alter the wording of the independence referendum question stands as a testament to its commitment to conducting a fair and impartial democratic process. As Scotland braces itself for a crucial vote, maintaining the integrity of the process will play an essential role in shaping the nation's future. In fostering an environment that champions unbiased discussion and informed decision-making, the citizens of Scotland will ultimately determine the path their country will follow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the below context:  Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...

Is it true that was france an ally of germany in ww2 based on the following text? In March 1939, Germany took over Czechoslovakia, violating the Munich Agreement signed six months before, and demonstrating that the appeasement policy was a failure. Britain and France decided that Hitler had no intention to uphold diplomatic agreements and responded by preparing for war. On 31 March 1939, Britain formed the Anglo-Polish military alliance in an effort to avert a German attack on the country. Also, the French had a long-standing alliance with Poland since 1921. The Soviet Union sought an alliance with the western powers, but Hitler ended the risk of a war with Stalin by signing the Nazi--Soviet non-aggression pact in August 1939. The agreement secretly divided the independent nations of Eastern Europe between the two powers and assured adequate oil supplies for the German war machine. On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland; two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany. Then, on 17 September 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east. A Polish government-in-exile was set up and it continued to be one of the Allies, a model followed by other occupied countries. After a quiet winter, Germany in April 1940 invaded and quickly defeated Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and France. Britain and its Empire stood alone against Hitler and Mussolini. In June 1941, Hitler broke the non-aggression agreement with Stalin and Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In December, Japan attacked the US and Britain.

I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said \\"Why you guys doing that?

This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.

Can you tell me the answer to where did the 80 20 rule come from??","output":"The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is a concept which posits that 80% of results or outcomes come from 20% of efforts or causes. The rule emerged from the work and observations of Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist and sociologist, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has since been applied to various fields such as economics, business, and even personal productivity. Vilfredo Pareto was born on July 15, 1848, in Paris, France, and later moved to Genoa, Italy, where he studied at the Polytechnic School of Turin. Early in his career, Pareto shifted his focus from engineering to economics and sociology, becoming a renowned economist and professor at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. The origins of the 80/20 rule can be traced to Pareto's observations of wealth distribution and resource allocation in Italy. While working on a study of income distribution in 1896, Pareto noticed a recurring pattern: approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population, while the remaining 20% of the land was held by the other 80% of the citizens. Intrigued by this observation, he expanded his research to other European countries and found a very similar distribution pattern of wealth and resources. Pareto's work on income and wealth distribution later led him to develop the concept of the 80/20 rule. The Pareto Principle doesn't imply an exact ratio of 80/20; instead, it proposes that a small proportion of inputs (typically around 20%) generate a majority (often around 80%) of output or results. He also introduced the idea of \\"Pareto efficiency,\\" a state in which resources are allocated in such a way that any further changes would benefit some individuals only at the expense of others. In the years that followed, the Pareto Principle gained widespread recognition and started being applied to various fields beyond economics. For instance, in business, it became a popular management tool for identifying the critical few factors that contributed the most to a given outcome—such as client satisfaction, sales, or employee performance. The rule has also been employed in software engineering, where it serves as a guideline for addressing critical bugs and errors, or prioritizing features that have the greatest impact on users. The 80/20 rule has even found its way into personal productivity strategies, as people identify their most important tasks or habits and focus on addressing those to yield the greatest results. In summary, the 80/20 rule, or Pareto Principle, was conceived by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in the late 19th century after he observed a persisting pattern in the distribution of wealth and resources. Since then, the rule has been adapted and applied to numerous fields and contexts, providing valuable insights for prioritizing efforts and maximizing outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is considered a major influence on the action genre, known for his highly chaotic action sequences, Mexican standoffs, and frequent use of slow motion. Woo has directed several notable Hong Kong action films, among them, \\"A Better Tomorrow\\" (1986), \\"The Killer\\" (1989), \\"Hard Boiled\\" (1992), and \\"Red Cliff\\" (2008/2009).   - Mainland China, also known as the Chinese mainland or simply the mainland, is the geopolitical area under the direct jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It generally excludes the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau; however, it usually includes Hainan. The term \\"mainland China\\", which avoids calling the area simply \\"China\\" and thereby recognizing the founding of the PRC as \\"the\\" \\"China\\", was coined by the Kuomintang (KMT) after receiving control of Taiwan from Japan after World War II. By 1949, the KMT-led Republic of China (ROC) government was defeated in the Chinese Civil War in mainland China and fled to the island of Taiwan where the KMT pledged to \\"retake the Mainland\\". The KMT considers both sides of the Taiwan Strait (including Taiwan), as (one) \\"China\\" and one country, whereas Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) considers only mainland China as \\"China\\" and Taiwan (ROC) as \\"Taiwan\\" and maintains that they are different countries.  - The Pearl River Delta (PRD), also known as Zhujiang Delta or Zhusanjiao, is the low-lying area surrounding the Pearl River estuary, where the Pearl River flows into the South China Sea. It is one of the most densely urbanised regions in the world and is an economic hub of China. This region is often considered an emerging megacity. The PRD is a megalopolis, with future development into a single mega metropolitan area, yet itself is at the southern end of a larger megalopolis running along the southern coast of China, which include metropolises such as Chaoshan, Zhangzhou-Xiamen, Quanzhou-Putian, and Fuzhou. The nine largest cities of PRD had a combined population of 57.15 million at the end of 2013, comprising 53.69% of the provincial population. According to the World Bank Group, the PRD has become the largest urban area in the world in both size and population.  - Hu Jinquan (29 April 1932  14 January 1997), better known as King Hu, was a Chinese film director based in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He is best known for directing various \\"wuxia\\" films in the 1960s and 1970s, which brought Chinese cinema (including Hong Kong and Taiwan) to new technical and artistic heights. His films \\"Come Drink with Me\\" (1966), \\"Dragon Gate Inn\\" (1967), and \\"A Touch of Zen\\" (19691971) inaugurated a new generation of \\"wuxia\\" films in the late 1960s. Apart from being a film director, Hu was also a screenwriter and set designer.  - Andy Lau Tak-wah, BBS, MH, JP (born 27 September 1961) is a Hong Kong actor, singer and film producer.

Mui once held a sold-out concert in Hammersmith, London, England, where she was dubbed the \\"Madonna of Asia\\" (), which brought her to further international fame. That title stayed with her throughout her career, and has been used as a comparison for both Eastern and Western media.  - Cantopop (a contraction of \\"Cantonese pop music\\") or HK-pop (short for \\"Hong Kong pop music\\") is a genre of Cantonese music made primarily in Hong Kong, and also used to refer to the cultural context of its production and consumption. Originating in the 1970s, Cantopop reached its height of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s before its slow decline in the 2000s. The term \\"Cantopop\\" itself was coined in 1978 after \\"Cantorock\\", a term first used in 1974. During its height, Cantopop had spread to China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.  - Chan Kong-sang, SBS, MBE, PMW, (born 7 April 1954), known professionally as Jackie Chan, is a Hong Kong martial artist, actor, film director, producer, stuntman and singer.

It combines elements from the action film, as codified by Hollywood, with Chinese storytelling, aesthetic traditions and filmmaking techniques, to create a culturally distinctive form that nevertheless has a wide transcultural appeal. In recent years, the flow has reversed somewhat, with American and European action films being heavily influenced by Hong Kong genre conventions.  - Macau (literally: \\"Bay Gate\\"), (in Portuguese, which is still widely used in the city) also spelled Macao (in English), officially the Região Administrativa Especial de Macau da República Popular da China, is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta in East Asia. Macau is bordered by the city of Zhuhai in China to the North and the Pearl River Estuary to the East and South. Hong Kong lies about to its East across the Delta. With a population of 650,900 living in an area of , it is the most densely populated region in the world.  - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.  - Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the \\"discovery stage\\", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had. Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments. Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed. Tasha looked at me as if to say, \\"I will.\\" She said, \\"I feel sorry for you, Nardo. I'll see Emil home.\\" \\"Yes,\\" I said, \\"Do that,\\" and did not care what she did, or why. Emil asked, \\"You're all right?\\" I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent. They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves. Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself, I finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping Flamingo to drink myself to sleep. She had not come home when I woke in mid-morning.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"They had too much to drink\\" correctly answer the question \\"Why does the narrator state that she does \\"not remember any of this well\\"?\\"? Available options: a. no; b. yes;","output":"b. yes The response \\"They had too much to drink\\" correctly answers the question \\"Why does the narrator state that she does \\"not remember any of this well\\"?\\" as the paragraph begins with the narrator's confession of having drunk too much. The excess drinking likely resulted in the narrator's impaired memory and inability to recall the events clearly. Furthermore, the narrator admits that everyone present had consumed an excessive amount of alcohol, which adds to the chaotic and unreliable nature of the memories. The paragraph provides a detailed account of the argument between the narrator and Tasha, despite the narrator admitting to not having a clear memory of the events due to their intoxicated state. The argument involves various subjects, like Solevgrad jazz and Tasha's obsession with fame, and seems to create tension among the people involved. As the night progresses, the narrator becomes increasingly disgusted with themselves and seeks solace in more drinks, further impairing their memory and complicating their emotional state. The description of the characters' interactions and the setting reveals a complex dynamic among them, and the overwhelming influence of alcohol plays a crucial role in the unfolding events. The narrator's inability to clearly remember the happenings highlights the impairing effect of excessive drinking, and it supports the response \\"They had too much to drink\\" as the reason behind the blurred memories and unclear recollections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"Among the most common types of malware are Trojans, worms, and viruses. Trojans, named after the infamous Greek mythological story of the Trojan horse, are malicious programs that disguise themselves as legitimate or useful software. Once installed on a user's system, they allow cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or take control of the victim's device. Some common examples of Trojan threats include banking Trojans, remote access Trojans (RATs), and ransomware Trojans. Trojans typically spread through phishing attacks, fraudulent emails, software downloads, and malicious websites. Worms, like viruses, are self-replicating malware that spread quickly through a network without requiring user interaction. The primary difference between worms and viruses is that worms do not need to attach themselves to an existing program to propagate. They exploit security vulnerabilities in systems, software, or network protocols, such as weak or default passwords and outdated software or plugins. Once a worm infects a system, it continually seeks new targets to infect, consuming system and network resources or causing more severe damage, such as overloading servers, rendering systems inoperable, or allowing the attacker to gain control over the infected machines. Some well-known historical examples of worms include the ILOVEYOU worm, Code Red, and Slammer. Viruses, often compared to biological viruses, are malicious software programs that require manual intervention to spread. They replicate by attaching themselves to other programs and files, often hiding within commonly shared types of files, such as documents, images, and executables. When an infected file or application is run on a system, it triggers the virus's payload, which can include stealing information, corrupting or deleting files, reformatting hard drives, or creating a backdoor for further attacks. Viruses typically spread through file sharing, email attachments, or removable media, like USB drives. Some famous examples of viruses include the Melissa virus, the Anna Kournikova virus, and the occasional \\"macro\\" virus found in Microsoft Office documents. In essence, among the most prevalent types of malware are Trojans, worms, and viruses, each with distinct methods of infiltration and potential for damage to a user's system. Mitigating the risks associated with these threats often involves regularly updating software and operating systems, using strong and unique passwords, installing a reputable antivirus program, and being cautious when downloading files or interacting with email attachments or suspicious websites."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We will create a 2D integer matrix dp, where dp[i][j] is the length of the common substring that ends with characters A[i] and B[j]. We will initialize this matrix with all elements as 0. Then we iterate through the strings A and B to fill up the dp matrix and keep track of the maximum length found so far. Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. Initialize variables:    - Create a 2D integer matrix, dp, with dimensions (length of A + 1) x (length of B + 1)    - Initialize all elements of dp to 0    - Set maxLength to 0 (to keep track of the maximum length of the common substring)    - Set endIndex to -1 (to keep track of the ending index of the longest common substring in string A) 2. Iterate through each character in strings A and B:    - If A[i - 1] == B[j - 1], set dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1    - If dp[i][j] > maxLength, update maxLength = dp[i][j] and endIndex = i - 1 3.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match.  A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it.  The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.  There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath.

Ian had a great credit history but Benjamin did not, so  Possible answers: a). Ian had to buy the house alone.; b). Benjamin had to buy the house alone.;","output":"Ian had always been diligent about maintaining a good credit score. He paid his bills on time, never took out too many loans, and kept a close eye on his spending. This had served him well over the years and allowed him to have many opportunities that others might not have had access to. Along with Ian, his close friend Benjamin had always dreamed of purchasing a home, yet Benjamin's credit history was not as stellar.  Despite their differences in credit history, Ian and Benjamin decided to explore their options for purchasing a home together. They began searching for properties and attended open houses, researching the process and determining a budget they both felt comfortable with. They discussed compromises and priorities, wanting to make sure they found a house that could become a home for both of them. They soon found a beautiful property that they both loved. It was within their budget and located in a peaceful neighborhood. It fulfilled all the desires they had for a shared home and more. The excitement of finding the perfect house led them to the point of discussing how to secure a mortgage loan. They were aware of their different credit histories and knew that the process of obtaining a mortgage together wouldn't be smooth. After consulting with a mortgage broker and discussing their options, they learned that Ian's strong credit history could make him eligible for a lower interest rate and better loan terms. On the other hand, Benjamin's weaker credit history could potentially hinder the process and lead to higher interest rates. With this knowledge, Ian and Benjamin had a difficult decision to make. When making this decision, they considered the implications of each scenario and how it might affect both of them in the long run. They ultimately chose the option that would be financially advantageous for both parties. So, the possible answer is: a). Ian had to buy the house alone. After carefully weighing the options, Ian chose to buy the house himself, with the understanding that Benjamin would contribute to the mortgage payments and expenses as a tenant. This allowed them to secure a mortgage with more favorable terms and avoid the drawbacks of Benjamin's less-than-perfect credit history. The friends knew that they had to make a practical decision, even if this meant that Ian would be the sole homeowner. As they moved forward, Ian and Benjamin looked forward to creating new memories in their shared home, just as they had always dreamed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Odissi (Odia: odd'ishii Odisi), also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha - an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. After 12th-century, Odia temples, monasteries and nearby institutions such as the Nalanda in eastern Indian subcontinent came under waves of attacks and ransacking by Muslim armies, a turmoil that impacted all arts and eroded the freedoms previously enjoyed by performance artists. The official records of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq's invasion in Odisha (1360-1361 CE), for example, describe the destruction of the Jagannath temple as well as numerous other temples, defacing of dancing statues, and ruining of dance halls. This led to a broad decline in Odissi and other religious arts, but there were some benevolent rulers in this period who supported arts particularly through performances at courts. During the Sultanate and Mughal era of India, the temple dancers were moved to entertain the Sultan's family and courts. They became associated with concubinage to the nobility.  The Odissi dance likely expanded in the 17th century, states Alexandra Carter, under King Ramachandradeva's patronage. This expansion integrated martial arts (akhanda) and athletics into Odissi dance, by engaging boys and youth called Gotipuas, as a means to physically train the young for the military and to resist foreign invasions. According to Ragini Devi, historical evidence suggests that the Gotipuas tradition was known and nurtured in the 14th century, by Raja of Khurda.  During the British Raj, the officials of the colonial government ridiculed the temple traditions, while Christian missionaries launched a sustained attack on the moral outrage of sensuousness of Odissi and other Hindu temple dance arts. In 1872, a British civil servant named William Hunter watched a performance at the Jagannath temple in Puri, then wrote, \\"Indecent ceremonies disgraced the ritual, and dancing girls with rolling eyes put the modest worshipper to the blush...\\", and then attacked them as idol-worshipping prostitutes who expressed their devotion with \\"airy gyrations\\".  Christian missionaries launched the \\"anti-dance movement\\" in 1892, to ban all such dance forms. The dancers were dehumanized and stigmatized as prostitutes during the British period. In 1910, the British colonial government in India banned temple dancing, and the dance artists were reduced to abject poverty from the lack of any financial support for performance arts, combined with stereotyping stigma.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The life-long benefits of teaching children good money habits make it well worth the effort. Children who are not taught these lessons pay the consequences for a life time. Some parents don't teach children about money because they think they shouldn't talk about money with children, don't have the time, or think they don't have enough money. Parents should take the time to teach children about money regardless of their income and should start when children are young. Most people have strong feelings and opinions about money, based on childhood experiences and the values and beliefs of their families. Most often, these experiences, values, and beliefs are different for each parent. It is important for the healthy development of children that parents talk about these feelings and opinions and establish a consistent approach to teaching children about money. Here are some guidelines parents can keep in mind as they begin the financial socialization of their children: Advise rather than order how the child's money should be used. Allow children to learn by mistakes and by successes. Be consistent while taking children's differences into account. Include all family members in money management discussions, decision making, and activities suitable for their age. Explan to children what they can and cannot do and the consequences of going above the limits. As children get older increasingly include them in discussions of limits and consequences. Expect all family members to perform unpaid, routine household work based on their abilities. Express your desire to have things you can't afford. Children need to know that parents say \\"no\\" to themselves, too. Question: The writer believes that if children don't learn good money habits, they  _  .

And that was what their life revolved around, really.\\"Drake lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £238 in 2018). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone.

PUBLISHED:. 18:16 EST, 14 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 18:49 EST, 14 September 2013. Damning: Vicky Pryce says it is a 'myth' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the Government. Nick Clegg's plans for a ‘mansion tax’ have been savaged by Vicky Pryce – former wife of disgraced Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne. Ms Pryce says it is a ‘myth’ that taxing homes worth more than £2 million will be a ‘magic source of income’ for the Government. Her intervention comes as Lib Dems this week prepare to reaffirm their support for the tax – which is also backed by Labour – at their annual conference in Glasgow. But Ms Pryce, who will attend the conference, dismisses the whole idea of a mansion tax, which has been blocked by the Conservatives. In an article for today’s Mail on Sunday, she says: ‘It is a tax that is set at an arbitrary level with no  economic justification for that level or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money’ and ‘a mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just waiting to be tapped’. Ms Pryce also pointedly disagrees with her friend Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, who has raised fears that Coalition plans for low-deposit mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble. ‘There are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by Vince Cable no less – but I don’t share them,’ she says. The remarks came as Mr Clegg last night opened the Glasgow rally with a plea for party unity. He sought to placate members over sharing power with David Cameron by branding the Tories the ‘fire at will’ party for wanting to cut workers’ rights. But respected Lib Dem peer Tony. Greaves accused Mr Clegg of trying to blackmail his party into sticking. with Tory-inspired austerity measures in a crunch vote tomorrow. The. Deputy Prime Minister will speak in a conference motion on the economy. in a bid to ensure members do not oppose Coalition spending cuts. But. Lord Greaves said: ‘Presumably they were frightened they were going to. lose – but it’s blackmail. It’s turning the debate into a vote of. confidence in the leader.’ Ex-husband: Pryce was married to former British Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne. The two were jailed in March after they falsely told police she had been driving when his car was caught by a speed camera. Unity: Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem Leader Nick Clegg called for party unity at the opening of today's conference. Vince Cable will tomorrow delight activists by vowing to crack down on ‘rotten’ company directors by beefing up the law. The Business Secretary will unveil plans to make it easier to ban rogue directors from running firms. He will also announce help for people to get compensation where they have suffered a financial loss from a director’s ‘reckless’ behaviour. Mr Cable, left, said: ‘For too long, a small rotten core [of directors] has got away with a slap on the wrist, a ban from working in the industry or a time-limited ban. I want to beef up the laws to ban them from running British companies.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.  Paragraph: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, ginger or bananas?

Please answer the following question: Given the background: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13  cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.  and the situation: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology.  Answer the following question: Which person learned more about isostasy? Answer:","output":"Based on the background and specialization of Barry and Will, it can be inferred that Barry learned more about isostasy than Will. Isostasy is the equilibrium maintained between the Earth's lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere, with the lithosphere \\"floating\\" on the more fluid asthenosphere due to its buoyancy. It plays a significant role in the processes associated with the formation, spreading, and eventual destruction of oceanic crust. Barry's specialization in subduction zones and new seafloor is closely related to the concept of isostasy. As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge, it slowly cools over time, and older seafloor becomes colder and denser than the new seafloor. This density difference, combined with the principle of isostasy, leads to older oceanic basins being deeper than new oceanic basins. Furthermore, the process of subduction, where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust, is a mechanism that maintains isostatic equilibrium as new crust is created at spreading ridges. On the other hand, Will's specialization in montology, the study of mountains, may involve knowledge of isostasy, as mountain-building processes often result from tectonic activities and isostatic adjustments. However, considering the specific information given in the background, Barry's field of study deals with isostasy more directly. He would have a more comprehensive understanding of the various processes and their consequences, such as changes in oceanic basin depth and adjustments in the Earth's crust related to the formation and destruction of oceanic crust. In conclusion, while both geologists might have some understanding of isostasy, Barry's specialization in subduction zones and new seafloor would likely give him a more in-depth and practical knowledge of isostasy compared to Will, who specializes in montology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She wanted to go to Beijing to watch the 2008 Olympics. Only one month ago, Lamu still thought it would be difficult. In the past Tibet had no railroad  . If Lamu took a bus, it would take her a long time to reach Beijing. And a plane ticket would cost lots of money. However, things changed for Lamu. She was able to buy a ticket to the world's highest railroad. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway had been completed! The 1,142-kilometer railroad runs on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau  . Lamu could reach Beijing by train in 48 hours! About 550 kilometers of the railroad are constructed on the frozen earth  . When the frozen earth warms in summer, it can move the track. But Chinese scientists have built a special structure to solve the problem. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been designed with the wild animals in the designers' minds. It also has special underpasses   for animals like Tibetan antelopes   to go through. \\"The new railroad greatly helps Tibet's tourism,\\"said Liu Yueqin, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  . As more tourists take trains to Tibet, there are more money for Tibetans. With the money, more kids can go to school. The railroad also makes things less expensive in Tibet. Now one can buy a TV set for about 1,500 yuan. It used to be much higher than that price. When there was no railroad, it had been difficult to send things in and out of Tibet.

He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history.  Which era would more likely be shorter, era A or era B?","output":"To determine which era is likely to be shorter, let's analyze the given information step-by-step: Step 1: Understanding the time periods - Era A refers to the time when dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. - Era B refers to the time period around the mass extinction, which happened 66 million years ago. Step 2: Analyze the time periods - Era A covers the entire time in which dinosaurs were flourishing, which includes the beginnings of their evolution, their dominance on Earth, and their diversification. This time span is likely to be quite long as it accommodates the entire history of dinosaurs up until the mass extinction event. - Era B refers to a specific event - the mass extinction that occurred around 66 million years ago. It is likely to be a relatively short time period or moment in geological time when the extinction event took place. Considering the analysis, Era A is likely to be much longer than Era B, as it involves the entire history of dinosaurs. In contrast, Era B is focused on the time around the mass extinction event, which is a specific point or relatively shorter period in geological time. Therefore, it can be concluded that Era B is more likely to be shorter compared to Era A."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"What helps an animal move through a river better?\\" and the following answer choices:  - salinity  - scales  - long snout  - long tail  - contracting  - stamina  - long fur  - four limbs  Now knowing that along tail can be used to move through water by an animal and water remains in the current of the river, choose the best answer. Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What helps an animal move through a river better?\\" is - long tail. A long tail is highly beneficial for animals moving through a river, as it provides enhanced maneuverability and stability in the water. The tails act as rudders, enabling animals to steer and control their direction while swimming. Additionally, a long tail offers a means for propulsion in animals like crocodiles and some fish species. This combination of maneuverability, stability, and propulsion enables these animals to navigate a river effectively. While other answer choices listed have particular advantages for different animals, such as stamina for long-distance swimmers and four limbs for animals that need to move in and out of the water easily, these attributes do not have as direct and comprehensive impact on an animal's ability to move through a river as a long tail would. Salinity, while an important factor for aquatic animals, is not directly related to physical movement for most animals. Scales provide protection and help reduce friction for animals, but their contribution to movement is limited. A long snout can help some animals catch prey or find food in the river, but it is not directly involved in locomotion. Contracting could refer to the contraction of muscles for movement, but without further context, this option doesn't provide a clear advantage to movement in a river. Long fur, on the other hand, can be detrimental for animals moving through water, as it can add weight and resistance, making it difficult for animals to swim efficiently. Thus, the most suitable answer to the given question is a long tail, as it directly contributes to an animal's ability to navigate and move through a river effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: Why was Patch hungry? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"Patch, the young squirrel, was hungry due to a culmination of various environmental aspects that led to a scarcity of food. It was the end of a long and severe winter, which is a season where food sources for squirrels are inherently scarce due to the harsh weather conditions. As climate changes from autumn to winter, trees stop producing fruits and nuts, bugs and grubs burrow deep into the soil, and green vegetation becomes sparse or disappears completely. This time of the season makes it extremely challenging for animals like squirrels, who rely predominantly on these kinds of food, to satisfy their hunger. In specific reference to Patch's situation, there were a couple of notable factors contributing to his hunger. Firstly, the cherry and maple trees in his habitat, Central Park, had not started producing buds yet. Buds can serve as a source of food for squirrels. Similarly, flowers, another food source, had not begun to grow either, which further limited his food options. Secondly, it was mentioned that the juicy grubs and bugs of spring, which are a primary protein source for squirrels, had not yet emerged from the winter siesta, meaning the availability of such food was nil. Moreover, it was also highlighted that Patch had not found a nut, an essential part of a squirrel's diet, in two days. Generally, squirrels store food like acorns, seeds, and nuts for the winter months, but it's possible that his supplies might have been exhausted due to the prolonged winter. So, Patch's hunger was due to the unavailability of his typical food sources such as buds, flowers, grubs, bugs, and nuts, given the harsh winter season and the slow onset of spring. As a result, he was compelled to venture out into the cold in a desperate quest for food, despite his better judgement to stay home and sleep because of the cold&nbsp;weather."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Editor Pete Muir said the survey had looked at a variety of factors  from gym membership to heart disease rates to find the fattest city. \\"Manchester has more fast food restaurants than anywhere else in the UK,\\" he told Reuters. \\"People are taking the easy choice --eating and then just sitting in front of the TV.\\" Manchester's problem is part of a wider trend . On Thursday, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) blamed  a lack of exercise and poor diet for a fifth of adult Britons being obese . \\"Obesity is a major risky factor related to heart disease, diabetes and premature death ,\\" said an ONS survey. \\"None of the 108 young men in the survey reported eating five portions of fruit or vegetables on average each day.\\" In Manchester, the head of the city's public health programs said he did not believe that they were necessarily the fattest city, but that they did have problems and were aiming to address them.

I got lost when the","output":"GPS signal dropped, but thankfully, I had taken a few precautionary measures to ensure I could still find my way back. As I mentioned earlier, I had both a physical map and the GPS to guide me. When the GPS signal dropped unexpectedly, likely due to tall buildings or dense foliage obstructing the satellite reception, it left me feeling disoriented and unsure of which direction to head. At first, I panicked, not knowing where I was or how to get back on track. The unfamiliar surroundings added to my unease, making it difficult for me to gather my bearings and find some semblance of a location marker. However, remembering that I had brought my trusty map as a backup, I pulled it out of my backpack and started studying the topography and landmarks to identify my approximate location. In the absence of a working GPS, I relied on my map-reading skills, taking note of intersections and landmarks to determine the best route back home. One of the key challenges of navigating without the aid of GPS was estimating the distances between various points on the map. However, I understood that it was a valuable skill to develop, and so I mentally calculated the approximate distance I had traveled based on the map's scale. By doing so, I was able to estimate the remaining distance and approximate the time it would take to reach my destination. As I continued to follow the map, I also decided to pay closer attention to my surroundings – observing the streets, buildings, and natural landmarks. This helped me stay alert and aware of any possible discrepancies between the map and the real world. This vigilance proved to be useful when I encountered a construction site that had temporarily closed off a section of the road. By remaining observant and constantly cross-referencing my map, I was able to find an alternate route and bypass the obstacle without much difficulty. Along the way, I interacted with some friendly locals who kindly offered directions and confirmed parts of my planned route. While relying on strangers can be risky, I found that it was helpful to gather information from different sources and cross-check it against my map and personal judgment. Throughout the rest of my journey home, I maintained a steady pace and followed my improvised plan accordingly. Although the trip took longer than expected, I managed to find my way back home without any major difficulty or incidents. I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment and newfound confidence in my ability to navigate unfamiliar situations without the aid of modern technology. In conclusion, my experience of getting lost when the GPS signal dropped taught me valuable lessons in relying on multiple sources for navigation, trusting in my own instincts, and developing a better understanding of my surroundings. It highlighted the importance of being prepared for unexpected situations and embracing the challenges that come with stepping outside of our comfort zones. While technology undoubtedly plays a crucial role in simplifying navigation, developing and maintaining traditional map-reading and problem-solving skills are invaluable assets for any traveler."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Write an article with the title: \\"Donald Trump Nuclear Bomb Ad in Ohio\\"","output":"Title: \\"Donald Trump Nuclear Bomb Ad in Ohio\\" Introduction In the midst of a highly contentious election season in the United States, the Trump campaign is working to secure votes in key battleground states, notably Ohio. Drawing attention to national security concerns, the campaign has released a provocative advertisement centered around nuclear weapons. This article explores the content and implications of Donald Trump's nuclear bomb ad targeted at Ohio voters. Step 1: Describe the advertisement The ad, which first aired on local television stations and was later shared across social media platforms, features a series of black and white images with dramatic music in the background. The opening image shows a mushroom cloud – a symbol of a nuclear explosion – superimposed on a map of the United States with the phrase \\"Trump will keep America safe\\" written in bold letters. Step 2: Explain the message of the advertisement One critical theme of the advertisement is emphasizing the importance of national security amidst geopolitical tensions and potential threats from hostile actors. By unapologetically brandishing the notion of strong nuclear capabilities, the Trump campaign seeks to assure voters that Donald Trump is the only candidate equipped to handle these complex and potentially deadly threats. Step 3: Analyze the potential impact on Ohio voters The decision to target Ohio with this particular ad is deliberate. As a swing state, Ohio is often a deciding factor in presidential elections, with its 18 electoral votes highly coveted by both parties. While it is evident that the Trump campaign is attempting to use this advertisement to sway undecided voters, it remains unclear what the exact impact will be, given the polarized atmosphere surrounding the 2020 election. Step 4: Discuss public reactions to the ad The Trump nuclear bomb ad has elicited both support and criticism from Ohio residents and the general public alike. Supporters of the President argue that the ad demonstrates strong leadership and a commitment to national security. Critics, on the other hand, denounce the ad as fear-mongering and a potentially reckless message that could further escalate global tensions. Step 5: Contextualize the ad in broader political discourse In conclusion, the Donald Trump nuclear bomb ad in Ohio is just one example of the high-stakes messaging employed by political campaigns in the United States. With tensions around national security and foreign policy playing a significant role in voters' decisions, both the Trump and Biden campaigns will continue to leverage these topics in an effort to connect with their respective voter bases and win crucial electoral votes. As the election day draws near, political advertising will undoubtedly become even more persuasive and dramatic, and its impacts on voters remain to be seen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The US whistleblower’s comments, made in an interview with the Guardian, came as supporters, including his US lawyer, stepped up a campaign for a presidential pardon. Snowden is wanted in the US, where he is accused of violating the Espionage Act and faces at least 30 years in jail. Speaking on Monday via a video link from Moscow, where he is in exile, Snowden said any evaluation of the consequences of his leak of tens of thousands of National Security Agency and GCHQ documents in 2013 would show clearly that people had benefited. “Yes, there are laws on the books that say one thing, but that is perhaps why the pardon power exists – for the exceptions, for the things that may seem unlawful in letters on a page but when we look at them morally, when we look at them ethically, when we look at the results, it seems these were necessary things, these were vital things,” he said. “I think when people look at the calculations of benefit, it is clear that in the wake of 2013 the laws of our nation changed. The [US] Congress, the courts and the president all changed their policies as a result of these disclosures. At the same time there has never been any public evidence that any individual came to harm as a result.” Although US presidents have granted some surprising pardons when leaving office, the chances of Obama doing so seem remote, even though before he entered the White House he was a constitutional lawyer who often made the case for privacy and had warned about the dangers of mass surveillance. Obama’s former attorney general Eric Holder, however, gave an unexpected boost to the campaign for a pardon in May when he said Snowden had performed a public service. The campaign could receive a further lift from Oliver Stone’s film, Snowden, scheduled for release in the US on Friday. Over the weekend the director said he hoped the film would help shift opinion behind the whistleblower, and added his voice to the plea for a pardon. Ahead of general release, the film will be shown in 700 cinemas across the US on Wednesday, with plans for Stone and Snowden to join in a discussion afterwards via a video link. In his wide-ranging interview, Snowden insisted the net public benefit of the NSA leak was clear. “If not for these disclosures, if not for these revelations, we would be worse off,” he said. In Hong Kong in June 2013, when he had passed his documents to journalists, Snowden displayed an almost unnatural calm, as if resigned to his fate. On Monday he said that at that time he expected a “dark end” in which he was either killed or jailed in the US. More than three years on, he appears cheerful and relaxed. He has avoided the fate of fellow whistleblower Chelsea Manning, who is in solitary confinement in the US. Snowden is free to communicate with supporters and chats online late into the night. His 2.3 million followers on Twitter give him a huge platform to express his views. He works on tools to try to help journalists. He is not restricted to Moscow and has travelled around Russia, and his family in the US have been to visit him. But Snowden still wants to return to the US and seems confident, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, that it will happen. “In the fullness of time, I think I will end up back home,” he said. “Once the officials, who felt like they had to protect the programmes, their positions, their careers, have left government and we start looking at things from a more historical perspective, it will be pretty clear that this war on whistleblowers does not serve the interests of the United States; rather it harms them.” Snowden attracts lots of conspiracy theories. Early on, he was accused of being a spy for China and then a Russian spy. In August a cryptic tweet followed by an unusual absence prompted speculation that he was dead. He said he had simply gone on holiday. The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated. pic.twitter.com/ZgIkapmcOC There had also been rumours that his partner, Lindsay Mills, had left him, which would have been embarrassing as their romance occupies a large part of the Stone film. Snowden said “she is with me and we are very happy”. His revelations resulted in a global debate and modest legislative changes. More significant, perhaps, is that surveillance and the impact of technological change has seeped into popular culture, in films such as the latest Jason Bourne and television series’, such as the Good Wife. Snowden also welcomed “a renaissance of scepticism” on the part of at least some journalists when confronted by anonymous briefings by officials not backed by evidence. He warned three years ago of the danger that one day there might be a president who abused the system. The warning failed to gain much traction, given that Obama’s presidency seemed relatively benign. But it resonates more today, in the wake of Donald Trump’s response to the Russian hacking of the Democratic party: that he wished he had the power to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails. If Obama, as seems likely, declines to pardon Snowden, his chances under either Clinton or Trump would seem to be even slimmer. He described the 2016 presidential race as unprecedented “in terms of the sort of authoritarian policies that are being put forward”. “Unfortunately, many candidates in the political mainstream today, even pundits and commentators who aren’t running for office, believe we have to be able to do anything, no matter what, as long as there is some benefit to be had in doing so. But that is the logic of a police state.” He is even less impressed by the British prime minister, referring to Theresa May as a “a sort of Darth Vader in the United Kingdom”, whose surveillance bill is “an egregious violation of human rights, that goes far further than any law proposed in the western world”. Snowden was initially berated by opponents for failing to criticise the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but he has become increasingly vocal. It is a potentially risky move, given his application for an extension of asylum is up for renewal next year, so why do it? “Well, it would not be the first time I have taken a risk for something I believe in,” he said. “This is a complex situation. Russia is not my area of focus. It is not my area of expertise. I don’t speak Russian in a fluent manner that I could really participate in and influence policy. But when something happens that I believe is clearly a violation of the right thing, I believe we should stand up and say something about it. “My priority always has to be my own country rather than Russia. I would like to help reform the human rights situation in Russia but I will never be well placed to do so relative to actual Russian activists themselves.” Might he end up as part of a US-Russian prisoner exchange, with Putin possibly more amenable to the idea if Trump was in power? “There has always been the possibility that any government could say, ‘Well, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of human rights, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of law, it will be beneficial to use this individual as a bargaining chip’. This is not exclusive to me. This happens to activists around the world every day.” He said he saw the Stone film as a mechanism for getting people to talk about surveillance, though he felt uncomfortable with other people telling his story. Snowden has toyed with writing his memoirs but has not made much progress. There are at least three books about him on the way; an extensively researched one by the Washington Post’s Bart Gellman and two others thought to be hostile. Asked if he was the source for the Panama Papers – the comments by the source sound like Snowden – he laughed. He praised the biggest data leak in history, adding that he would normally be happy to cloak other whistleblowers by neither denying nor confirming he was a source. But he would make an exception in the case of the Panama Papers. “I would not claim any credit for that.” For someone who has spent his life trying to keep out of the public eye, he has now appeared in a Hollywood movie and an Oscar-winning documentary, and several plays, including Privacy, which just ended a run in New York and in which he has a part alongside Daniel Radcliffe. “It was an alarming experience for me. I am not an actor. I have been told I am not very good at it. But you know if I can, I can try and maybe it will help, I will give it my best shot.” For Snowden, his campaign for a pardon, even if forlorn, offers a chance to highlight his plight, and he expressed thanks to all those who were backing it. He also said he hoped that after the fuss of the movie he could finally fade into the background. “I really hope it is over,” he said. “That would be the greatest gift anyone could give me.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article primarily focuses on the plea made by Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA), for a presidential pardon from Barack Obama before he leaves office in January. Snowden argues that his disclosure of mass surveillance by the US and British intelligence agencies was not only legally defensible but has also benefitted the wider public. Snowden is sought in the US on charges of violating the Espionage Act, which could lead to a 30+ year prison sentence. He has been living in exile in Russia, which is where he made his recent comments via a video interview with The Guardian. He claimed that an assessment of the effects of his leak would clearly demonstrate that the public has gained from the exposure of thousands of confidential NSA and GCHQ documents in 2013. He presented his actions as morally and ethically necessary, despite their departure from existing laws. Snowden highlighted the subsequent changes in national policies and laws brought about by his disclosures, stressing that there's no tangible proof that his actions caused harm to any individual. The likelihood of Obama granting Snowden a pardon seems slim, but former Attorney General Eric Holder did express that Snowden had performed a public service. The campaign for Snowden's pardon might gain some momentum from the release of Oliver Stone’s film, Snowden, as Stone hopes the film would shift public opinion in Snowden's favor. Snowden revealed his desire to return to the US and his belief that he eventually will, despite the obstacles in his path. He also expressed his confidence that the 'war on whistleblowers' would eventually be recognized as harmful to US interests.  Throughout the article, Snowden appeared at ease and in high spirits despite his circumstances. The article concluded with Snowden thanking his supporters and expressing his hope for the future. Despite his plea for a pardon seeming unlikely to succeed, he believes it raises awareness about his situation and hopes that he could fade into the background once the popularity surrounding the movie ends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated  since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well. Question: What type of writing does this passage belong to?

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

Here is the step-by-step process to achieve this: 1. Initialize a variable \`sum\` to store the sum of numerical elements. 2. Use a for loop to iterate through the list A from position i to position j (inclusive). 3. Check if the current element is a numerical value by using the \`str.isdigit()\` method.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command.

During the G1 phase, it is synthesized rapidly and accumulates in the nucleus, and is degraded as the cell enters the S phase. Cyclin D1 is a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. The protein dimerizes with CDK4/6 to regulate the G1/S phase transition and entry into the S-phase.

It plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle by associating with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6, forming active kinase complexes. These complexes facilitate the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase by phosphorylating retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, which results in the release of E2F transcription factors.

All have been shot in the chest and mouth; their faces and fingerprints have been completely removed. Renko is left anxious and paranoid when the KGB refuse to take over the investigation. Renko enlists the help of Professor Andreev (Ian McDiarmid) to reconstruct their faces. At a weekend getaway at the dacha of Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy (Ian Bannen), Renko makes the acquaintance of the American sable importer Jack Osborne (Lee Marvin) and his girlfriend Irina Asanova (Joanna PacuÅa). During his investigation, Renko crosses paths with William Kirwill (Brian Dennehy), a New York detective who is in the Soviet Union investigating the disappearance of his brother James. Renko is eventually able to piece together the victims' identities: James Kirwill, and two young Russians who were friends of Irina. He discovers that the three were busy constructing a chest for Osborne. Renko's suspicion of Osborne mounts over time, during their polite but tense conversations in social settings. When Irina is attacked by a KGB officer who attempts to inject her with a fatal overdose, Renko saves her. Nursing her back to health in his apartment, they begin an affair.

Despite her many challenges, Sawako's extraordinary talents are unveiled throughout the movie, which ultimately changes her life and the lives of those around her, forever. Detailed Plot: Act One: Our story begins in the quaint, picturesque town of Sagayama, where we meet Sawako Kuronuma, a shy and introverted high school girl who struggles to make friends and connect with her peers. Sawako is often misunderstood by her classmates due to her unique appearance and her uncanny resemblance to the eerie protagonist from the famous horror film \\"The Ring.\\" This has earned her the nickname 'Sadako,' which she's never liked, but feels powerless to change. As the school year progresses, Sawako is paired with a group of students, including the school's most popular boy, Kazehaya, and her bright and bubbly future best friend, Yukari, for a school project. While the classmates initially judge Sawako by her appearance, they soon come to realize that she's a genuinely kind-hearted and talented individual. Act Two: Inspired by her newfound friends, Sawako slowly starts to gain confidence in herself. It becomes apparent that she has a unique ability to communicate and empathize with animals. Wanting to expand her horizons, Sawako joins the school's animal-care club which enables her to shine and display her true passions. At one point, an unfortunate event occurs when the school's beloved mascot, a rescued dog named Koro, goes missing. Sawako leads her group of friends on a mission to rescue the lost dog. She uses her ability to understand and empathize with animals to connect with Koro, who is also misunderstood and isolated, just like her. Act Three: During the climactic scene, Sawako and her friends eventually find Koro trapped in a dangerous situation involving a landslide at the outskirts of the town. Sawako's unique talents, incredible courage, and persistence are instrumental in rescuing the dog, overcoming her fears, and saving the day. News of Sawako's heroism spreads throughout the school and the town of Sagayama. Her once misunderstanding classmates come to appreciate her incredible gifts, and Sawako is finally recognized for her incredible personality and wonderful talents that had been hidden beneath her shy exterior. Epilogue: As the movie concludes, Sawako has now found her place at high school and is enjoying her life as a regular teenage girl, surrounded by supportive friends - both human and animal - who love her for who she truly is. We see a transformed Sawako, finally comfortable in her own skin, who now serves as an inspiration and role model to her peers, proving that embracing one's true self and unique talents can make the world a better place. \\"The Unveiling of Sawako Kuronuma\\" is a heartwarming movie that not only highlights the importance of true friendship and courage but also showcases the profound impact that compassion and understanding can have on one's life and the lives of others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick your answer from: a. no; b. yes;","output":"a. no While both questions involve the hypothetical scenario of the United States ceasing to exist or collapsing, they differ in the perspectives and outcomes they explore. I will address each question separately for a comprehensive understanding. 1. What would happen if the United States went away tomorrow? The sudden disappearance of the United States would have far-reaching consequences on a global scale. Here are some of the potential impacts: a) Economic impact: The United States has the world's largest economy, accounting for nearly a quarter of global GDP. Its absence would cause considerable disruption to the global economic order. Stock markets would plummet, supply chains would be disrupted, and investments would halt. A new economic power would need to rise and restore balance, but this process would likely take years. b) Military impact: Being the most powerful military force globally, the collapse of the United States would create a power vacuum that could lead to instability and potentially an increase in armed conflicts. Nations with significant military influence, such as China and Russia, might try to assert their dominance or expand their territories. Additionally, US allies depending upon American military support for protection would feel vulnerable. c) Political impact: Countries that closely align themselves with the United States diplomatically, such as NATO allies or Japan and South Korea, would experience a significant loss of influence. Conversely, countries politically opposed to the United States, like Iran and North Korea, could take advantage of the power vacuum and gain regional supremacy. d) Cultural impact: American culture has an immense influence worldwide, evident through the popularity of film, music, fashion, and literature. The sudden disappearance of the United States could create a cultural void leading to shifts in the global cultural dynamic. 2. Would the rest of the world rejoice if America collapses? The global reaction to the collapse of the United States would likely vary significantly based on each country's relationship with the US and their respective geopolitical interests. Some nations might see this as an opportunity to strengthen their influence and expand their territories, while others might lament the loss of a significant political, economic, and military ally. It is important to note that the demise of any major global power, in this case, the United States, would undoubtedly lead to a prolonged period of instability, economic turmoil, and unpredictable shifts in power dynamics. Many countries may be adversely affected by this change, regardless of their current relationship with the United States. In conclusion, while both questions explore the idea of the United States collapsing, the first question focuses on the outcomes of such an event, whereas the second question investigates the possible emotional reactions from other nations.

The plaintiffs are Michele Reinhart of Missoula and Jean Price of Great Falls, both Democratic representatives in Montana. Alexander Blewett III, a Helena-based attorney, said the intent is to eventually open up the suit to anyone who'd bought a book by Mortenson or donated to the Montana-based charity he heads. He said the two plaintiffs hope is to collect money, should the lawsuit prevail, and use it to spur educational efforts in Afghanistan, as the charity has purported to do. \\"The conduct of Mortenson and OPTIONS: - 60 Minutes constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Afghanistan constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Alexander Blewett III constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Anders Blewett constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - CNN constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Central Asia Institute constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Democratic constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Great Falls constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Greg Mortenson constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Helena constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Jean Price constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Michele Reinhart constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Missoula constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Montana constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Mortenson constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit. - Three Cups of Tea constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit.","output":"\\"The conduct of Mortenson and Central Asia Institute constitutes malice and/or other egregious conduct, for which a jury should award punitive damages,\\" according to the lawsuit.

What is the answer?","output":"The 1970 hit for the Kinks that was about a young man's experience with a transvestite in a bar is \\"Lola.\\" This song was written by Ray Davies, the lead singer, and main songwriter of the Kinks, and was released on June 12, 1970. The song appeared on their album \\"Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One,\\" which was their eighth studio album. \\"Lola\\" tells the story of a young man who meets a person named Lola in a club and becomes attracted to her, only to realize later that Lola is a transvestite. The song's catchy chorus goes: \\"Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy, but when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola. La-la-la-la Lola.\\" The song has been praised for its open-mindedness and its non-judgmental approach to a topic that was considered quite controversial at the time. The lyrics speak about gender fluidity, transgender identity, and even cross-dressing, which were not commonly discussed or accepted subjects in the mainstream culture during the early 1970s. The inspiration for \\"Lola\\" came from Ray Davies' real-life experiences. According to him, he based the story on an encounter that the band's manager, Robert Wace, had with a transvestite in a Parisian club called the \\"Castille.\\" However, over the years, various interpretations and stories have arisen, attributing the inspiration for the song to different members of the band or people in their entourage. When \\"Lola\\" was released, it was met with both success and controversy. The song reached number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in the United States and number two on the UK Singles Chart. However, due to the subject matter, it faced bans on some radio stations and faced scrutiny from conservative groups. The BBC initially banned the song because of its mention of the brand name \\"Coca-Cola,\\" and it was only played on the radio after the lyric was changed to \\"cherry cola.\\" In the years since its release, \\"Lola\\" has become not only a signature song for the Kinks but also an anthem for the LGBTQ+ community. The song's frank, open discussion of gender identity helped to break down the barriers and fostered greater understanding and acceptance for the transgender community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The days of Europeans relaxing in the cafe with a newspaper and a seemingly endless cup of coffee appear to be numbered.A new English expression is popular in Europe these days:\\"coffee to go.\\" \\"Five or ten years ago it was much more normal to sit in a cafe for several hours than it is nowadays,\\"says Joann,who works in a central Berlin coffee bar owned by the Canadian coffee and bakery chain Tim's. \\"There is a trend towards a more fast-paced life.But people still act surprised  when you ask if the coffee is'to go'.You mean I can take it with me? they ask..\\" \\"Europe is often five or eight years behind trends in America,\\"says Joann.\\"In the States.'coffee to go'is part of everyday life.\\" Owing in part to Starbucks,it appears to be very much part of everyday life in many other countries too. The Seattle-based group compete with a growing number of global chains in attempting to reshape coffee drinking cultures in regions including Asia and the Middle East. The US is the model for continental Europe's new\\"coffee to go\\"culture:Each of the new cafe bars offers bagels,muffins,brownies and cookies to go with the coffee. But then,\\"coffee to go''might sound a little odd to English ears used to the words \\"takeaway\\"or take one. It does sum up the brisker pace of life since the city resumed its status as the German capital following the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. As one more sign of the changing times,one of Berlin's most venerable coffee houses,cafe Einstein,has followed the trend by opening a small chain of coffee shops across the city. Taking coffee,slowly and in decorous surroundings,has been a feature of European coffee houses,particularly in German speaking countries,for decades. For the elderly citzens of Vienna it amounts to a ritual when they gather in coffee houses around the city for a cup of their favovrite drink and a piece of rich,creamy cake.

Article: A modern-day love story of a man seeing the girl of his dreams across a New York subway train and tracking her down over the Internet has failed to have a fairytale ending with the relationship over. For Web designer Patrick Moberg, then 21, from Brooklyn, it was love at first sight when he saw a woman on a Manthttan train last November. But he lost her in the crowd so he set up a website with a sketch picture to find her--www.Nygirlofmydreams.com. Unbelievably in a city of 8 million people, it only took Moberg 48 hours to find the woman, with his phone ringing non-stop and email box overflowing. New Yorkers took pity on the subway Romeo and joined his hunt. The mysterious girl was named as Camille Hayton, from Melbourne, Australia, who was working at the magazine Black Book and also lived in Brooklyn. One of her friends saw the sketched picture on the Web site and recognized her. But after finding each other, appearing on TV and getting international press, the couple took their romance out of the public eye, with Moberg closing down the Web site and with both refusing to make any more comments--until now. Hayton told Australian newspaper The Sunday Telegraph that she dated Moberg for about two months but it just didn't work out. \\"I say we dated for a while but now we're just friends,\\" Hayton, now 23, told the newspaper. Hayton said she is still recognized about three times a week on the streets of Manhattan as \\"that girl\\" and the question is always the same: \\"So what happened?\\" \\"I think the situation was so intense that it linked us,\\" she said, adding, \\"it linked us in a way that you could mistake, I guess, for being more romantic than it was. I don't know. But I wanted to give it a go so didn't wonder what if, what if?\\" Hayton told The Sunday Telegraph that she is enjoying single life in New York, keeping busy with acting classes, working in two clothing stores.

The club was located in Chicago and was a popular venue for fans of dance music, particularly within the city's African American, Latino, and LGBTQ communities. The term \\"house music\\" is derived from the club's name as the music played there evolved into a distinct genre, characterized by its repetitive beats, synthesized basslines, and soulful vocal samples. Initially, the Warehouse was most famous for the legendary DJ Frankie Knuckles, known as the \\"Godfather of House Music.\\" He was the club's resident DJ from 1977 until its closure in 1983. Knuckles's pioneering DJ techniques and innovative musical selections significantly paved the way for the development of house music as a genre and influenced countless artists and DJs in the years that followed. He would often mix in elements of soul, funk, new wave, and disco with electronic drum machines, synthesizers, and other newly emerging technology of that era. After the Warehouse closed in 1983, many of its patrons continued to follow house music, leading to the opening of several new clubs in Chicago that carried on the tradition and further popularized the sound. It was not long before the genre, which was initially a local phenomenon, quickly spread beyond the city limits and became an international movement.

This land is called Peru and it's nestled way down in South America.  One of the most special places in Peru is a city called Cuzco. Just like how your house might be the heart of your neighborhood because that's where you play, make friends, and have fun, Cuzco was the heart of the Inca Empire. The very word 'Cuzco' actually means 'navel' in the Quechua language, which was spoken by the Incas, so it can be thought of as the belly button of the ancient Inca world! Funny, isn't it?  In Cuzco, the Incas built huge rock walls, beautiful temples to show respect to their gods, and even grand palaces where their rule - the Sapa Inca, lived. And guess what, they did all these with just their bare hands and simple tools, not the big machines we have nowadays.  Now, let's hike a little bit up high into the clouds, following a secret path through the Andes mountains. Here, hidden from view under a soft blanket of green trees, lies an awesome city called Machu Picchu. Some people call it the 'Lost City,' but it's not because someone misplaced it. Rather, it was forgotten about for a long time, hidden away from the world on purpose. Machu Picchu is like a giant stone playground with more than 150 buildings – houses, baths, temples, and even a clock made by using shadows, like a giant sundial! Despite how high up it is, the Incas built this city right into the mountain; to do this, they had to be really clever and took care of the land so it wouldn't erode or slip away.  These two places - Cuzco and Machu Picchu, they tell us a story, a story of people who came before us, of their knowledge, their passions, their beliefs, and their amazing skills. So, next time when you play with your toy blocks, remember those ancient Incas, who, just like you, loved to build and create, but they did it on a much, much bigger scale.  Incredible, isn't it?

Q:The answer to the question: Besides desert parsley and California goldfields, what are the most common wildflowers that grow on the Table Rocks? is inside the article: Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains.

This is because, as stated in the paragraph, the process of diffusion is much faster in gases than in liquids. The main reason for this is that the particles in gases are further apart from each other compared to those in liquids. Due to this increased separation, gas particles have more freedom to move and mix, resulting in a faster rate of diffusion. In contrast, particles in liquids are much closer together, so they have less space to move around, and their ability to mix with other substances is limited.

Article: (Checked to delivery - published at 21:00 GMT)      Good evening London.      What a sight for sore eyes. People ask what gives me hope. Well, the answer is right here.      Six months ago – 185 days ago – I entered this building.      It has become my home, my office and my refuge.      Thanks to the principled stance of the Ecuadorian government and the support of its people, I am safe in this embassy to speak to you.      And every single day outside, for 185 days, people like you have watched over this embassy – come rain, hail and shine.      Every single day. I came here in summer. It is winter now.      I have been sustained by your solidarity and I’m grateful for the efforts of people all around the world supporting the work of WikiLeaks, supporting freedom of speech, freedom of the press, essential elements in any democracy.      While my freedom is limited, at least I am still able to communicate this Christmas, unlike the 232 journalists who are in jail tonight.      Unlike Gottfrid Svartholm in Sweden tonight.      Unlike Jeremy Hammond in New York tonight.      Unlike Nabeel Rajab in Bahrain tonight.      And unlike Bradley Manning, who turned 25 this week, a young man who has maintained his dignity after spending more than 10 per cent of his life in jail, without trial, some of that time in a cage, naked and without his glasses.      And unlike so many others whose plights are linked to my own.      I salute these brave men and women. And I salute journalists and publications that have covered what continues to happen to these people, and to journalists who continue publishing the truth in face of persecution, prosecution and threat – who take journalism and publishing seriously.      Because it is from the revelation of truth that all else follows.      Our buildings can only be as tall as their bricks are strong.      Our civilization is only as strong as its ideas are true.      When our buildings are erected by the corrupt, when their cement is cut with dirt, when pristine steel is replaced by scrap – our buildings are not safe to live in.      And when our media is corrupt, when our academics are timid, when our history is filled with half- truths and lies – our civilization will never be just. It will never reach to the sky.      Our societies are intellectual shanty towns. Our beliefs about the world and each other have been created by the same system that has lied us into repeated wars that have killed millions.      You can’t build a skyscraper out of plasticine. And you can’t build a just civilization out of ignorance and lies.      We have to educate each other. We have to celebrate those who reveal the truth and denounce those who poison our ability to comprehend the world that we live in.      The quality of our discourse is the limit of our civilization.      But this generation has come to its feet and is revolutionizing the way we see the world.      For the first time in history the people who are affected by history are its creators.      And for other journalists and publications – your work speaks for itself, and so do your war crimes.      I salute those who recognize the freedom of the press and the public's right to know – recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, recognized in the First Amendment of the United States – we must recognize that these are in danger and need protection like never before.      WikiLeaks is under a continuing Department of Justice investigation, and this fact has been recognized rightly by Ecuador and the governments of Latin America as one that materially endangers my life and my work.      Asylum is not granted on a whim, but granted on facts.      The U.S. investigation is referred to in testimony – under oath – in the U.S. courts, is admitted by the Department of Justice, and in the Washington Post just four days ago by the District Attorney of Virginia, as a fact. Its subpoenas are being litigated by our people in the U.S. courts. The Pentagon reissued its threats against me in September and claimed the very existence of WikiLeaks is an ongoing crime.      My work will not be cowed. But while this immoral investigation continues, and while the Australian government will not defend the journalism and publishing of WikiLeaks, I must remain here.      However, the door is open – and the door has always been open – for anyone who wishes to speak to me. Like you, I have not been charged with a crime. If you ever see spin that suggests otherwise, note this corruption of journalism and then go to justice4assange.com for the full facts. Tell the world the truth, and tell the world who lied to you.      Despite the limitations, despite the extra-judicial banking blockade, which circles WikiLeaks like the Cuban embargo, despite an unprecedented criminal investigation and a campaign to damage and destroy my organization, 2012 has been a huge year.      We have released nearly one million documents:      Documents relating to the unfolding war in Syria.      We have exposed the mass surveillance state in hundreds of documents from private intelligence companies.      We have released information about the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere – the symbol of the corruption of the rule of law in the West, and beyond.      We’ve won against the immoral blockade in the courts and in the European Parliament.      After a two-year fight, contributions to WikiLeaks have gone from being blockaded and tax-deductible nowhere to being tax-deductible across the entirety of the European Union and the United States.      And last week information revealed by WikiLeaks was vital – and cited in the judgment – in determining what really happened to El-Masri, an innocent European kidnapped and tortured by the CIA.      Next year will be equally busy. WikiLeaks has already over a million documents being prepared to be released, documents that affect every country in the world. Every country in this world.      And in Australia an unelected Senator will be replaced by one that is elected.      In 2013, we continue to stand up to bullies. The Ecuadorian government and the governments of Latin America have shown how co-operating through shared values can embolden governments to stand up to coercion and support self-determination. Their governments threaten no one, attack no one, send drones at no one. But together they stand strong and independent.      The tired calls of Washington powerbrokers for economic sanctions against Ecuador, simply for defending my rights, are misguided and wrong. President Correa rightly said, \\"Ecuador’s principles are not for sale.\\" We must unite together to defend the courageous people of Ecuador, to defend them against intervention in their economy and interference in their elections next year.      The power of people speaking up and resisting together terrifies corrupt and undemocratic power. So much so that ordinary people here in the West are now the enemy of governments, an enemy to be watched, an enemy to be controlled and to be impoverished.      True democracy is not the White House. True democracy is not Canberra. True democracy is the resistance of people, armed with the truth, against lies, from Tahrir to right here in London. Every day, ordinary people teach us that democracy is free speech and dissent.      For once we, the people, stop speaking out and stop dissenting, once we are distracted or pacified, once we turn away from each other, we are no longer free. For true democracy is the sum – is the sum – of our resistance.      If you don’t speak up – if you give up what is uniquely yours as a human being: if you surrender your consciousness, your independence, your sense of what is right and what is wrong, in other words – perhaps without knowing it, you become passive and controlled, unable to defend yourselves and those you love.      People often ask, \\"What can I do?\\"      The answer is not so difficult.      Learn how the world works. Challenge the statements and intentions of those who seek to control us behind a facade of democracy and monarchy.      Unite in common purpose and common principle to design, build, document, finance and defend.      Learn. Challenge. Act.      Now.

The WikiLeaks founder, who’s been granted asylum in Ecuador but can’t leave the embassy without getting arrested on British soil, gave a 12-minute speech in which he promised another big document dump next year: \\"WikiLeaks has already over a million documents being prepared to be released, documents that affect every country in the world. Every country in this world.\\"      Assange promised that in 2013 in his native Australia, \\"an unelected senator will be replaced by one that is elected.\\" But he didn’t mention his own plans to run for Senate there. He also took a jab at the press, declaring: \\"And for other journalists and publications – your work speaks for itself, and so do your war crimes.\\" And he pledged to make himself available for negotiations about his own fate, saying he would \\"not be cowed\\" but that \\"the door is open – and the door has always been open – for anyone who wishes to speak to me.\\"      The full transcript is available at WikiLeaks, if you don’t have twelve minutes to watch the video. Or if you want to skip to Assange’s outline of his plans for next year (the document dump is the only specific thing there), that starts at 8:55.      As The New York Times points out, Assange was speaking in a \\"brief pause before fact is replaced by fiction in the public consciousness,\\" as two films are currently being made about him.

Question: Question: Jane bought a small dog half way through her trip while driving back home to Toronto from Mexico.   Where might she have bought the dog? Options: - canada - illinois - basket - ball stopped - person's house  The answer is \\"illinois\\" because Answer:","output":"The locations provided as options are Canada, Illinois, and a person's house. \\"Basket\\" and \\"ball stopped\\" are not valid locations, so we can eliminate those. Since Jane was driving from Mexico to Toronto (which is in Canada), assuming she took a typical route, she was likely to pass through several US states before reaching Canada again. Illinois, being a state in the USA, could be on her route back home depending on her exact path. Therefore, given the details in the question and the available options, Jane might have bought the dog in Illinois.  Also, stating that she bought the dog 'half way through her trip' implies she bought the dog long before reaching Canada, so a location outside Canada is more plausible. She could also have bought the dog at a person's house, but without additional context, it's reasonable to choose a geographic location rather than a type of building. Thus, the context best supports \\"Illinois\\" as the likely answer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Separate data from the ONS showed that the UK's trade deficit widened in May. Sterling fell 0.7% against the dollar as analysts suggested an early interest rate rise was now less likely. Recent weeks have seen speculation that the Bank of England could raise rates later this year. This followed a surprisingly close vote on interest rate levels at the Bank's last meeting, when three members of the Monetary Policy Committee backed a rate rise. In addition, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said last week it needed \\"look seriously\\" at the possibility of raising interest rates to counter the recent pick-up in inflation. However, reacting to the latest economic figures, Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank, said: \\"It's all building up a pattern here that says the economy is clearly losing momentum. \\"It's not pointing to a particularly dynamic second quarter. Under those circumstances, the timing of the hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee pushing for a rate hike doesn't look great.\\" The ONS figures showed that manufacturing output fell by 0.2% compared with April, whereas analysts had expected it to rise. The sector was hit by a 4.4% drop in car production - the biggest fall since February last year. The wider measure of industrial output fell 0.1% following a 0.2% rise in April. Construction output was also worse than expected. It fell by 1.2% in May from April, and was also down 1.2% in the three months to May - the sharpest such drop since October 2015. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \\"The construction sector now is feeling acutely the adverse impact of Brexit uncertainty on the willingness of households and firms to make long-term financial commitments. \\"It's extremely unlikely that overall GDP growth accelerated in Q2 to the extent required to convince the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that higher interest rates are needed immediately.\\" The trade figures showed that the UK's total trade deficit in goods and services widened by £1bn to £3.1bn between April and May 2017. In the three months to the end of May, the deficit widened to £8.9bn from £6.9bn in the previous quarter, which ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said was mainly due to \\"high imports especially from outside the European Union\\". The UK's economy grew by 0.2% in the first three months of 2017, a sharp slowdown from the rate of 0.7% seen in the previous quarter. The economy has been affected by a slowdown in the UK's service sector, with indications that households are seeing their incomes squeezed by accelerating inflation.

It also says that the UK's trade deficit, which is when a country buys more things from other countries than it sells to them, got bigger in May. This made the value of the British currency, called sterling, go down a bit. Some people thought the Bank of England might raise interest rates, which can affect how much things cost and how much money people have. But now, they think that might not happen as soon as they thought because of the information from the ONS."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rajinikanth was born on 12 December 1950, in a Maratha family in Bangalore, Mysore State (present day Karnataka). His mother was a housewife, and his father Ramoji Rao Gaekwad, a police constable, He was named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad after Chhatrapati Shivaji, a Maratha warrior King, and was brought up speaking Marathi at home and Kannada outside. Rajinikanth's ancestors hailed from Mavadi Kadepathar, Maharashtra and Nachikuppam, Tamil Nadu. He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers (Satyanarayana Rao and Nageshwara Rao) and a sister (Aswath Balubhai). In January 2011, Rajinikanth was slated to appear in Rana, a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K. S. Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time. During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion. He was treated at St. Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged. Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit. Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth's health deteriorating. Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment. It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush.  On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth released a photo of her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs signal, responding to fans' negative reaction to news reports. The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported that the cause of the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011.  Despite several failed attempts to restart Rana upon his return, Rajinikanth reprised his Enthiran character, Chitti, in the Bollywood science-fiction film Ra.One (2011) in a guest appearance alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. In November 2011, it was decided that Rana would be shelved in favour of a new project with Rajinikanth, titled Kochadaiiyaan. The motion capture film, which is the first of its kind in India, was released in 2014 to positive reviews. Kochadaiiyaan, and the 3D release of Sivaji in 2012, made Rajinikanth the first Indian actor to have appeared in four different forms of world cinema: black-and-white, colour, 3D and motion capture. Following the completion of Kochadaiiyaan, Rajinikanth began work in Ravikumar's next directorial venture, titled Lingaa alongside Anushka Shetty and Sonakshi Sinha. The film was released on 12 December 2014, coinciding with his birthday, and received mixed reviews from critics. Rajinikanth's next film was director Pa. Ranjith's crime drama Kabali, produced by S. Thanu. The film was released in July 2016. Rajinikanth is filming for 2.0, a spiritual successor to Enthiran, that is scheduled for release in 2017. In August 2016, it was announced that he would work with Ranjith again for a new film produced by Dhanush.

Pick from: - Yes; - It's impossible to say; - No;","output":"Yes, based on the provided text, it can be concluded that the sentence \\"All We Ever Knew is folk\\" is true. The text specifies that \\"All We Ever Knew\\" is a song that was written and recorded by The Head and the Heart, an American folk band. Therefore, it would be reasonable to classify the song within the genre of the band that produced it, which in this case is folk. Moreover, there aren't any indications in the text that this song belongs to a genre different from the band's usual one. However, it is essential to note that this assessment is primarily based on the band's general genre of music, and it doesn't highlight whether the individual song \\"All We Ever Knew\\" may experiment with or incorporate elements of other music genres. A more decisive categorization could be accomplished by analyzing the song's musical attributes such as instrument use, vocal style, melody and rhythm structure, and lyric content. In the case of folk music, expectations would include a predominance of acoustic instruments, emotionally honest and primarily narrative lyrics, and probably a relatively structured yet simple melody and rhythm. If these characteristics are all present in \\"All We Ever Knew,\\" it strengthens the classification of the song as folk. Yet, the information provided in the text doesn't offer details to this extent, causing a slight potential for inaccuracy in the categorization.

Write a text based on this summary: crude oil prices continue to slip Text:","output":"Title: Crude Oil Prices Maintain Their Downward Trajectory The global crude oil market has witnessed a persistent decline in prices, as various factors continue to contribute to the downward trend. Despite attempts to stabilize the situation, crude oil prices seem unable to break free from their current decline. Behind this ongoing decrease in prices lies a complex interplay of factors, with a significant role being played by excess supply and low demand. Due to the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic activity worldwide has taken a hit, resulting in reduced demand for oil. Furthermore, the push for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources has led to a gradual shift away from fossil fuels like crude oil. Adding to the impact of reduced demand, the production levels of crude oil have remained consistently high. This oversupply has resulted in a congested market, putting downward pressure on prices. Additionally, the strife between key oil-producing nations, chiefly among OPEC+ members, often leads to disagreements on production quotas, further exacerbating the issue. Ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties also play a part in influencing the crude oil market. The fluctuating value of the US dollar adds another layer to this precarious situation, as oil prices tend to follow an inverse relationship with the strength of the US currency. In conclusion, the continuous slip in crude oil prices can be attributed to a combination of factors, including reduced global demand, excess production, geopolitical tensions, and the shift towards more sustainable energy sources. As these factors persist, the crude oil market is likely to face an uphill battle in the foreseeable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They drove all the way to the Patriots 5-yard line, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by kicker Matt Bryant. The Patriots responded later in the first quarter with a marathon drive of their own taking over 6 minutes off the clock, 12 plays and 76 yards later, third-string running back Brandon Bolden ran for a 3-yard touchdown, but the Falcons challenged and he didn't break the plane of the end zone, moving the ball back to the 1. Two plays later, Brady hit back-up tight end Matthew Mulligan for a 7-3 lead. On the following drive the Falcons put together another long, strong drive to the Patriots 15-yard line. On 3rd-and-10, Ryan found Jacquizz Rodgers on a screen pass for 8 yards, the Falcons kept the offense on the field, though, but on 4th-and-2 Ryan couldn't complete his pass intended for Roddy White and they turned it over on downs. The Patriots took over and marched to the Falcons 31, aided by a 49-yard completion from Brady to Thompkins, before Gostkowski booted a 48-yard field goal, extending the lead to 10-3. Right before half-time, Ryan and the Falcons stormed 80 yards in 8 plays eventually, scoring on Ryan's 21-yard touchdown pass to Tony Gonz&#225;lez with 0:46 left in the half which tied the game at 10.

The Falcons responded on their next possession driving all the way to the Patriot 18, but on 3rd-and-5, Michael Buchanan sacked Ryan, and Bryant kicked a 45-yard field goal, trimming the score back to 7 at 20-13.

The Patriots responded by racing 80 yards in only 5 plays, aided by a 44-yard screen pass to Edelman, scoring on an incredible 18-yard touchdown catch by Thompkins for the largest lead of the night at 27-13.

After an 8-yard run by Blount on 1st-down, Brady only gained a yards, and on 3rd-and-1 Blount seemingly stretched for a 1st down, but was ruled short, though replays showed he got the first down. After a timeout, the Patriots went for it on 4th-and-1, but Brady fumbled the snap for a turnover on downs. Starting from their own 38, Ryan connected with Julio Jones for a 49-yard bomb to the Patriots 13.

The reason is that we're all afraid of making fools of ourselves. The more important the speech is the more frightened we become.     But stop biting  your finger-nails. Public speaking is easy. It's just plain talking, and you talk all the time. Public speaking is not a \\"gift\\" like musical talent or being able to draw. Anybody who can talk can speak in public. Here are some tips:     Keep it simple. Your audience is going to learn one or two from your main ideas by heart.  If you can't express, then your speech is not focused well enough. And if you don't have a clear idea of what you want to say, then your audience will have no interest in your speech.      Get organized. No matter how long or short your speech is, you'd better get your materials in order: how you're going to start, what major points you want to make and how you're going to close. You may often write the last sentence first. When you know what your aim is, you can choose any ways to get there. A strong close is powerful. The last thing you say is what your audience will most likely remember.      Keep it short. The standard length of a vaudeville act was 12 minutes. If all those troupers want to sing and dance, they may make the audience bored. So make your speech short. Why does the author say \\"Public speaking is easy.\\" ?

It is Emerson College’s gleaming new 107,400-square-foot campus building on the famed Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, right in the heart of Hollywood and its movie studios. With construction of the flashy 85 million facility completed last year, the Boston school officially has opened its “Emerson College Los Angeles” campus building to rave reviews. Its striking look can best be described as cubes of aluminum and glass, shaped into a hollowed-out square, all 10 stories high. Many colleges and universities have established small satellite campuses elsewhere, usually overseas and often in Europe. In recent years, Boston’s Northeastern University has taken that concept a step further by opening satellite campuses in rented facilities in Charlotte in 2011 and in Seattle last year. Now Emerson College has upped the ante by building, not renting, its own satellite campus. Los Angeles Times architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne called it “impressive, monumental and supremely self-conscious all at once.” Emerson, which has run undergrad studies and internship programs in California for 27 years, previously leased classrooms and administrative space in nearby Burbank. Every semester, about 100 students headed west from Boston for undergrad classes there. But Emerson president M. Lee Pelton said the school’s more than 4,000 alumni living around Los Angeles have long urged the college to establish a permanent satellite home in the area. The new L.A. campus building — which includes screening rooms, studios, audio and video labs, dorms, and classrooms — was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Thom Mayne. Emerson isn’t bashful about taking bows for the end results. “What Emerson has done is build an already iconic, stunning building in the heart of Los Angeles,” said Pelton. “What Emerson has done in Los Angeles is distinctive.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Emerson College, a school from Boston, built a big, new, and shiny building in Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard.

Andy Warhol (; born Andrew Warhola; August 6, 1928 - February 22, 1987) was an American artist, director and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture, and advertising that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings Campbell's Soup Cans (1962) and Marilyn Diptych (1962), the experimental film Chelsea Girls (1966), and the multimedia events known as the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966-67). Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a commercial illustrator. Warhol died in Manhattan at 6:32 a.m. on February 22, 1987 at age 58. According to news reports, he had been making a good recovery from gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative irregular heartbeat. Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication. The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.  Shortly before Warhol's death, doctors expected Warhol to survive the surgery, though a revaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that Warhol's surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought. It was widely reported at the time that Warhol died of a \\"routine\\" surgery, though when considering factors such as his age, a family history of gallbladder problems, his previous gunshot wounds, and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.  Warhol's brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-coffin wake was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church on Pittsburgh's North Side. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. Yoko Ono and John Richardson were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and asparagus ferns. After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park, a south suburb of Pittsburgh.  At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, Paige Powell dropped a copy of Interview magazine, an Interview T-shirt, and a bottle of the Estee Lauder perfume \\"Beautiful\\" into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York.

In contrast, comments that do not meet these criteria are deemed non-obscene. Task guidelines: 1. Read the given comment. 2. Identify any offensive language, sexually explicit content, or taboo words. 3. If the comment contains any of the criteria mentioned in step 2, classify it as obscene. Otherwise, classify it as non-obscene.

Given the presence of a potentially offensive word, the classification of this comment becomes a matter of judgment. For some, it may be classified as non-obscene because it doesn't cross the threshold of being highly offensive or containing sexually explicit content. However, for others with a stricter definition of obscenity, it may be considered obscene due to the presence of potentially offensive language. Considering the context of the comment and that it doesn't contain any sexually explicit content or highly offensive language, I would classify it as non-obscene.

According to this data, Strada isn't just another casual dining spot, but rather a place that consistently provides exceptional food and service, leading it to secure the highest customer satisfaction rating possible. This rating indicates that customers are frequently pleased with their experiences at Strada, and they're always eager to acknowledge the exceptional value and quality they receive. The 'eatType' restaurant classification indicates that Strada likely offers a sit-down dining experience, as opposed to fast food or take-away options. This type of setting tends to contribute positively to customer experience as it often involves attentive service from the waiting staff, ambient atmosphere and carefully prepared dishes. The perfect rating suggests that Strada is very likely meeting or even exceeding these expectations in the eyes of its customers. Moreover, the name 'Strada' which implies 'street' in Italian might so hint that the restaurant could be offering Italian cuisine or at least Italian-inspired dishes, which again is a popular cuisine choice among restaurant-goers, reinforcing why it has a great rating. Lastly, receiving a 5 out of 5 rating conveys a level of confidence to potential new patrons considering dining at Strada. It communicates clear approval from previous customers, which can be a crucial deciding factor for many people when choosing a dining establishment. In a sea of 'eatType' restaurants, having such a stellar rating could certainly make Strada stand out among its competitors and continually attract new and recurring patrons.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again? is inside the article: Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157.

Bush said Republicans also need to articulate an alternative to the reform law.      \\"I think the best way to repeal ObamaCare is to have an alternative; we never hear the alternative,\\" Bush said. \\"We could do this in a much lower cost with improved quality based on our principles, free market principles.\\"      Read more about: Jeb Bush, Obamacare ||||| Sen.

Because the program she implanted, Obamacare, is a disaster. It’s not working, it’s hurting people all across the country,\\" Cruz said in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN's \\"State of the Union.\\"      The freshman Republican senator from Texas went even further, attacking \\"grey beards\\" in his own party when asked whether Sebelius remaining in the administration would benefit GOP attack strategies.      \\"You know it’s interesting...some Republican grey beards in Washington who make the point, ‘Let’s just let this collapse, and then Republicans will benefit.’ Now look, I profoundly disagree with their message. I want to step on their message,\\" Cruz said.      \\"Number one, I consider that the ‘bad Samaritan theory,’ basically inflict a bunch of harm on the American people and hope we benefit politically from it. What a terrible, cynical approach,\\" he added. \\"I’m not interested in seeing the American people suffer just because my party might benefit politically if they blame the Democrats for the foolish policies that have been imposed.\\"      Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), also appearing on \\"State of the Union,\\" agreed that Obamacare is a disaster, but did not explicitly call for Sebelius to resign.      \\"Let’s have congressional hearings, let’s find out who’s responsible for this fiasco and then take the appropriate action,\\" McCain said.      \\"There’s going to be a whole lot more problems associated with this before it’s done. That’s why we Republicans have to keep up the fight, but we have to rifle shot it, rather than go at it with a meat ax, which cannot succeed,\\" he said.      \\"Look, it’s been a fiasco,\\" McCain went on. \\"Send Air Force One out to Silicon Valley, load it up with some smart people, bring them back to Washington and fix this problem.

Spanish:","output":"La propiedad está situada en el pueblo de Livadia.  In this sentence, we are describing the location of a property, particularly mentioning that it can be found in the village called Livadia. Below is a detailed analysis of the translation: 1. \\"The property\\" translates to \\"La propiedad\\" – \\"The\\" is an article that translates to \\"La\\" because \\"propiedad\\" (property) is a feminine noun in Spanish. Therefore, we use the feminine article \\"La\\" to agree with the noun.  2. \\"is situated\\" translates to \\"está situada\\" – \\"is situated\\" is describing the state or location of the property, for which we use the verb \\"estar\\" in Spanish. The verb \\"estar\\" needs to be conjugated according to the subject, in this case, \\"La propiedad,\\" which is in the third person singular. As a result, the conjugation is \\"está.\\" Since \\"propiedad\\" is a feminine noun, we also need to use the feminine version of the adjective \\"situada\\" to agree with \\"La propiedad.\\"  3. \\"in\\" translates to \\"en\\" – \\"in\\" is a preposition used to indicate location in English, and it can be directly translated to \\"en\\" in Spanish, which serves the same purpose.  4. \\"the village\\" translates to \\"el pueblo\\" – \\"The\\" is an article that translates to \\"el\\" because \\"pueblo\\" (village) is a masculine noun in Spanish. As a result, we use the masculine article \\"el\\" to agree with the noun. \\"Village\\" translates to \\"pueblo,\\" which is the Spanish equivalent to indicate a smaller, rural human settlement. 5. \\"of Livadia\\" translates to \\"de Livadia\\" – \\"of\\" is a preposition that denotes possession or association in English and can be translated to \\"de\\" in Spanish. In this context, the village's name is \\"Livadia.\\" We wouldn't change the name in the translation. Thus, we keep it as \\"Livadia.\\" With these elements altogether, we form the translated sentence: \\"La propiedad está situada en el pueblo de Livadia.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, the movement drew its energy and momentum from the shared passion and commitment of everyday people who longed for change and fought for their rights and aspirations. This grassroots nature of the campaign made it a powerful force that resonated with the larger population, contributing to its success and significance.

Solution:","output":"In order to translate the given Spanish sentence \\"Encontraron algo llamado Facebook\\" into Hebrew, I will follow these steps: 1. Analyze the sentence and identify the subject, verb, and objects. 2. Determine the grammatical structure and tense of the sentence in Spanish. 3. Recreate the sentence structure in Hebrew while maintaining the tense and meaning of the original sentence. 4. Translate each word or expression individually from Spanish to Hebrew. 5. Reorder the words, if necessary, following the rules for Hebrew word order. Step 1: In the sentence \\"Encontraron algo llamado Facebook\\", the subject is not explicitly mentioned, and it can be inferred to be \\"they\\" from the verb conjugation. The verb is \\"encontraron\\" (found), the direct object is \\"algo\\" (something), and \\"llamado Facebook\\" (called Facebook) is an adjective phrase describing the direct object. Step 2: The verb tense is simple past, which will need to be maintained in the Hebrew translation. Step 3: In Hebrew, the verb typically comes first in a sentence, followed by the subject and direct object. Because the subject is not explicitly stated, the structure will be verb-direct object-adjective phrase. Step 4: Translate the individual words and expressions into Hebrew: - Encontraron: מצאו (matza'u) - algo: משהו (mashehu) - llamado: שנקרא (shenikra) - Facebook: פייסבוק (Facebook) Step 5: Arrange the words to create the Hebrew sentence: מצאו משהו שנקרא פייסבוק (matza'u mashehu shenikra Facebook) Solution: The Hebrew translation of the Spanish sentence \\"Encontraron algo llamado Facebook\\" is: מצאו משהו שנקרא פייסבוק (matza'u mashehu shenikra Facebook)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Another busy day for visiting royals Charles and Camilla There’s no rest for the royal. Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, on Thursday continued their barnstorming Washington tour, meeting adult immigrant students, retired vets, and even — according to their schedule — President Obama. The couple started out Day Two of the D.C. leg of their historic U.S. visit strolling past the Lincoln Cottage on the grounds of the Armed Forces Retirement Home, where the 16th president frequently sought refuge from the White House’s heat — both literal and political. In the retirement home itself, they greeted retirees, admired amateur artwork and interrupted workouts in the gym. After that, it was divide and conquer (figuratively, of course — we settled that old business a long time ago), with Prince Charles splitting off to visit the Carlos Rosario Charter School for adult immigrant students. Much handshaking ensued. [RELATED: Royal Watch! Updates from Charles and Camilla’s jam-packed day in D.C.] According to a report about the visit, the prince even had one of those moments akin to when former President George H.W. Bush marveled at electronic checkouts at grocery stores, long after most commoners had gotten used to them. “In a classroom for intermediate life skills like opening a checking account, the prince commented that it sounded ‘complicated,’ eliciting laughs from the students,” the report said. At around 2 p.m., the prince and the duchess met with President Obama and Vice President Biden in the Oval. When a pool reported asked the president if he’d spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama answered cheekily, “Really Jeff?!?” and apparently Charles found this hilarious. He left out a laugh and blushed profusely, according to the pool report. Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, sat down with President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden as part of their four-dayl tour to boost British-American partnership. (Reuters) The president and prince then chatted like tweens about who was more popular. Seriously. “I think it’s fair to say that the American people are quite fond of the royal family,” said Obama. “They like them much better than they like their own politicians.” Ever the polite and proper guest, Charles demurred, “I don’t believe that.” After the White House meeting, there’s an event with the prince for the Marshall Scholars program and the duchess plans to attend a reception at the National Museum for Women in the Arts. Then Charles is set to give a speech at the International Conservation Caucus Foundation Awards. And all that running around is after a full evening of socializing. On Wednesday night, the couple’s first stop was a reception at the British embassy. Among the powerhouses who made the oh-so-exclusive invite list: Chief Justice John Roberts, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Teri Sewell (D-Ala.). Then it was on to a dinner at the home of Barbara Albritton, the chair of The Prince of Wales’s U.S. Foundation.

Options: - miscarriage of justice - guilt - testify - lies - truth  Explain why a human would choose \\"guilt\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"A human would choose \\"guilt\\" to answer the question above because perjury is the act of knowingly making false statements while under oath, typically during a legal proceeding or in a court of law. When someone commits perjury, they are deliberately misleading the court and potentially jeopardizing the outcome of the case, which can lead to miscarriage of justice. Choosing \\"guilt\\" as the answer reflects the fact that a person committing perjury is likely to feel guilt or experience a sense of guilt for their dishonest actions – even if they do not openly acknowledge it. Guilt is an emotional response to actions that are morally or ethically wrong, and knowingly making false statements under oath is considered to be a serious offense against the justice system and society as a whole. Additionally, in many jurisdictions, perjury is a felony, which means it comes with legal consequences, furthering the guilt an individual could experience. Breaking down the other options: 1. Miscarriage of justice: While perjury can contribute to a miscarriage of justice, this option does not encompass the emotions or experiences of the individual committing the act. 2. Testify: Testifying is the act of giving a statement or evidence, which may or may not include perjury. It does not specifically address the emotions or experiences of someone who commits perjury. 3. Lies: While lies can be a part of perjury, choosing \\"lies\\" as the answer does not encompass the personal experience or emotions an individual committing perjury is likely to have. 4. Truth: Truth is the opposite of what someone committing perjury is doing, and it does not pertain to the emotions or experiences the individual might be feeling. Therefore, \\"guilt\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question because it addresses the emotions that someone who is committing perjury is most likely to experience as a result of their dishonest actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose If the alveoli activity increases happens, how will it affect more oxygen reaches the tissue.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have a direct effect on the process. By affecting the activity of alveoli in the lungs, this change would likely result in an increase in the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed into the blood. This is because the alveoli are where the exchange of gases happens within the lungs, they are responsible for absorbing oxygen from the air we breathe into the bloodstream, and removing carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the air we breathe out. If the activity of the alveoli increases, it would mean that they are functioning with greater efficiency or in greater amount, allowing more oxygen to be absorbed into the bloodstream in each breath. Consequently, the red blood cells would have more oxygen to pick up and deliver throughout the body. This would result in more oxygen being delivered to the various tissues in the body. Thus, we could expect a direct impact resulting from the hypothetical increase in alveoli activity: more oxygen would reach the tissue. Therefore, an increase in the activity of the alveoli can be beneficial in terms of body's oxygen supply. However, it's important to note that the body needs to maintain a balanced level of oxygen, as too much oxygen could also lead to damage known as oxygen toxicity. So, in conclusion, yes, if the activity of the alveoli were to increase, it would likely directly result in more oxygen reaching the tissues in the body, assuming that the rest of the oxygen transport and delivery system in the body is functioning efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

Keeping the tank temperature between 76 to 80 °F (24 to 27 °C) ensures that your fish remain comfortable and healthy. Consistently monitoring and maintaining the temperature is essential for the well-being of your aquatic pets. Using a quality aquarium heater and thermometer is recommended to maintain the desired temperature within the tank. 2. Installing a Filter: Installing a suitable filter in your fish tank is crucial for keeping the water clean and providing the necessary water flow. A filter helps remove both mechanical debris and harmful chemicals from the water, thus maintaining a healthy environment for the fish. Filters come in a variety of types and sizes, so be sure to select the one that suits your tank size and fish species. 3. Regular Tank Cleaning: Weekly cleaning of your fish tank is essential in prevention of illness as dirty tanks can harbor bacteria, parasites, and other toxins that can be harmful to your fish. Part of your weekly cleaning routine should include replacing 20-25% of the water, removing uneaten food and waste, and scrubbing algae from the surfaces. Make sure to use dechlorinated water for your water changes and avoid using harsh chemicals that might damage your aquarium's biological filter. 4. Adequate Lighting: Providing adequate lighting for your fish is crucial for their well-being and growth. Lighting is essential to plankton or algae growth, which in turn provides essential nutrients to your fish. Additionally, proper lighting can aid in the growth of spines in fish. Turn on the tank light for 8 to 12 hours a day to ensure that your fish stay healthy and grow properly. Equipping the tank with a timer will help you provide consistent lighting and maintain a natural day-night cycle for your aquatic pets. Conclusion: To maintain a healthy and thriving fish tank environment, it is essential to keep the tank temperature between 76 to 80 °F (24 to 27 °C), install a filter, clean the tank weekly, and provide adequate lighting. By fulfilling these requirements, not only will your fish live healthier lives, but you will also enjoy the beauty and ambiance that a well-maintained fish tank brings to your home or office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What kind of passive construction does Czech have?  A: Although Czech has a periphrastic passive construction (like English), colloquial word-order changes frequently produce the passive voice.  Does the answer correctly answer the question Options:  (A). yes.  (B). no.","output":"A: The Czech language, a West Slavic language, has several passive constructions that are essential to comprehend when studying or speaking the language. Primarily, there are three types of passive constructions found in Czech: the periphrastic passive, the reflexive passive, and the adjectival passive. 1. Periphrastic Passive: This is the most common and widely used form of passive construction in the Czech language, which is generally formed by using auxiliary verbs and past participles just like in English. The verb \\"být\\" (to be) is commonly used as an auxiliary verb with the past participle agreeing in gender and number with the subject. For instance, \\"Kniha byla napsána.\\" (The book was written.) 2. Reflexive Passive: This type of passive construction involves the use of the reflexive pronoun \\"se\\" along with the active verb form. The reflexive passive is more frequent in colloquial Czech and is usually used when the agent (the person or thing performing the action) is not important or unknown. For example, \\"Staví se nový dům.\\" (A new house is being built.) 3. Adjectival Passive: Adjectival passive constructs in Czech involve the use of passive participles as adjectives. These are formed by adding specific gender and number agreement suffixes to the verb stem. Adjectival passives often occur in subordinate clauses or when describing states. For instance, \\"Otevřené dveře vedly do zahrady.\\" (The opened door led to the garden.) In conclusion, passive constructions in the Czech language encompass a variety of forms, including the periphrastic passive, reflexive passive, and adjectival passive. Each form has specific usage patterns and characteristics depending on the context and importance of the agent in a sentence."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Many of these ailments may not present with obvious signs, making it challenging for cat owners to determine the cause behind their pet's discomfort. An attentive owner can, however, save their cat from much pain and inconvenience if they are able to identify the underlying issue. In this article, we will discuss some common health problems that cat owners should be aware of, including fighting injuries, ear lumps (such as haematoma), cysts, food allergies, and flea bites. Step 1: Determine whether the cat has been fighting Cats are territorial animals and may resort to fighting with other cats to assert dominance or protect their territory. Fighting can lead to various injuries, including puncture wounds, scratches, and even infections. To know if your cat has been in a fight, check for the following signs:  - Fresh or scabbed scratches and puncture wounds - Swelling, redness, or discharge around the wounds - Behavioural changes such as increased aggressiveness, hiding, or lethargy If you suspect that your cat has been injured in a fight, it's essential to consult a veterinarian for appropriate treatment. Step 2: Assess whether an ear lump is a haematoma A haematoma is a localized collection of blood outside blood vessels, usually caused by an injury. Ear lumps can indicate a haematoma, which can be caused by a cat excessively scratching or shaking its head due to an irritated, itchy, or painful ear. To assess if your cat has an ear haematoma, look for these signs: - Swelling or lump in the ear flap - Discomfort or pain when the ear is touched - Excessive head shaking or scratching at the affected ear If you suspect a haematoma, it's crucial to contact a veterinarian for the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Step 3: Have cysts removed Cysts are abnormal sacs filled with fluid, gas, or semisolid material that can form on or under the skin. They can occur in cats due to various reasons, such as infection, inflammation, or injury. It's essential to have cysts evaluated and removed by a veterinarian to prevent complications and ensure your cat's comfort. Step 4: Consider a potential food allergy Food allergies in cats can result in various symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, itching, and allergic reactions. If you notice any signs of food allergies in your cat, it's important to consult a veterinarian who can help identify the causative allergen and recommend a suitable diet to avoid it. Step 5: Rule out flea bites Cats can be extremely sensitive to flea bites, resulting in skin irritation, itching, and anemia. To determine if your cat is suffering from flea bites, thoroughly inspect its coat and skin for fleas or flea droppings. Flea preventive measures like regular application of flea control products can help minimize the risk of flea infestations. Conclusion: Keeping an eye on your cat's overall well-being, behaviour, and appearance can help you promptly identify and address potential health concerns. If you suspect any of the above ailments or notice any unusual changes in your cat's behaviour or appearance, consult your veterinarian for a thorough evaluation and appropriate treatment. Ensuring your cat has regular check-ups will help maintain its optimal health and avoid future complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The lady of the house, Violet Devereaux (Gena Rowlands), looks after her husband Benjamin Devereaux (John Hurt), who has had a stroke. With some prompting from the family's estate lawyer, Luke Marshall (Peter Sarsgaard), Caroline accepts the position. Caroline, using a skeleton key that Violet gave her, makes her way to the attic (where Ben had his stroke) and finds a secret room. She discovers dolls, a book of spells, potion jars, and various other magical paraphernalia. Violet reveals to Caroline that the room belonged to two house servants who were employed there 90 years prior. The couple, Mama Cecile (Jeryl Prescott) and Papa Justify (Ron McCall) were renowned practitioners of Hoodoo and were lynched for practicing spells with children. Violet also tells Caroline that they do not keep mirrors in the house because they see the reflection of the servants in them. Caroline then believes that since Ben believes Hoodoo caused his stroke, she can use Hoodoo, or more specifically Ben's belief in it to reverse the effects. Taking advice from her friend Jill (Joy Bryant), she goes to a local laundromat, known to have a hidden Hoodoo shop, to acquire a defense for Ben. A practitioner teaches her a ritual with items to use to cleanse Ben's illness; when Caroline practices the ritual, Ben regains some of his ability to speak, and begs Caroline to get him away from Violet. Caroline tells Luke about her suspicions towards Violet, but he rebuffs her idea. They travel to a gas station that Caroline previously noted was lined with brick dust, which she was told is a defense against Hoodoo. A blind woman tells her of the Conjure of Sacrifice, a spell of immortality, in which the caster sacrifices someone and gains the remaining years of their life. Caroline increasingly believes that Ben is in danger, but Luke belittles her fear. Caroline uses brick dust to...

A new study shows those who follow the increasingly well-regarded Mediterranean diet have less brain atrophy than those who don't. Researchers scanned the brains of 674 Manhattan residents over 80 who showed no signs of dementia, and analyzed their diets based on a questionnaire, reports the Guardian. The patients who kept to a Mediterranean diet had a brain volume that was 13.11 milliliters larger than others, their gray matter volume was 5 milliliters larger, and their white brain matter was 6.41 milliliters larger. Since people's brains shrink with age, researchers say the difference in brain volume is equal to about five years of aging. This doesn't mean the Mediterranean diet slows brain aging, but it does show an association. And with greater brain volume comes more brain cells. \\"The more brain cells you have available, the more likely you are to be protected against illnesses of the brain related to aging, like Alzheimer's,\\" a doctor tells CBS News, adding omega-3 fatty acids found in fish may benefit nerve cells, while B vitamins in fruits and veggies may prevent the buildup of plaque in the brain. \\"These results are exciting, as they raise the possibility that people may potentially prevent brain shrinking and the effects of aging on the brain simply by following a healthy diet,\\" lead author Yian Gu says. One aspect of the diet stood out, though. \\"Eating at least three to five ounces of fish weekly or eating no more than 3.5 ounces of meat daily may provide considerable protection against loss of brain cells equal to about three to four years of aging,\\" Gu adds. (The diet might also add years to your life.) Expand this summary.","output":"To avoid things like brain shrinkage, memory problems, and other brain issues as you get older, it's a good idea to eat lots of fish, veggies, and nuts. There's something called the Mediterranean diet which is really good for you. A study looked at the brains of 674 older people and found that the ones who followed this diet had bigger brains.  As we get older, our brains usually get smaller. But in this study, the people who ate like this had brains the size of someone five years younger. This doesn't mean that eating this way will for sure make your brain stay young, but it's a good sign. Having a bigger brain means you have more brain cells, which can help you stay healthy as you get older. A fancy word for this is Alzheimer's, which is when older people start to forget things a lot. Eating fish, fruits, and veggies has good things in it like omega-3 and B vitamins. These are like superheroes for your brain, helping it stay strong and healthy.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. In 1998, Combs started a clothing line, Sean John. It was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000, and won in 2004. California billionaire Ronald Burkle invested 100 million into the company in 2003.  Also in 2003, the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the clothing in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws. Among the accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests. Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled. Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages. Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told The New York Times that \\"Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout, he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers.\\"  Combs responded with an extensive investigation, telling reporters \\"I'm as pro-worker as they get\\". On February 14, 2004, Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory, including adding air conditioning and water purification systems, firing the most abusive supervisors, and allowing the formation of a labor union. In late 2006, the department store Macy's removed Sean John jackets from their shelves when they discovered that the clothing was made using raccoon dog fur. Combs had not known the jackets were made with dog fur, but as soon as he was alerted, he had production stopped.  In November 2008, Combs added a men's perfume called \\"I Am King\\" to the Sean John brand. The fragrance, dedicated to Barack Obama, Muhammad Ali, and Martin Luther King, featured model Bar Refaeli in its advertisements. In early 2016, Sean John introduced the brand's GIRLS collection.

Simplify the equation: -46*y + 42*y + 12 = 0 Combine like terms (add the coefficients of the y terms): (-46 + 42)*y + 12 = 0 Simplifying, we get: -4*y + 12 = 0 2. Isolate y: Now, we need to isolate y. We can do this by first moving the constant term (the 12) to the other side of the equation. -4*y = -12 Next, we will divide both sides of the equation by -4 (the coefficient of y) to isolate y: y = -12 / -4 3.

There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work.

Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\"  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who are two people in the passage that question the safety of e-cigarettes?\\" is \\"They are Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California and Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA\\"? Choose from: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"[b]. yes; The correct answer is \\"yes\\" because Dr. Jonathan Samet and Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg both question the safety of e-cigarettes in the passage.

Voting will take five weeks, with results due on 16 May. More than 814 million people are eligible to vote in a poll dominated by corruption and high inflation. Mr Negi, who lives in the Himalayan village of Kalpa in Kinnaur district, will cast his vote on 7 May, the day voting will be held in all five seats of Himachal Pradesh. The Election Commission of India has held him up as an example to others, and Google India recently put out a video on Mr Negi - #PledgeToVote tells the \\"true story of a man who never missed an opportunity to vote\\". Election Commission of India Since the video went up on 24 March, it has been viewed by nearly 1.7 million people around the world. The short film begins with Mr Negi sipping tea at home, looking out at the spectacular snow covered peaks. Then, he puts on his coat and cap, picks up his walking stick and begins his journey to the polling centre. Walking upright and sure-footed on the snow-covered road which winds through apple orchards and pine woods, he arrives at the polling station to a grand welcome by fellow tribespeople before casting his vote. The film also describes Mr Negi as the country's first voter - it says that independent India's first polling station was set up at Kalpa months before elections were held in the rest of India in February 1952. \\"Before the roads got blocked in deep winter, we voted several months ahead of the rest of India on 25 October 1951,\\" Mr Negi says. \\"Since then I have voted in every general election and the state assembly elections.

It was snowing heavily as I walked to vote for the first time.\\" Mr Negi refuses to divulge which party has his support. \\"I will vote for a party which will sincerely attempt to change the country and provide a good government.\\" He is not particularly excited by the Nota (None of The Above) option the Election Commission has introduced for the first time in these elections. Nota gives the voter an option to reject all candidates. \\"I am not in favour of Nota.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"If less coal is delivered, it will directly impact a step of the process, specifically the first step, where coal is mined out of the ground. The entire process relies on a sufficient amount of coal to generate the necessary heat for the house. Therefore, a reduction in the coal supply will inevitably affect the subsequent steps of the process. When less coal is available, it will be harder to produce the same amount of energy required for heating the house. The coal is pulverized into a fine powder, mixed with hot air, and burned over a fire in the boiler. If less coal is present, the combustion of coal will be less efficient, resulting in decreased heat production. This directly impacts the steps involving the mixing of coal with hot air, the burning of coal, and the generation of heat. The subsequent steps of the process, such as heating highly purified water to produce steam and spinning the turbines to produce electricity, will also be indirectly impacted. Since less heat is generated due to the reduced amount of coal present, the water may not turn into steam as efficiently, leading to a less effective steam production. Consequently, the pressure exerted on the turbines will be lower, causing the turbines to spin at a slower rate and generate less electricity. In summary, the supposed perturbation in this scenario is directly impacting the steps of the coal combustion process and indirectly impacting the subsequent steps related to steam and electricity production. This perturbation would adversely affect the overall heat production for the house, making it challenging to maintain the desired temperature. To counteract this issue, alternative or supplemental heat sources may be required to provide the necessary warmth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The San Andreas is the state's longest fault and perhaps its most famous—well-known enough to be the standalone title of a recent disaster film. And, says the LA Times, citing an earthquake expert speaking at the National Earthquake Conference, it's also the one we need to be keeping our eyes on the most right now.      The issue is that the fault line has been too quiet for too long. Scientists have found that the \\"earthquakes should be relieving about 16 feet of accumulated plate movement every 100 years\\" on the San Andreas, but the fault hasn't let off any steam in way over a century.      The southern section of the fault hasn't had a big 'quake since 1857, which \\"ruptured an astonishing 185 miles between Monterey County and the San Gabriel Mountains,\\" near LA, in a 7.9 earthquake. Other nearby sections of the fault are also overdue. A segment by the Cajon Pass (where the 15 Freeway cuts between the San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains) \\"have not moved substantially\\" since an 1812 earthquake, and over by the Salton Sea, it's been seismically silent as far back as 1680.      That indicates it's long overdue for a rupture. Or, to put it more chillingly, \\"The springs on the San Andreas system have been wound very, very tight. And the southern San Andreas fault, in particular, looks like it’s locked, loaded and ready to go.\\"      The expert, Thomas Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, went on to say that, with this information, LA should focus on being prepared for a BIG one—a magnitude 8 or so. (For perspective, a 2008 US Geological Survey study warned that a 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas would send shaking far and wide from the Coachella Valley and Inland Empire to East LA and the San Gabriel Valley, and cause about 2,000 deaths. So, stronger than that.)      Jordan applauded the city's efforts to retrofit buildings vulnerable to collapse in a strong seismic event, saying, \\"It’s remarkable that this happened...We know politically how difficult it is to make these kinds of changes.\\" LA's also at work making its cell phone network more resilient to serious shaking so that communication post-'quake would still be possible.      With most Angelenos less than totally prepared for a significant earthquake, there's no time like the present to get started. ||||| The quake was so powerful that the soil liquefied, causing trees as far away as Stockton to sink. Trees were also uprooted west of Fort Tejon. The shaking lasted 1 to 3 minutes.      Even though the San Andreas fault does not go directly into Los Angeles — it is 30 miles away from downtown — the city is expected to be heavily shaken by a large earthquake on that fault. For instance, simulations of a possible magnitude 7.8 quake on the San Andreas fault that begins at the Salton Sea and spreads west toward the San Gabriel mountains show seismic shaking waves \\"bent into the Los Angeles area,\\" Jordan said. One video shows strong ground-shaking stretching from northern San Diego County to Barstow.      Using the world's largest supercomputer at the time, the Southern California Earthquake Center in 2010 unveiled a simulated magnitude 8 earthquake that begins in Monterey County, like in 1857, but travels even farther south, heading toward the Mexican border. The L.A. Basin and the San Fernando Valley would be hit hard because the shaking would be trapped by soft soils in the valley and basin.      \\"You can see that this area of influence by the shaking has now expanded out to huge proportions,\\" Jordan said. \\"You see that big directivity pulse out in front, as that energy is being shoved down that fault, that directivity pulse leads energy into seismic waves that excite the sedimentary basins, like the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin,\\" and through San Bernardino, Jordan said.      \\"You'll notice large shaking in the Los Angeles region persisting for long periods of time,\\" he said. ||||| Plate tectonics describes the motions of the 15 to 20 large rigid and brittle tectonic plates into which the Earth's outermost layer (called the \\"lithosphere\\") is broken. It does a good job at explaining the distribution of most of Earth's earthquakes, mountains and other geological features, and a particularly good job at explaining features on the ocean floor. However, it is challenged to explain the details of the older rocks on the continents, and the occurrence of deformation an earthquakes off of plate boundaries.      Beyond merely describing current plate motions, Plate Tectonics provides an overarching framework that connects many elements of Earth science. Plate tectonics is a relatively young scientific theory that needed the advancement of observational and computing technology in the 1950s and 1960s to become fully elaborated. Its explanatory gravitas and the weight of observational evidence overcame much initial skepticism over how mobile the Earth's surface really is, and Plate Tectonics quickly became universally accepted by scientists throughout the world.      This animation shows, in a very exaggerated way, the sorts of movements Plate Tectonics implies. Plate Tectonics is a theory of motions at the Earth's surface, but to drive those motions, it relies on a planet with a very active inner life! It is important to remember that the one-minute-long movie actually represents millions of real Earth-years!      This is a map of the main tectonic plates that comprise the Earth's surface:      In the Pacific Northwest movement of three tectonic plates drive our earthquake hazard. The Pacific Plate is moving to the northwest at a speed of between 7 and 11 centimeters (cm) or ~3-4 inches a year.      The North American plate is moving to the west-southwest at about 2.3 cm (~1 inch) per year driven by the spreading center that created the Atlantic Ocean, the Mid Atlantic Ridge. This may seem like small and slow motion but over geologic time scales these movements add up to hundreds and thousands of kilometers, and can reform parts of the surface of Earth.      The small Juan De Fuca Plate, moving east-northeast at 4 cm (~1.6 inches) per year, was once part of a much larger oceanic plate called the Farallon Plate. The Farallon plate used to include what is now the Cocos Plate off Mexico and Central America and the Juan de Fuca Plate in our region from N. Vancouver Island to Cape Mendicino California and a large tract of sea floor real estate in between. But the central part of the old Farallon plate vanished beneath North America. It was subducted beneath California leaving the San Andreas fault system behind as the contact between the North America and Pacific plates.      The Juan de Fuca Plate is still actively subducting beneath N. America. Its motion is not smooth, but rather sticky; strain builds up until the fault breaks and a few meters of Juan De Fuca slips under North America in a big earthquake. This action takes place along the interface between the plates from the Juan de Fuca Trench off shore down-dip until the fault is too weak to store up any elastic stress. The locked zone varies in width from a few tens of kilometers (km) along the Oregon coast to perhaps a hundred km or more off of Washington's Olympic Penninsula, and is about 1,000 km long. It takes a lot of slip (10s of meters) over a very large area to generate the M9 subduction zone earthquakes that rock our region ~ every 550 years on average.      These plate motions are the primary source of strain in the lithosphere that lead to earthquakes in our region. In California, much of the strain generated by the grinding of the Pacific Plate against North America is taken up in earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault and related structures. But, the shearing action dosn't end there.      The Sierra Nevada block is driven north-northwest into the Oregon Coastal Range. This block of crust is rotated west and pushed north into Washington state.      British Columbia however is part of rigid North America and moves with it. This results in the Puget Lowland being compressed and warped like an accordion with alternating uplifted and down warped terrain shortening the distance between Centralia, Washington, and the Canadia border. Dr. Ray Wells of the USGS developed a model to demonstrate this process and produced the cartoon animation located above the GPS Vector map.      Shoveling off all the sedimentary deposits from the basement rocks underlying the Puget Lowland would certainly be one way to reveal this pattern. But that would involve way too much digging! Fortunately geophysics allows us an much easier way to uncover the basement--measure the gravity.      This map of gravity residuals measured over the puget lowland reveals a pattern of deep, fault bounded basins (cool colors) and uplifts (warm colors). Notice the Seattle Fault Zone bounding the Seattle Basin to the south. The South Whidbey Island Fault and Darrington Devil's Mountain Fault bound the Everett Basin. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

In a conference this week, the state was warned to prepare for a potential earthquake as strong as magnitude 8.0.      \\"The springs on the San Andreas system have been wound very, very tight. And the southern San Andreas fault, in particular, looks like it’s locked, loaded and ready to go,\\" said Thomas Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Centre.      Jordan gave his warning in the keynote talk of the annual National Earthquake Conference in Long Beach, the Los Angeles Times reports.      Here's why he's so worried: research has shown that the Pacific plate is moving northwest relative to the North American plate at a rate of around 5 metres (16 feet) every 100 years - and that's building up a whole lot of tension along the San Andreas fault line that needs to be relieved regularly.      But the last time southern California experienced a major shake-up was in 1857, when a magnitude 7.9 quake rupture almost 300 km (185 miles) between Monterey County and the San Gabriel Mountains.      Further south, areas of the fault line have been quiet even longer, with San Bernardino county not moving substantially since 1812, and the region near the Salton Sea remaining still since the late 1600s.      All of this means that there's a lot of tension underneath California right now. Last year, Jordan's team found there's a 7 percent chance the state will experience a magnitude 8.0 quake in the next three decades.      And that's a big problem. Back in 2008, a US Geological Survey report found that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault could cause more than 1,800 deaths, 50,000 injuries, US200 billion in damage, and long-lasting infrastructure disruptions - such as six months of compromised sewer systems and ongoing wildfires.      Even though Los Angeles isn't on the San Andreas fault line, simulations by the Southern California Earthquake Centre show that the shaking would quickly spread there:      According to their modelling, that size earthquake could cause shaking for nearly 2 minutes, said Jordan, with the strongest activity in the Coachella Valley, Inland Empire and Antelope Valley.      The reason Los Angeles is at so much risk is because it's built over a sedimentary basin, and the seismic waves spread and get trapped there to cause more extreme and longer-lasting shaking. As you can see in the magnitude 8.0 simulation:      While Jordan praised recent initiatives to earthquake retrofit buildings in LA, he warned that the rest of the state needs to get ready for the next big one, by making residents more aware of ways to stay safe during an earthquake and when and how to evacuate.      \\"We are fortunate that seismic activity in California has been relatively low over the past century,\\" Jordan explained last year. \\"But we know that tectonic forces are continually tightening the springs of the San Andreas fault system, making big quakes inevitable.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The San Andreas fault in California is very famous and it's the longest fault in the state. It has been very quiet for a long time and that worries scientists, because it should be relieving pressure through earthquakes. The last big earthquake on the southern section happened in 1857 and it was really strong. It's been too quiet, so experts say it's \\"locked, loaded, and ready to go,\\" which means a big earthquake might happen soon. Los Angeles should be prepared for a really big one, maybe around a magnitude 8, because it could cause a lot of damage and it's important to stay safe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write highlights for this article: Just when many colleges have started sending out their acceptances, director Paul Weitz's \\"Admission,\\" a comedy set in a fictionalized Princeton University admissions office, has debuted in movie theaters across the country. The film is off to a so-so start at the box office, but its timing could not be better for drawing in high school seniors and their parents. Tina Fey, in the role of Portia Nathan, an admissions officer with a screwball love life, gives us a lot to laugh at in \\"Admission,\\" but as a college professor who has served on his school's admissions committee, I found myself doing more squirming than laughing as I watched the film. What had me squirming was the focus of \\"Admission,\\" Portia's efforts to gain entry into Princeton for Jeremiah Balakian, a brilliant student, who was a screwup at his local New Hampshire high school but who has found himself at Quest, a nearby progressive, prep school. Jeremiah is the classic diamond in the rough. He has gotten fives on all his advanced placement tests, despite never having taken an AP course, and he is near 800 (the top score) on his College Boards. But Portia, whose motives for helping Jeremiah are personal and professional, cannot convince her fellow admissions officers that Jeremiah is right for Princeton. After they vote to reject him, she takes matters into her own hands. In the middle of the night, she sneaks into the Princeton admissions office and changes Jeremiah's folder from deny to accept. The result is a blessing for Jeremiah but the end of Portia's career in college admissions. What worried me -- and will, I assume, worry high school students and their parents -- is the film's implication that the only way a diamond in the rough gets into a college such as Princeton is through an admissions officer willing to sacrifice her best interests. My Harvard undergraduate experience, as well as my current Sarah Lawrence experience, tells me that admissions officers are a lot smarter than \\"Admission\\" suggests. The admission officers I know find it easy to advocate for the student with great grades or the 220-pound halfback who likes physics or the cellist who has played in the local symphony, but their eureka moment comes in discovering the promising student everyone else has ignored. Still, I take the larger point of \\"Admission\\" -- namely, these days getting into a prestigious college has become a blood sport. As Portia tells herself in the Jean Hanff Korelitz novel on which \\"Admission\\" is based, \\"The system as far as she was concerned was not about the applicant at all. It was about the institution. It was about delivering to the trustees, and to a lesser extent the faculty, a United Nations of scholars, an Olympiad of athletes, a conservatory of artists and musicians, a Great Society of strivers.\\" Colleges want students who will enhance their ratings and their brand, which means many worthy applicants get left behind. At the country's most selective colleges and universities, only 3 percent of the students come from the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. Even worse, at all too many high schools, it is hard for aspiring students to get help on their college applications. A 2010 Public Agenda study found that across the nation the ratio of high school students to guidance counselors was 460 to 1. What are good students and their parents supposed to do then? Here \\"Admission\\" provides no checklist of answers, but its satire on the workings of a fictionalized Princeton (last year the real Princeton took in just 2,095 of the 26,664 who applied), provides solid, commonsense advice. \\"Admission\\" tells students and their parents that although the Princetons of America offer a great education, those who obsess over gaining admission to them are, in most cases, headed for disappointment. They are letting themselves play a game in which there are certain to be more losers than winners. Equally important, \\"Admission\\" asserts that landing a spot in a prestigious college (Portia is a Dartmouth graduate) does not guarantee a happy post-college life. Indeed, if there is an overriding message in \\"Admission,\\" it is: Don't lose perspective. The one truly shallow moment in the film comes when the director of Princeton admissions complains to his staff that U.S. News & World Report has lowered Princeton to No. 2 in its rankings. The director is deeply upset by the downgrade. He believes, as all too many parents and their children do in real life, that the quality of an education can be measured like a baseball batting average or the carats in a diamond ring. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","output":"\\"Admission,\\" a comedy film directed by Paul Weitz and set in a fictionalized Princeton University admissions office, has debuted in movie theaters across the country, just as many colleges are sending out their acceptances.

In the third quarter, the Bengals trailed as RB Edgerrin James gave Arizona a 3-yard TD run. Cincinnati tried to rally as Palmer completed a 37-yard TD pass to WR Chris Henry, while RB DeDe Dorsey returned a blocked punt 19 yards for a touchdown. The Cardinals sealed the win with Rolle returning an interception 54 yards for a touchdown. Question: How many yards longer was the longest interception return touchdown than the shortest?

Attendance: 39,149. ‘I had a good meeting with Mike and Howard and got a bit of clarification,’ he said. ‘We were having a lot of wrong decisions in a short period that was hurting us.’ On Saturday's two major talking points, Monk did not offer any defence on behalf of Shelvey, who received a yellow card for foolishly kicking the ball away and then a second for grappling with James McCarthy as the Everton midfielder burst towards the penalty area. But he was incredulous that Antolin Alcaraz’s handball to block Shelvey’s shot in the first half had not been spotted by referee Kevin Friend. ‘I didn’t know you could play with two goalkeepers,’ he smiled. ‘He [Alcaraz] actually saved the ball. It was a good strong wrist. I’ll be showing my goalkeepers that’s how you do it. It was a clear penalty. ‘I’m not particularly complaining about the sending off. You can’t kick the ball away for the first yellow, it is something he [Shelvey] needs to learn from. But the way things are going for us at the moment, any time we make contact on a yellow card, it then becomes a red. ‘But we have to help ourselves get over the periods where the odd 50-50 goes against us. And we did that today — defensively we were brilliant.’ Roberto Martinez cut his managerial teeth at Swansea and set down the template for slick passing and good attacking movement. But after managerial stints by Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup, Monk, a former centre-half, has improved Swansea’s defensive qualities. He was proud of the way his players threw their bodies in the path of the ball on countless occasions to block out an Everton side trying to make their extra man count in the final 18 minutes. ‘I’ve played in many Swansea teams that played attractive football but sometimes we didn’t do enough work defensively. It is something I brought in. There are times where we can’t play free-flowing football and if we hadn’t done that work on our shape, we would have lost games like this.’ Martinez was not flattering about what he saw from his former club. Military veterans and players observe a minute's silence to mark Remembrance Day between Everton and Swansea at Goodison Park. Two opposition managers Roberto Martinez and Garry Monk embrace before the match between the two sides gets underway. Jefferson Montero of Swansea and James McCarthy of Everton battle for the ball during the first half with the score at 0-0. Swansea forward Wilfried Bony attempts a shot while Everton midfielder Gareth Barry launches in to try and stop him. Everton's Samuel Eto'o (bottom) is brought down by Swansea's Ki Sung-yeung while Shelvey watches on. Ross Barkley (middle) attempts to take the ball past Swansea full back Angel Rangel during the first half of the match. Everton's defender Antolin Alcaraz is treated on the Goodison Park pitch before being substituted after half an hour. ‘There were organised but that’s not what you’d normally highlight from a Swansea team. It was strange to see them play like that.’ It smacked of our sour grapes and perhaps Martinez is concerned his own side have just one Premier League win at Goodison Park this season. True, Swansea did not have a shot on target but they deserved a penalty and had the game’s clearest chance when Wilfried Bony shot wide after being put clean through by Gylfi Sigurdsson. Wayne Routledge (left) attempts to control a bouncing ball in front of Everton right back Seamus Coleman. The Everton fans watch on in the sunshine as their side attempt to break the deadlock against Swansea in the first half. Steven Naismith of Everton is marked at a corner by  Ki, Shelvey and goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski of Swansea City. Everton's Eto'o has a word in midfielder Ross Barkley's ear during the second half with the deadlock yet to be broken. Swansea winger Routledge (right) pulls the ball out of the air in the Everton half during the second half. Everton’s game was more about half-chances. Aiden McGeady’s shot was saved by Lukasz Fabianski and Leighton Baines fired wide with a free-kick. MINS PLD    KM    MILES. Everton                                   105.6    65.6.

They did press more right at the end but Romelu Lukaku, on the bench until the final quarter, inadvertently blocked Baines’s shot in added time and then failed to get a touch on a Samuel Eto’o cross. ‘The way we moved the ball wasn’t quick enough,’ admitted the Everton manager. ‘Swansea defended well, you have to give them credit. But we had bad fortune, too. Leighton had a good angle at the end but his shot hit Romelu’s legs.’ Martinez was also disappointed to see Alcaraz leave the action clutching his shoulder. He faces another prolonged spell on the sidelines after falling badly as he challenged Bony in the air. ‘He has damaged his joint in the shoulder and he is going to be out for a long spell. It is a real negative for us,’ said Martinez. Shelvey, 22, might have feared he had cost his side the game when he was ordered off 18 minutes from the end. He has already picked up 22 bookings and two red cards in his short career and, as an ex-Liverpool player, he was booed all the way to the dressing-room by Everton fans. But his team-mates did him proud as they kept Everton at bay. Martinez said: ‘I’m disappointed as I thought it was going to be more of a spectacle but it didn’t turn out to be. I thought we were a little frustrated.’ Thanks to his players’ resilience, Monk could afford to let the officials off this time. ‘I have just told my players they will never win a harder-earned point,’ he said.

Sentence from a movie review: the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the sentence from the movie review, it appears that the movie was seen negatively. The language used in the review, such as \\"tiresome,\\" \\"rant,\\" and \\"aging filmmaker,\\" suggests that the reviewer did not enjoy the movie and found the filmmaker's approach to be unimpressive or ineffective. Additionally, the phrase \\"still thumbing his nose at convention\\" implies that the filmmaker has maintained a rebellious or unconventional approach throughout his career, but in this specific instance, the reviewer perceives this continued defiance as a negative aspect rather than a refreshing or innovative quality. In conclusion, the combination of critical language and the allusion to the filmmaker's approach to convention indicate that the movie received an unfavorable response from the reviewer. It is possible that other aspects of the film might be praised by the reviewer, but the mentioned sentence points to a negative outlook on the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hamilton argued that the natural faculties of blacks were as good as those of free whites, and he warned that the British would arm the slaves if the patriots did not. In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable. Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks. In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS). John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president. Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates. Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York. In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina. He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument. Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves. Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries. In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791--both measures hurt France. Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees).

Cardboard is like a thick paper, easy to cut, and can be found in boxes you see around the house. If you choose this way, it'll be easier to make, lighter to carry, and safer to play with. Option 2: You can use metal to create the picture. Metal is a strong, shiny material that can be found in things like pots and pans. If you choose this way, it'll be heavier, harder to make, and you need to be more careful not to hurt yourself while playing with it.

The subjects in the two sentences are different. In the first sentence, the subject is 'a cat'. In the second sentence, the subject is 'a woman'. On the face of it, a cat and a woman are two distinct entities of different species.      2. The verbs in the two sentences (is playing) are the same. The verb refers to engagement in some sort of activity. However, the context of the verb ('playing') in both sentences is different. A cat playing typically refers to a physical action like playing with a ball of yarn. A woman playing the flute is a creative action referring to the creation of music. 3. The objects in each sentence are different too. While in the first case it is implicit (plaything or toy), in the second it is explicit and specifically a 'flute,' an instrument. 4. The overall meanings of both sentences are quite different. The first one describes a scenario of a pet engaging in play, and the second one describes a musical performance. Based on these observations, although they both use the verb 'playing', the context and application of 'playing' is different, as are the subjects and objects.

The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go. Answer:","output":"Quaife"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you prepare celery for cooking or eating?","output":"There are two primary methods to consider for preparing celery for cooking or eating: a Fresh and Crunchy method, ideal for using celery in salads or as a raw snack, and a Cooked and Tender method, perfect for incorporating in stews, soups, and braised dishes. While both methods optimize the texture of celery, the choice between them ultimately depends on your preferences and the specific dish you intend to prepare. Let's delve into both methods to understand their benefits and applications. 1. Fresh and Crunchy Method: This method focuses on maintaining the crispiness of the celery. It is suitable for dishes where raw celery is desired, such as salads, dips, garnishes, or snacks. Here's how to prepare celery using this method: a. Rinse and clean: Begin by removing any dirt, particles, or pesticides by rinsing the celery stalks thoroughly under cold, running water. You can also use a produce cleaning spray or a mixture of water and white vinegar to provide a deeper cleanse. b. Trim the ends: Using a sharp knife, cut off the root end (the white, wider bottom part) and the leafy end. These parts of the celery may taste slightly bitter and are often discarded, but they can also be saved for making stock or broth, if desired. c. De-string: Some people find the fibrous strings that run along the celery stalk to be tough or unpleasant to eat. To remove them, use a vegetable peeler (or the tip of a knife) to gently pull away the strings from the stalk, starting from the cut end and working your way to the top, following the natural ridges of the celery. d. Chop or slice: Depending on your dish or preference, cut the celery into desired shapes and sizes, such as small dices for a salad, long diagonal cuts for a crudité platter, or thin slices for garnishing. e. Optional soak: If you want to ensure even more crunch and freshness to your celery, soak the prepared stalks in ice-cold water for about 15-20 minutes before using. This helps restore any lost moisture, making the celery more appealing and enhancing its natural crunch. 2. Cooked and Tender Method: This method aims to soften the celery's texture, making it blend seamlessly into cooked dishes such as soups, stews, and stir-fries. Here's how to prepare celery using this method: a. Rinse and clean: Just as in the Fresh and Crunchy method, begin by thoroughly rinsing the celery to remove any dirt or particles. b. Trim the ends: Cut off the root and leafy ends of the stalks. c. Chop or slice: Unlike the Fresh and Crunchy method, de-stringing is often not necessary for cooked dishes, as the fibers will soften during the cooking process. Depending on your recipe, cut the celery into desired shapes and sizes, such as short uniform pieces for a soup, thin slices for a stir-fry, or larger chunks for a stew. d. Cook: You can now incorporate the prepared celery into your recipe, by sautéing, boiling, steaming, or whichever cooking method the dish requires. Cooking will soften the celery, subdue its flavors, and add a natural hint of sweetness. In conclusion, the best method for preparing celery depends on your intended use of celery in your dish. For raw applications that showcase celery's fresh crunch, choose the Fresh and Crunchy method. However, for cooked dishes where tender, softened celery is desired, opt for the Cooked and Tender method."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Vikings too seemed to also be able to move the ball just as effectively with multiple short runs by running back Adrian Peterson and throws by Brett Favre. The Vikings finally capped the 12-play, 67-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown pass short left from Brett Favre to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. With the score, the Vikings took the early 7-0 lead. The Packers then took to the field looking to make up for the turnover on their first possession of the game. On 3rd and 5 after an incompletion to Greg Jennings and a 5-yard run by fullback John Kuhn, Aaron Rodgers fired a pass to second year tight end Jermichael Finley deep middle in which he caught around the Vikings 35-yard line and then ran the ball the rest of the way into the end zone for a Packers 62-yard touchdown. With the extra point the game was now tied 7-7. The Vikings took to the field again, but after two incompletions and a completion for a 5-yard loss the Vikings were forced to punt. The Packers then took over at the Minnesota 43-yard line. The Packers again managed to move the ball quite effectively against the Vikings defense but like the first drive of the game, the drive ended with a turn over. This time it was an attempted short right pass to Greg Jennings from Aaron Rodgers that was intercepted by Antoine Winfield at the Vikings 23-yard line. Similar to the last drive after the Packers turned over the ball, the Vikings managed to move the ball effortlessly down to the Packers 14-yard line in which Brett Favre then connected with wide receiver Sidney Rice for Favre's second touchdown strike against the Packers. With the score the Vikings retook the lead at 14-7. The Packers then took to the field looking again to make up for another costly turnover, but the offense failed to move the ball and Aaron Rodgers was sacked on 3rd down forcing the Packers to punt. The Packers would level the score though on the Vikings next offensive play of the game. Vikings running back Adrian Peterson ran wide left and was stacked up behind the line of scrimmage. While he was being stopped, Packers rookie linebacker Clay Matthews ripped the ball away from Peterson and returned the ball untouched 42 yards for the Packers tying touchdown at 14-14. On the Vikings next possession looking to retake the lead, Favre and company compiled together a drive highlighted by a 43-yard pass from Brett Favre to Percy Harvin down to the Packers 3-yard line. On the next play, Favre dropped back to pass and the ball was intercepted by Packers cornerback Charles Woodson in the center of the end zone but the play was nullified by a defensive pass interference call paired with a defensive offside penalty. The pass inference penalty was accepted and the ball was placed on the Packers 1-yard line. On the next play Vikings running back Adrian Peterson rushed up the middle for the score to give the Vikings a 21-14 lead. The Packers took over with little time remaining but still attempted to put points on the board. After a 14-yard pass to Greg Jennings down to the Vikings 48-yard line, Aaron Rodgers took the team's final timeout with 1 second remaining. On the final play of the half Rodgers tossed a deep ball into a group of players the right corner of the end zone but the ball fell incomplete ending the half 21-14 in favor of the Vikings. The Vikings received the ball at the start of the second half, and managed to still move the ball effectively against the Packers defense that was getting virtually no pressure on Brett Favre. On second and ten at the Green Bay 44-yard line, Brett Favre connected with Jeff Dugan to the Green Bay 31 for 25 yards and then capped the drive with a 31-yard strike to receiver Bernard Berrian deep left for a touchdown to extend the Vikings lead to 28-14. The Packers then took to the field and managed to move the ball down field highlighted by a 24-yard pass to Donald Driver and a 20-yard pass to Ryan Grant down to the Minnesota 5-yard line setting the team up first and goal at the Vikings 5-yard line. On first down Ryan Grant ran up the middle for a four-yard gain. On second down the Packers tried a trick play that looked like a run wide right for Grant, but Rodgers handed the ball off to fullback John Kuhn who ran up the middle but the Vikings were not fooled and Kuhn's attempt to score a touchdown was stopped when his knee hit down at the line of scrimmage before lunging into the endzone. On third down, Rodgers connected with tight end Jermichael Finley who ran an out route to the right, but was tackled right after the reception at the line of scrimmage by Vikings linebacker Ben Leber for no gain. The Packers then choose to go for it on fourth down rather than settling the field goal. On the play, Rodgers looked right, then back left and passed to Packers tight end Donald Lee short middle, but Lee failed to catch the pass resulting in loss of downs and the Vikings took over possession at their 1-yard line. On the Vikings next drive that continued on into the final quarter of play, the Vikings managed to move the ball out of their own end zone down to their own 37-yard line, but the drive stalled on a 5-yard completed screen pass short of the first down marker on 3rd and 10. The Packers took over at their own 15-yard line, and Rodgers was sacked on first down. On second down Ryan Grant ran up the middle for 10 yards making up for the lost yardage on the sack and more. The drive came to an end though on the next play when quarterback Aaron Rodgers pretended to walk toward the sideline and the ball was directly snapped to backup running back DeShawn Wynn. Wynn managed to gain 6 yards on 3rd and 7, but falling a yard short on the trick play the Packers were forced to punt. The Viking offense then took to the field again, but the Packers defense held the Vikings on third down and they too were forced to punt. After another stellar punt by Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, the Packers were again pinned deep in their own end at their own 1-yard line. After two unsuccessful plays for no gain on first and second down, Aaron Rodgers was sacked by Jared Allen at the goal line and fumbled the football. The ball was recovered by the Vikings, but the ruling on the field was challenged by the Packers that the ground had caused the fumbled. The ruling on the field was then changed to a safety rather than giving the Vikings the ball at the Packers 1-yard line and the Vikings extended their lead to 30-14. After the safety the Packers kicked off and the Vikings took over at their 40-yard line.The Packers managed to again hold the Vikings defense to a three and out and the ball was punted back to the Packers. On the Packers next possession, Ryan Grant started off the drive with a 15-yard run, and Jermichael Finley caught a 37-yard pass from Rodgers two plays later. Three plays later after an 11-yard rush by Aaron Rodgers and an incomplete pass, Rodgers connected with second year wide receiver Jordy Nelson for a 33-yard touchdown strike. After a failed two-point conversion pass to Ryan Grant the Vikings lead was decreased to 30-20. The Packers then tried a failed onside kick and the Vikings took over the ball with 3:39 remaining in the game, but due to poor clock management by the Vikings they were held to a three and out and only had run 29 seconds off of the game clock after the punt. The Packers took over at their own 18-yard line with 3:10 remaining in the contest. On first play of the drive, Rodgers connected with Donald Driver for 10 yards which with the reception tied Sterling Sharpe's club career high receptions total with 595. On third and 12 at their own 26-yard line, Rodgers hit James Jones in the middle of the field in which he then took the ball to the Minnesota 40 for 34 yards. Five plays later after Rodgers threw the ball away on third down, Mason Crosby converted a 31-yard field goal to decrease the Vikings lead to 30-23. The Packers attempted their second onside kick of the game with 55 seconds remaining, but the kick was again recovered by the Vikings ending all chances of a comeback. The Vikings then lined up in the victory formation and ran out the clock to defeat the Packers 30-23. During the contest, Packers return specialist Will Blackmon suffered a season ending knee injury. With the loss, the Packers go into their bye week with a 2-2 record sitting in third place in the NFC North behind the 4-0 Minnesota Vikings and the 3-1 Chicago Bears.

Thad on Gunsmoke, an American television western series which originally aired on CBS network from 1955 to 1975. Gunsmoke is one of the longest-running primetime television series of all time and is notable for its vivid character development, engaging storylines, and memorable performances. Roger Ewing was born on January 12, 1942, in Los Angeles, California. He joined the cast of Gunsmoke in its twelfth season and appeared in a total of 54 episodes between 1966 and 1968. Thad Greenwood, the character portrayed by Ewing, was a part-time Deputy Marshal under the leadership of the show's main protagonist, Marshal Matt Dillon (played by James Arness). Thad's character was introduced to make up for the absence of Dennis Weaver's Chester Goode, who had been Dillon's previous deputy. Thad Greenwood was a tall, quiet, and competent lawman, honest to the core, and loyal to his friends. While Thad was not a prominent character like Marshal Dillon or Festus Haggen (played by Ken Curtis), his role was significant in assisting the main characters in various situations and maintaining law and order in the fictional town of Dodge City, Kansas. Roger Ewing's portrayal of Thad Greenwood provided a fresh perspective to the series and added a younger, more enthusiastic lawman to the mix of seasoned characters. Ewing's acting career, however, was relatively short-lived. After leaving Gunsmoke in 1968, he appeared in only a few other projects before retiring from acting in the early 1970s. Despite his brief acting career, Ewing's contribution to Gunsmoke through his portrayal of Thad Greenwood is fondly remembered by fans of the show."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.  - Air Vice Marshal Sir Charles Alexander Holcombe Longcroft KCB , CMG , DSO , AFC ( 13 May 1883 -- 20 February 1958 ) was a pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps who went on to become a senior commander in the Royal Air Force .  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world.

Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War, until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force. During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transportation facilities.

Your task is to summarize them. Input: CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - About 300 protesters took to the streets of Charlotte, North Carolina, in a fourth night of demonstrations on Friday, calling on authorities to “release the tapes” of the fatal police shooting of a black man, hours after his family released its own video.      Protesters gathered after nightfall in a small park and others chalked the names of police shooting victims from across the country on a street, but there was no sign of the violence that marked demonstrations earlier in the week.      Protesters marched under the eye of armed National Guard troops, chanting “Resist the police” along with calls for videos of Tuesday’s shooting of Keith Scott, a 43-year-old father of seven, to be made public.      Charlotte police have claimed that Scott was armed with a gun, which the family has denied.      Police officers and protesters, both on bicycles, led the way through streets closed to traffic. Marchers briefly entered an interstate highway running through the city but quickly returned to the local streets.      The two-minute video recorded by Scott’s wife, Rakeyia, includes audio of her pleading with officers to hold fire as they confront Scott in a parked car outside a Charlotte apartment complex.      “Don’t shoot him! He has no weapon,” she can be heard telling officers as they yell at Scott, “Drop the gun!”      Scott’s death was the latest in a string of police killings of black men in America, which have unleashed protests and riots across the country and led to international criticism of the United States’ treatment of minorities.      Over the last two years, protesters have filled streets from Milwaukee to Minneapolis, from Ferguson, Missouri, to Baltimore. Protesters have also taken to the streets in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where police officers were shot and killed by gunmen who claimed to be avenging the deaths of black men unjustly slain by law enforcement.      In the Charlotte video, released by the family to U.S. media outlets, Scott’s wife can be heard shouting “Keith, Keith, don’t do it,” although it is not clear whether she is directing her comments to her husband or police. The footage captures the sound of four shots but does not show Scott being hit. It is also not clear from the footage whether he is in possession of a gun.      Scott’s wife in the video also tells police that her husband had a TBI, or traumatic brain injury, and had just taken “his medicine.” It was not clear from the video whether police heard the wife nor the nature of any injury Scott may have sustained.      CNN quoted a source close to the Charlotte investigation as saying that a loaded gun had been recovered at the scene of the crime and that fingerprints, DNA and blood on it matched Scott’s.      Reuters was unable to confirm the report and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department did not immediately respond to queries on it.      VIDEO FOOTAGE NO “PANACEA”      Along with Scott’s family, protesters have dismissed the police claim that Scott had a gun and have called on authorities to release video taken by law enforcement to shed light on the controversy.      Protesters hold signs while marching to demonstrate against the police shooting of Keith Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S., September 23, 2016. REUTERS/Jason Miczek      The family initially contended that Scott was carrying a book, but after viewing the police video on Thursday, the family said it was “impossible to discern” what, if anything, Scott was carrying.      “There’s nothing in that video that shows him acting aggressively, threatening or maybe dangerous,” Justin Bamberg, one of the lawyers representing the family, said in an interview early on Friday.      Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts on Friday also called for release of the police videos. “I do think it would help in terms of transparency to release that footage,” she said in an interview with CNN. Roberts has seen two police videos as well as the family one. “All three videos I’ve seen are inconclusive,” she said on CNN.      Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney has said that video taken by police body cameras supported the police version of events but was not a “panacea”. He told reporters on Friday that releasing the footage now could harm the investigation, which the state is leading.      Putney said that he would eventually agree with the release of the video. “It’s a matter of when and a matter of sequence.”      State police in a statement on Friday said that local police had the legal authority to release the tapes.      Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton added her voice to calls for release “without delay” of the video. “We must ensure justice and work to bridge divides,” she said on Twitter on Friday.      Clinton initially announced plans earlier on Friday to go to Charlotte on Sunday. After Mayor Roberts publicly asked her to delay the trip, given demands on Charlotte’s resources, Clinton postponed the trip by a week to Oct. 1.      Slideshow (19 Images)      The demonstrations in Charlotte spread to Atlanta on Friday night, with about 250 protesters taking to the streets of downtown Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. ||||| PITTSBURGH (AP) — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is seeking to show law-and-order toughness along with empathy for African-Americans as he criticizes violent protests stemming from another fatal police shooting of a black man.      His Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, was behind closed doors as she prepared for their initial debate and did not address on Thursday the escalating racial tensions in Charlotte, North Carolina. The city was under a midnight curfew after two previous nights of chaotic protests that led to one death as well as injuries, arrests and vandalism.      Trump has spent the last several weeks asking black Americans for their support and asserting that President Barack Obama has failed the black community, but those appeals have been undermined at times. On Thursday, the Trump campaign accepted the resignation of an Ohio volunteer, Mahoning County chair Kathy Miller, who told the Guardian newspaper, \\"I don't think there was any racism until Obama got elected.\\"      Trump himself sent a mixed and at times unclear message that could rankle African-Americans even as he called for a nation united in \\"the spirit of togetherness.\\"      \\"The rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens and it must be ended and ended now,\\" the New York businessman declared at a rally in suburban Philadelphia on Thursday night. He added: \\"The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in safety and peace.\\"      Earlier in the day, however, Trump seemed to suggest that protesters outraged by the police shootings of black men were under the influence of drugs.      \\"I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country and poisoning our youth and many other people,\\" he said during an appearance at an energy conference in Pittsburgh. He added, \\"And if you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night.\\"      Trump's campaign said he was referring to news reports about the recent increase in drug-related deaths, not the protests seen on cable news the last few nights.      On Wednesday, Trump seemed to call for the national expansion of \\"stop-and-frisk,\\" a police tactic that has been condemned as racial profiling. He clarified on Thursday that he had been referring only to murder-plagued Chicago.      Clinton has made curbing gun violence and police brutality central to her candidacy. She said Wednesday that the shooting in North Carolina and a fatal shooting of a black man by a white police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, had added two more names \\"to a long list of African-Americans killed by police officers. It's unbearable and it needs to become intolerable.\\" The Tulsa officer has since been charged with first-degree manslaughter.      At his evening rally Thursday, Trump accused Clinton of supporting — \\"with a nod\\" — \\"the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society.\\"      \\"Those peddling the narrative ... share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have really the very least,\\" he said.

Thursday,... (Associated Press)      CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — A third night of protests over a fatal police shooting in Charlotte gave way to quiet streets early Friday after the city's mayor enacted a curfew and rifle-toting members of the National Guard arrived to guard the city's business district.      The largely peaceful Thursday night demonstrations called on police to release video that could resolve wildly different accounts of the shooting this week of a black man.      The family of Keith Lamont Scott, 43, was shown the footage Thursday of his fatal shooting and demanded that police release it to the public.      Demonstrators chanted \\"release the tape\\" and \\"we want the tape\\" Thursday while briefly blocking an intersection near Bank of America headquarters and later climbing the steps to the door of the city government center. Later, several dozen demonstrators walked onto an interstate highway through the city, but they were pushed back by police in riot gear.      Still, the protests lacked the violence and property damage of previous nights — and a midnight curfew enacted by the mayor encouraged a stopping point. Local officers' ranks were augmented by members of the National Guard carrying rifles and guarding office buildings against the threat of property damage.      Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts signed documents Thursday night for the citywide curfew that runs from midnight to 6 a.m. After the curfew took effect, police allowed the crowd of demonstrators to thin without forcing them off the street. Police Capt. Mike Campagna told reporters that officers would not seek to arrest curfew violators as long as they were peaceful.      So far, police have resisted releasing police dashcam and body camera footage of Scott's death earlier this week. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday that releasing the footage of Scott's killing could undermine the investigation. He told reporters the video will be made public when he believes there is a \\"compelling reason\\" to do so.      \\"You shouldn't expect it to be released,\\" Putney said. \\"I'm not going to jeopardize the investigation.\\"      Charlotte is the latest U.S. city to be shaken by protests and recriminations over the death of a black man at the hands of police, a list that includes Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, New York and Ferguson, Missouri. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Thursday, prosecutors charged a white officer with manslaughter for killing an unarmed black man on a city street last week.      Protests in Charlotte turned violent Wednesday as demonstrators attacked reporters and others, set fires and smashed windows of hotels, office buildings and restaurants in the city's bustling business district.      Forty-four people were arrested after Wednesday's protests, and one protester who was shot died at the hospital Thursday; city officials said police did not shoot the man and no arrests have been made in 26-year-old Justin Carr's death.      Police have said Scott was shot to death Tuesday by a black officer after he disregarded repeated warnings to drop his gun. Neighbors, though, have said he was holding only a book. The police chief said a gun was found next to the dead man, and there was no book.      Putney said he has seen the video and it does not contain \\"absolute, definitive evidence that would confirm that a person was pointing a gun.\\" But he added: \\"When taken in the totality of all the other evidence, it supports what we said.\\"      Justin Bamberg, an attorney for Scott's family, watched the video with the slain man's relatives. He said that in the video, Scott gets out of his vehicle calmly.      \\"While police did give him several commands, he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time. It is impossible to discern from the videos what, if anything, Mr. Scott is holding in his hands,\\" Bamberg said in a statement.      Scott was shot as he walked slowly backward with his hands by his side, Bamberg said.      The lawyer said at a news conference earlier in the day that Scott's wife saw him get shot, \\"and that's something she will never, ever forget.\\" That is the first time anyone connected with the case has said the wife witnessed the shooting. Bamberg gave no details on what the wife saw.      The police chief acknowledged that he has promised transparency in the investigation, but said, \\"I'm telling you right now, if you think I say we should display a victim's worst day for consumption, that is not the transparency I'm speaking of.\\"      ___      Associated Press writers Mitch Weiss, Meg Kinnard, Seanna Adcox, Jeffrey Collins, Jack Jones and Gary Robertson contributed to this report. ||||| Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) Relatives of Keith Lamont Scott, after watching two police videos, said they couldn't say what was in his hands when he was shot and killed by a Charlotte police officer.      \\"It is impossible to discern from the videos what, if anything, Mr. Scott is holding in his hands,\\" attorney Justin Bamberg said.      The family wants police to immediately release the videos to the public, Bamberg said.      But Charlotte-Mecklenberg police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters earlier Thursday that he's not going to do that because he doesn't want to jeopardize the investigation.      Asked whether there was a time at which the public could expect to see it, Putney said there should be no such expectation.      \\"Transparency's in the eye of the beholder,\\" he said. \\"If you think we should display a victim's worst day for public consumption, that is not the transparency I'm speaking of.\\"      Putney later told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the decision wouldn't be his to make much longer anyway, as the investigation was being turned over to North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation.      Putney said video does not provide \\"definitive visual evidence\\" that Scott pointed a gun at police officers, including Brentley Vinson, who shot Scott. But other evidence and witness accounts support the police narrative that officers opened fire only after Scott refused to drop his weapon, he said.      The family says the video shows Scott acting calmly and non-aggressively on Tuesday. \\"When he was shot and killed, Mr. Scott's hands were by his side and he was slowly walking backwards,\\" Bamberg said.      Scott didn't own a gun or habitually carry a gun, the family has told their attorneys, Bamberg said. Scott's family has said he was reading a book in his vehicle when officers approached.      Mayor Jennifer Roberts also watched the videos.      \\"It is not a very clear picture, and the gun in question is a small gun and it was not easy to see with the way the motion was happening,\\" she told \\"Anderson Cooper 360.\\"      The mayor said she is leaning toward releasing the footage to the public, but must remain mindful of the ongoing investigations into Scott's shooting.      Shooting victim dies      The man shot outside Charlotte's Omni Hotel during Wednesday night's violent protests over Scott's death has died, police public information officer Robert Tufano told CNN.      The victim was identified as Justin Carr, 26, from Charlotte.      Carr was discovered at the Omni Hotel uptown, and because the crowd was too thick for paramedics to access the scene, he had to be evacuated by a SWAT armored personnel carrier, the chief said. Authorities have said he was shot by another civilian.

On Wednesday, police arrested 44 people at the protests, one of which turned into a riot. People smashed windows, looted storefronts and threw objects at others and police.      Roberts has signed an order enacting a curfew for the city, an aide told CNN. The curfew goes into effect at midnight and extends until 6 a.m. ET.      \\"The curfew will be in effect each day until the end of the State of Emergency is declared or until the official proclamation is revoked,\\" the city tweeted.      Several hundred people gathered Thursday night on streets in uptown Charlotte; the demonstrations appeared largely peaceful.      Putney used a news conference to send a message to those who would continue looting and destroying property in the city, which also resulted in injuries to nine civilians and five police officers.      Two of the officers suffered minor eye injuries, while three others had heat-related ailments.      JUST WATCHED CNN reporters tear gassed, knocked over Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN reporters tear gassed, knocked over 01:13      Wednesday's protests began peacefully, the chief said, but about 8 p.m. demonstrators began jumping on cars and damaging property at EpiCentre, an entertainment hub uptown. Police were forced to deploy tear gas, he said, and as the night went on, protesters shut down Interstate 277 and the city's light rail was halted just before midnight, due to the demonstrations, Putney said.      The violence and vandalism carried on until roughly 3 a.m., he said. The arrests ran the gamut from failing to disperse to assault to breaking and entering, and more arrests may come as authorities review video footage of the protests, he said.      Those looking to repeat the tumult will do so under an increased police presence Thursday night. There will be officers on foot and bike patrol, as well as dirt bikes. Helicopters will patrol the streets from above, and police will have more than 1,000 cameras to help monitor the city, Putney said.      Charlotte-Mecklenburg police Officer Brentley Vinson      The National Guard and state police will protect buildings and infrastructure so the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police can \\"focus on the people who are committing crimes, who are damaging property and assaulting our people,\\" he said.      Guard troops were seen arriving Thursday afternoon and the state was in the process of activating 316 troops for security and crowd control.      What's on the video?      Keith Lamont Scott, shown with his wife, Rakeyia Scott.      While the public shouldn't expect to see the video, Todd Walther, spokesman for the Charlotte Fraternal Order of Police, told CNN that he viewed the footage, and it demonstrated Scott was \\"an obvious threat\\" to police officers. He said Scott can be seen with a gun and ankle holster in the video.      Scott was in a vehicle when police arrived to serve a warrant on another man at an apartment complex, he said. Some of the officers were not in uniform, but they still had vests or jackets that said \\"police\\" on the front and back, Walther said.      \\"He was seated in (the car) when he was approached, but when he exited that vehicle, he was given clear commands to drop the weapon -- and he did not do that,\\" Walther said. \\"So he was armed when he came out of that vehicle and refused to listen to officers.\\"      In a photo obtained by an affiliate WSOC source, a photo shows the scene where Keith Scott was fatally shot by police.

You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub! BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born. Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products. Here are some more examples: Jerry Yang and David Filo, two young computer specialists, developed a guide to Internet content in 1994. They called it \\"Jerry and David's Guide to World Wide Web.\\" But they soon realized that this wasn't a very catchy name, so they searched through a dictionary and found a better one: \\"Yahoo.\\" Sometimes companies change their names because of the popularity of one of their products.

Question: whom do emily see on the street again and attempts to press him for information Title: The House on Carroll Street Movie plot: Emily Crane (Kelly McGillis), a picture editor for Life magazine], is fired after refusing to give names to a 1951 House Un-American Activities Committee and takes a part-time job as companion to an old lady. One day her attention is drawn to a noisy argument being conducted in a neighboring house. She eavesdrops through an open window, seeing that one of those involved is her main senator prosecutor, Ray Salwen (Mandy Patinkin). His opponent is an elderly man who speaks only German; a younger man named Stefan (Christopher Buchholz), whom Emily had earlier asked for directions, is interpreting their confrontation. Emily meets Stefan on the street again and attempts to press him for information; when he rebuffs her, she follows him to a cemetery, where he demands to know why she is interested. They arrange a later meeting at a book shop, but are accosted by two men claiming to be US Immigration agents, which a panicked Stefan denies. He and Emily escape their pursuit, but before Stefan can tell Emily more, he is murdered by a knife-wielding assassin. During the crime scene investigation, the police find a list of four names in Stefan's pocket, and Emily insists that they search the house where she overheard the argument. The police are skeptical of Emily's story, so she decides to search the house herself; the assassin reappears, but is thwarted by FBI agent Cochran (Jeff Daniels), who has been keeping an eye on Emily for several days. After a scuffle, the assassin flees, and Cochran takes Emily home â but not before she picks up a book with a woman's name and a date written inside the cover. Cochran and his partner, Hackett (Kenneth Welsh), deduce that the name is actually that of a ship, and that it will be arriving in the Port of New York City the next day.

A. introducing yourself  B. smiling  C. shake hands  D. share a hug  E. talking  The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is C. Shake hands. When people meet each other, whether in a professional, social, or any other setting, the most common physical gesture is to shake hands. Shaking hands is a globally recognized way of greeting someone and shows respect, trust, and acknowledgment. It helps create an instant connection and paves the way for further communication. Let's examine the other options as well: A. Introducing yourself: Introducing yourself is a verbal gesture, not a physical one. While it is important to introduce yourself when meeting someone new, the question specifically asks about physical gestures. B. Smiling: Smiling is a friendly way to greet someone and is often used in conjunction with other physical gestures, such as a handshake or a nod. However, a smile on its own might not be sufficient to establish a connection with someone you just met, and a handshake is still a more universally recognized way of greeting someone. D. Share a hug: Hugging can be a common physical gesture among close friends or family members. However, it is not considered appropriate when meeting someone for the first time, particularly in a professional or formal setting. Hugging can be perceived as too intimate or invasive, which is why a handshake is more suitable when making initial contact. E. Talking: Talking, like introducing yourself, is a verbal gesture and not a physical one. Communicating verbally is essential when meeting new people, but it doesn't address the need for a physical gesture when greeting someone. In conclusion, while some of the other options might be observed during people's interactions, the most likely and appropriate physical gesture when meeting someone for the first time is to shake hands. It provides a perfect balance of familiarity, respect, and professionalism, making it suitable for different types of encounters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does it follow that \\"Small parties were easier to host than large ones.\\"?","output":"To determine whether the statement \\"Small parties were easier to host than large ones\\" follows from \\"Apache war parties are never large,\\" let's analyze the two statements step-by-step: 1. Understand the context of each statement.     - The first statement is about Apache war parties, which are specific gatherings, and is based on information about the size of these gatherings.     - The second statement is a generalization about small parties versus large parties, not specifically referring to Apache war parties or any other specific type of gathering. 2. Compare the contexts to see if they are related.     - The first statement is about a specific type of gathering (Apache war parties), while the second statement makes a general claim about the relative ease of hosting gatherings based on size.     - There is a connection between the two statements in terms of size (large versus small), but they do not necessarily address the same concept (ease of hosting). 3. Assess whether one statement can be derived from the other.     - The initial statement provides information about the size of Apache war parties, but it does not directly address the ease of hosting them or any other type of gathering.     - The second statement is a general claim that could potentially apply to Apache war parties, but it cannot be directly derived from the information provided in the first statement. Based on this analysis, it does not follow that \\"Small parties were easier to host than large ones\\" from the statement \\"Apache war parties are never large,\\" since the first statement does not specifically address the ease of hosting these gatherings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Western Wall is located in the Old City of Jerusalem at the foot of the western side of the Temple Mount. It's particularly noteworthy because it's the only remaining part of the Second Holy Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE.  Due to its sacred status, the Western Wall has been a site of Jewish prayer and pilgrimage for centuries. People from around the world write prayers on slips of paper and then place them into the cracks in the wall, a custom known as placing kvitelach.  The Western Wall is divided into two sections: one area for men and another for women, reflecting Orthodox Jewish tradition. Its significance is not confined to Judaism only, it also holds a profound historical connection for Christians and Muslims alike.  For Christians, the Wall is a site associated with Jesus Christ, as he lived in Jerusalem at the same time as the Second Temple stood on Temple Mount. For Muslims, it's known as Buraq Wall and stands as the boundary of Al-Aqsa Mosque which holds its own significance in the Islamic faith as being the location where Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven during his Night Journey. Hence, the Western Wall is a venerable site of immense historical and religious importance. It bears testimony to various pivotal events that have shaped the religious, socio-cultural contours of not only Jerusalem but the world as a whole.  The old city of Jerusalem and its walls, including the Western Wall, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981 and it continues to attract millions of visitors each year who come to absorb its rich history, pray, remember, and reflect. In Israel's regular archaeological excavations, remnants from different periods are often found in the vicinity of the Western Wall adding layers to its already rich history.  A part of it also runs underground as the Western Wall Tunnels, which have been excavated and opened for the public, further encapsulating the timeless history buried within it.  Despite being at the center of various political and religious disputes, the Western Wall has withstood such challenges, standing tall as a cherished symbol of enduring faith and resilience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Determine which dishes will fit which food items. Disperse condiments evenly. Set up a dessert station away from the dinner table. Add the chairs around the table.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Guide to Organizing the Perfect Dinner Party Introduction A well-organized dinner party is not only enjoyable for your guests but also a rewarding experience for the host. It takes careful planning, attention to detail, and a few simple strategies to make sure everything goes smoothly. In this article, we'll explore how to determine which dishes will fit which food items, evenly disperse condiments, set up a dessert station, and arrange seating. By following these tips, you'll ensure that your dinner party is a delightful occasion for everyone involved. Step 1: Determine Which Dishes Will Fit Which Food Items The first step in creating a pleasing dinner arrangement is to decide on the appropriate dishes for each food item. This will ensure that the presentation is visually appealing, uncomplicated for guests to serve themselves, and easy to clean up afterward. Consider the size and shape of each dish, as well as how it will match the various food items. For example, large bowls or casseroles work well for salads, while smaller plates or platters are better suited for appetizers. Additionally, make sure to have the right utensils available for each dish for seamless serving. Step 2: Disperse Condiments Evenly An important aspect of a dinner party is making sure that all guests have easy access to condiments. Place condiments logically and evenly throughout the table so that every guest can reach them without stretching or needing to pass them around. You can use small, individual bowls, ramekins, or condiment dishes for items like dips, sauces, or dressings. Additionally, it's a good idea to have multiple sets of salt and pepper shakers or small stacks of napkins placed at strategic points. Step 3: Set up a Dessert Station Away from the Dinner Table Keeping the dessert station separate from the dinner table is a nice touch that adds an extra element of excitement to the evening. This allows guests to enjoy their meal fully, and it keeps the dessert as a delightful surprise for later. Set up a separate table or cart for desserts, complete with serving utensils, plates, and necessary garnishes like whipped cream or fruit. You can also prepare a coffee or tea station alongside the desserts to give guests the option of a warm beverage as they enjoy their sweet treat. Step 4: Add Chairs Around the Table Finally, carefully consider the seating arrangement for your dinner party. Ensure that you have enough chairs for all your guests and position them comfortably around the table. When planning the seating arrangement, it's crucial to keep in mind any special requirements or preferences your guests might have. For example, if you have guests with limited mobility, make sure they have easy access to their seat and are situated near the end of the table. Conclusion With the right planning and attention to detail, you can create a memorable dinner party that your guests will enjoy and appreciate. By determining the appropriate dishes for each food item, dispersing condiments evenly, setting up a separate dessert station, and arranging seating thoughtfully, you'll demonstrate your skills as a thoughtful and considerate host. Get ready to impress your friends and family with an unforgettable dining experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information:  - Felice Varini ( born in Locarno in 1952 ) is a Paris - based , Swiss artist who was nominated for the 2000/2001 Marcel Duchamp Prize . Mostly known for his geometric perspective - localized paintings in rooms and other spaces , using projector - stencil techniques , according to mathematics professor and art critic Joël Koskas , \`\` A work of Varini is an anti-Mona Lisa . '' Felice paints on architectural and urban spaces , such as buildings , walls and streets . The paintings are characterized by one vantage point from which the viewer can see the complete painting ( usually a simple geometric shape such as circle , square , line ) , while from other view points the viewer will see \`\` broken '' fragmented shapes . Varini argues that the work exists as a whole - with its complete shape as well as the fragments . \`\` My concern , '' he says \`\` is what happens outside the vantage point of view . ''  - Henri-Robert-Marcel Duchamp (28 July 1887  2 October 1968) was a French, naturalized American painter, sculptor, chess player and writer whose work is associated with Cubism, conceptual art and Dada, although he was careful about his use of the term Dada and was not directly associated with Dada groups. Duchamp is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture. Duchamp has had an immense impact on twentieth-century and twenty first-century art. By World War I, he had rejected the work of many of his fellow artists (like Henri Matisse) as \\"retinal\\" art, intended only to please the eye. Instead, Duchamp wanted to put art back in the service of the mind.  - The Mona Lisa (or \\"La Gioconda\\" ) is a half-length portrait of Lisa Gherardini by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been described as \\"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world\\".  - Centre Georges Pompidou (commonly shortened to Centre Pompidou; also known as the Pompidou Centre in English) is a complex building in the Beaubourg area of the 4th arrondissement of Paris, near Les Halles, rue Montorgueil and the Marais. It was designed in the style of high-tech architecture by the architectural team of Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, along with Gianfranco Franchini.  - The Marcel Duchamp Prize (in French : \\"Prix Marcel Duchamp\\") is an annual award given to a young artist by the Association pour la Diffusion Internationale de l'Art Français (ADIAF). The winner receives €35,000 personally and up to €30,000 in order to produce an exhibition of their work in the Modern Art museum (Centre Georges Pompidou).   - The Alpine region of Switzerland, conventionally referred to as the Swiss Alps (, ), represents a major natural feature of the country and is, along with the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss portion of the Jura Mountains, one of its three main physiographic regions. The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps, encompassing an area sometimes called \\"Central Alps\\". While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland, the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein.  - Locarno (; Ticinese: ; formerly in ) is a southern Swiss town and municipality in the district Locarno (and its capital), located on the northern shore of Lago Maggiore at its northeastern tip in the canton of Ticino at the southern foot of the Swiss Alps. It has a population of about 16,000 (proper), and about 56,000 for the agglomeration of the same name including Ascona besides other municipalities.  - The Italian Renaissance was the earliest manifestation of the general European Renaissance, a period of great cultural change and achievement that began in Italy during the 14th century and lasted until the 16th century, marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe. The term Renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century, in the work of historians such as Jules Michelet and Jacob Burckhardt. Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century, many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century. The French word \\"renaissance\\" (\\"Rinascimento\\" in Italian) means \\"Rebirth\\", and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labeled the Dark Ages.  - Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 14522 May 1519), more commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian polymath whose areas of interest included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal.    What is the relationship between 'felice varini' and 'painter'? The answer is:","output":"The relationship between Felice Varini and the term 'painter' is that Felice Varini is an accomplished Swiss painter known for his unique geometric perspective-localized paintings. Varini's work focuses on creating geometric shapes, such as circles, squares, and lines in rooms and other spaces, primarily in urban and architectural environments, using projector-stencil techniques. As a painter, Varini's art style differs from traditional painting – instead of creating art to please the eye, his geometric creations are meant to challenge the viewer's perspective. The complete geometric shape of Varini's paintings can only be seen from a specific vantage point, while from other angles, the viewers would see fragmented shapes. This aspect of his work invites the audience to explore and engage with it, both visually and intellectually."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Given the below context:  The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida...  Guess a valid title for it!

Given a prompt and two responses, identify which response is the type of \\"yes, and\\". Indicate your answer by 'Response 1' if the first response is correct, otherwise 'Response 2'.  Note that a \\"Yes, and\\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange. Input: Prompt: You didn't notice that we are flying children?   Response 1: I noticed it but thought what was really distinctive about these kids is their enthusiasm.   Response 2: I'll tell you why you can't be a member of the board.

The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person that needed a quiet corner to rest his aching head?

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - shrink - explode - diminish - get smaller - stagnant A:","output":"Step 1: Analyzing the given question The given question talks about Sam's money and how it did not grow as he thought. We need to choose an option that best describes this situation. Step 2: Comparing the given options - shrink: This option implies a reduction in the size or amount, which seems plausible. - explode: This option usually means to increase or expand rapidly, but it can also mean to burst, which is not suitable for this context. - diminish: This option means to decrease or become less, which can also be a suitable answer. - get smaller: This is synonymous with shrink, so it is also a suitable answer. - stagnant: This option means to stay still or not move, which suggests that the money did not change, neither growing nor diminishing. Step 3: Choosing the most suitable option While four of the given options may imply a decrease in the money, \\"stagnant\\" best represents the situation where Sam's money did not grow as expected. The other options might suggest faster or more drastic shrinking, whereas stagnant implies the money simply not increasing in value or staying at the same level.
