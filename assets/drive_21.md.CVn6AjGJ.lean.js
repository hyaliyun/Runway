Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War, often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July 1871), was a conflict between the Second French Empire of Napoleon III and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded. Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked a French attack in order to draw the southern German statesBaden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadtinto an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded.  - An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine. Assault rifles were first used during World War II. Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept after World War II, by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing semi-automatic rifles, battle rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles. Examples include the StG 44, AK-47 and the M16 rifle.  - The French Army, officially the Land Army (to distinguish it from the Air Army) is the land-based and largest component of the French Armed Forces. Along with the French Air Force, the French Navy and the National Gendarmerie, it is responsible to the French government. The current Chief of Staff of the French Army (C.E.M.A.T.) is General Jean-Pierre Bosser, a direct subordinate of the Chief of the Defence Staff (C.E.M.A.). All soldiers are considered professionals following the suspension of conscription, voted in parliament in 1997 and made effective in 2001.  - The Fusil Gras Modèle 1874 M80 was a French service rifle of the 19th century . The Gras used by the French Army was an adaptation to metallic cartridge of the Chassepot breech - loading rifle by Colonel Basile Gras .  - The service rifle (also known as standard-issue rifle) of a given army or armed force is that which it issues as standard to its soldiers. In modern forces, this is typically a highly versatile and rugged assault rifle, battle rifle or carbine suitable for use in nearly all theatres and environments. Service rifles are also often selected for their upgradability (e.g., the addition of underslung grenade launchers, sights, flashlights, laser sights, etc.)  - The Chassepot, officially known as Fusil modèle 1866, was a bolt action military breechloading rifle, famous as the arm of the French forces in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/1871. It replaced an assortment of Minié muzzleloading rifles many of which were converted in 1867 to breech loading (the Tabatière rifles). A great improvement to existing military rifles in 1866, the Chassepot marked the commencement of the era of modern bolt action, breech-loading, military rifles. Beginning in 1874, the rifle was easily converted to fire metallic cartridges (under the name of Gras rifle), a step which would have been impossible to achieve with the Dreyse needle rifle.  - The French Navy (\\"national navy\\"), informally , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces. Tracing its roots back to 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Since the early foundings, its roles have been defined as maintaining intelligence, protecting populations, preventing crises, intervening wherever necessary to reestablish peace, and dissuading any threats against vital French interests. The Marine nationale consists of four branches: the \\"Force d'Action Navale\\", the \\"Forces Sous-marines\\", the \\"Aéronavale\\" and the \\"Fusiliers Marins\\" (including Commandos Marine). As a blue-water navy the Marine nationale operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships. The French Navy does not use prefixes of the names of its ships (such as the Royal Navy uses HMS, for instance). Foreign commentators sometimes use the prefixes \\"FS\\" (for \\"French Ship\\") or FNS (for \\"French Navy Ship\\"); these are not official, however.  - Conscription, or drafting, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 18 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.

Weiss began his career in the National Lacrosse League (NLL) in 2014 after being drafted 17th overall by the Vancouver Stealth in the 2013 NLL draft.  In his debut year, Weiss played for the Vancouver Stealth, making an immediate impact and showcasing his skills. However, his time with the Stealth was short-lived as he moved to the Buffalo Bandits in 2015 where he continues to play today.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"Alright, let me explain this like I'm talking to a five-year-old. So, this sentence tells us a few things about a place called Ardmore Airport in New Zealand: 1. The airport is 34 meters higher than the sea: Imagine you're standing at the beach and the water is gently touching your feet. If you could stack 34 one-meter-tall blocks on top of each other, that's how high the airport is compared to the sea. 2. The 3rd runway at the airport has a grass surface: Like the grass in your backyard or at the park, some runways have grass instead of hard materials like concrete. The word \\"poaceae\\" is a fancy name for grass. 3. The 3rd runway is 597.0 meters long: If you could lay out almost 600 one-meter-tall blocks in a straight line, that would show us how long this grass runway is. 4. The runway's name is 03L/21R: Runways have special names to help pilots know which ones to use. Just like how your name helps your friends know who you are, this name, 03L/21R, helps pilots with the same thing. So, we learned about the height of Ardmore Airport, the grass surface and length of its 3rd runway, and its special name. Isn't that cool?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They will use the litter box .;","output":"It appears that the cat is experiencing side effects from the antibiotics, specifically diarrhea or \\"the runs.\\" When a cat is on antibiotics, there can be a few potential outcomes. In this case, option (3) seems most relevant, as the text explicitly states that the cat is suffering from the runs due to the antibiotics. Nevertheless, let's explore all the available choices in detail: (1) They will go back to the vet for more: It is unclear if the cat owner will go back to the vet for more antibiotics. Since the cat is experiencing an adverse reaction to the medication, the owner might consult the vet for advice on whether to continue the treatment or seek an alternative solution. (2) None of the above choices: This option is vague and might not offer an appropriate response to the specific situation pertaining to the cat. Although it is possible that the other options are not accurate, there is a clear indication that the antibiotics have affected the cat, as mentioned in the text. (3) They will have the runs until they feel better: This option is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the text. Due to the antibiotics, the cat has developed diarrhea, which seems to be a temporary side effect. Once the cat's body has adjusted or finished the course of antibiotics, it is expected that the cat's condition will improve, and the runs will cease. The owner should keep a close eye on the cat's health and consult the veterinarian if the symptoms worsen or persist. (4) They will use the litter box: As the text specifically states that the cat cannot use the litter box when it has the runs, this option seems unlikely. The cat may have trouble controlling its bowel movements during this time, which can contribute to the inability to use the litter box. Once the cat's health improves and the runs subside, it is more likely that the cat will return to normal litter box habits. In conclusion, the most probable outcome is option (3), where the cat will have the runs until they feel better. While the other choices may contain elements of truth, they don't fully address the situation or the effects of the antibiotics on the cat. The cat owner should continue to monitor their pet's condition and consult the vet if needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: This may sound like an obvious step, but many people create their list of things to do before they die mentally. While there is nothing wrong with thinking about the things you want to do, writing them down is an important part of remembering, and finally actually achieving your goals.  Consider getting a small notebook that you can carry around with you. Then you can work on your list whenever you are.  Spend a little extra money and get a durable notebook, if you can afford to. This can help the list last over the long term. Writing a long list of things you want to do before your die can take a while. You do not need to try to finish it in one sitting. Add to your list over over months, maybe even years. It never has to be “finished.” Eventually you’ll build a very long list.  If you think of something new, take a moment to add it to the list. Your list will grow over time, and you will think of things to add even when you are not deliberately sitting down to add things.  This approach will help prevent you from getting frustrated. Maybe you're someone how spends twelve hours a day at work, but make sure you don't only think about work or business goals. Varying your goals across different areas of your life will help you develop a list that can improve all aspects of your life. A few examples might be these:   Relationships.  Finding your soulmate, having children, seeing your children grown and having children of their own is one train of thought.  Sporting achievements.  This may include shooting a 70 on a golf course with no handicap, or a hole in one, or it might mean catching a blue marlin, driving a stock car, or pitching a no-hitter.  One consideration on this category is being realistic about your ability, and present age.  Success in business or work.  Many people happily live full lives at a 9 to 5 job shuffling papers, owning a house in the suburbs, and taking the family to the local diner on Friday nights, but this may not be your idea of a goal in life.  Look at possibilities, list them, and find out what it will require to achieve them.  Philosophical goals. These are a little more difficult to describe, but they may include being a good neighbor, sharing your beliefs, or finding the meaning of life. Your list does not, and probably should not, reflect only material goals.  Making a difference.  Here, you can really challenge yourself, be it finding a great scientific discovery that ends suffering from a tragic disease, or establishing a foundation to help underprivileged children.  Artistic achievements.  There are a number of possible goals here, from writing a novel destined to become a classic, to painting a masterpiece.  Travels.  You may long to take a trip to Europe, Alaska, or the North Pole.  You may even want to travel to space, and even though you may never make it there, put it on the list, and see what opportunities arise to make the dream a reality. Do not limit yourself to these categories. They are just meant to give you some suggestions. Instead, let your imagination run wild. Be as creative as you can be. Keep a notepad handy, and use your imagination to list anything that comes to mind.  Be open ended, you do not need to know exactly how you will achieve every goal right now Just get them down on paper. If you limit yourself at this stage, you might miss out on things you genuinely wanted to try to accomplish. Don’t be afraid to keep items in some goals private. Do not limit yourself based on what you assume other people will think about your goals. Write them down now, and keep the list private if you want. You should think big, but also small. A mix of big and small goals will give you things that you can accomplish regularly. Not every goal has to be something for the far future.  Create small goals that can lead you to your bigger goals. For example, dance at home, then take a dance lesson, then go dancing in public. When your small goals lead to your bigger goals, you will lead yourself to long term success. Write something on your list that you can do today, tomorrow, and this week. If you include items you can accomplish in the short term, you will feel like you have created a list you can actually accomplish. Add to it, or take things away. After all, it is just a personal list. It is yours to expand, change, or reduce.  Keep this original list and continue to work with it. The list itself is important, because it serves as a reminder of all the things you want to do. Be willing to change your list, but also think carefully before making changes. If you take adding and subtracting from the list seriously, you are more likely to take the items on the list seriously. Summary:","output":"This article says that making a list of things you want to do before you die is a good idea. You should write down your goals and dreams because it helps you remember them and makes it easier to achieve them. You can use a small notebook and write your list over time, so it keeps growing as you think of new things. Your list should have different types of goals, like relationships, sports, work, helping others, art, and travel.

Write a title for this article: As a murder and corruption scandal enveloping a former member of China’s elite leadership continued to snowball, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao issued a new call on Monday for the government to end a culture of graft lest it lead to the end of Communist rule. In an article in the conservative Communist Party journal Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, Mr. Wen said the government must hold officials more strongly accountable for corruption that occurs on their watch and make the results of corruption investigations open to public inspection. The article, titled, “Let power be exercised in the sunshine,” is the latest in a string of anticorruption broadsides aired since the former Politburo member Bo Xilai was ensnared in February in a murder investigation involving his wife. Mr. Bo was removed from the Politburo after party officials issued a report accusing him of “serious disciplinary violations” and accusing his wife, Gu Kailai, of arranging the killing of Neil Heywood, a British businessman and onetime friend of the Bo family, after a financial dispute. China’s official news media have maintained a high-level drumbeat of warnings against corruption since the scandal became public, including a speech by President Hu Jintao that urged the military to rid itself of graft, and a prominent commentary last week on Xinhua, the state-run news service, that bemoaned efforts by the spouses and children of high officials to seek personal gain through official power. “We must have a profound understanding of this: That the biggest danger to a political party in power is corruption,” the article said. “If it is not handled properly, the nature of the regime may change, and its rule may end. It is an extremely difficult and important challenge we are facing right now.” Mr. Wen’s article cast the investigation of Mr. Bo and his wife as proof of the party’s determination to weed out graft no matter where it is found. “China is a socialist country ruled by law, and the dignity and authority of the law cannot be trampled,” Mr. Wen said in the article. “There is no special citizen before the law. It does not allow any special party members to override the law within the party.” Communist Party officials regularly issue anticorruption attacks and frequently make public reports listing the number of bureaucrats who have been prosecuted or the amount of money recovered from graft investigations. Mr. Wen’s article was somewhat different because it placed new emphasis on fighting graft by making the results of the investigations public, and because of its unusually harsh tone, said Zhang Xiaojin, who heads the political science department at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Mr. Wen’s toughness “is no exaggeration,” he said. “We can see that the problem is actually getting worse every year.” Â Li Bibo contributed research.","output":"\\"Sunshine on Corruption: China's Struggle to Preserve Communist Rule Amidst Graft Scandals\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Coming off their road win over the Lions, the Giants went home for a Week 12 intraconference duel with the Minnesota Vikings. In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Vikings QB Tarvaris Jackson completed a 60-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. The Giants responded with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run. Minnesota retook the lead with safety Darren Sharper returning an interception 20 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, Vikings' RB Chester Taylor got an 8-yard TD run, along with kicker Ryan Longwell making a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Giants' kicker Lawrence Tynes made a 48-yard field goal, and Minnesota's Longwell made a 26-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Vikings' safety Dwight Smith returned an interception 93 yards for a touchdown, along with LB Chad Greenway returning an interception 37 yards for a touchdown.  New York's QB Eli Manning completed a 6-yard TD pass to WR Plaxico Burress to complete the scoring. Eli Manning was intercepted four times (with three of his interceptions being returned for touchdowns).  He became the third NFL QB since 1970 to have three interceptions get returned for touchdowns.

Has the mannequin challenge come to a standstill? Was it fitting that late 2016 saw us all standing stock still, as if we were trying to convince a suspicious bear we were already dead? Phone cameras prowled around increasingly elaborate and celebrity-bedecked tableaux vivants, looking for signs of life, yet no one stirred as the views racked up. In that sense, this was the additive inverse of 2013’s Harlem Shake. It was an ice bucket challenge where no one needed nominating. A Cheerios challenge where you didn’t have to put cereal on a sleeping baby’s forehead. Or, if you prefer, a running-man challenge that wasn’t quite so tedious. It feels mesolithic in internet years, but the original mannequin challenge is preserved as well as any Florentine sculpture, on Twitter, dated 26 October by a user called @pvrity___ (Jasmine Cavins). In it, a group of teens at Edward H White high school, in Jacksonville, Florida, remain completely still in class in mildly interesting poses. For all their inertia, things rapidly picked up steam. Five thousand retweets later, by 7 November, Hillary Clinton was doing it on her jet, accompanied by Bill and Jon Bon Jovi. That’s right – within two weeks, even your mum had heard of it. Somewhere, the song Black Beetle by rap duo Rae Sremmurd became a modern version of Baauer’s Harlem Shake and, from early ensemble performances involving hundreds of high-schoolers, it spiralled out to sports teams, then the celebrity world, via a postmodern version performed by Rae Sremmurd themselves.

Problem:PURPOSE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with poor outcomes. Despite increased evidence shows that dysregulation of histone modification contributes to AML, specific drugs targeting key histone modulators are not applied in the clinical treatment of AML. Here, we investigated whether targeting KDM6B, the demethylase of tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), has a therapeutic potential for AML.     METHODS A KDM6B-specific inhibitor, GSK-J4, was applied to treat the primary cells from AML patients and AML cell lines in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing was performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of inhibiting KDM6B for the treatment of AML.     RESULTS Here we observed that the mRNA expression of KDM6B was up-regulated in AML and positively correlated with poor survival. Treatment with GSK-J4 increased the global level of H3K27me3 and reduced the proliferation and colony-forming ability of primary AML cells and AML cell lines. GSK-J4 treatment significantly induced cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in Kasumi-1 cells, and displayed a synergistic effect with cytosine arabinoside. Notably, injection of GSK-J4 attenuated the disease progression in a human AML xenograft mouse model in vivo. Treatment with GSK-J4 predominantly resulted in down-regulation of DNA replication and cell-cycle-related pathways, as well as abrogated the expression of critical cancer-promoting HOX genes. ChIP-qPCR validated an increased enrichment of H3K27me3 in the transcription start sites of these HOX genes.     CONCLUSIONS In summary, our findings suggest that targeting KDM6B with GSK-J4 has a therapeutic potential for the treatment of AML.

Going about his day, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews). After the audition, Labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. That night, Richard comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome and Toddy incites a brawl by insulting Richard and the women in his group. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria dining at a restaurant, and she invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc. The duo run out through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she ambushes Richard and literally kicks him out. Witnessing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man (the illusion convinced Richard who stumbles downstairs to his friends waiting in the car claiming a strange man wearing his clothes hit him) and presenting her to Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.

Q: Question: what is the function of the hard palate? Would \\"Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"Yes, that would be a reasonable answer. To provide further context and a step-by-step explanation: 1. The primary function of the hard palate is to separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. This allows for simultaneous breathing and eating without the risk of food entering the nasal passages. 2. The hard palate also plays a crucial role in the process of chewing and swallowing. It provides a stable surface against which the tongue can compress food during mastication. 3. The Rugae, which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane covering the hard palate, contribute to this process. They help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx by providing additional traction and contact points for the tongue to manipulate the food. 4. Furthermore, the hard palate is involved in speech production, particularly in the formation of certain consonant sounds that require the tongue to make contact with the roof of the mouth. In summary, the function of the hard palate is to separate the nasal and oral cavities, facilitate chewing and swallowing, and play a role in speech production. The statement \\"Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx\\" accurately describes one of the functions of the hard palate and its anatomical features."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the line of scrimmage, behind the defensive linemen, and therefore \\"back up the line.\\" Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a \\"two point stance\\" (as opposed to the defensive linemen, who put one or two hands on the ground for a \\"three point stance\\" or \\"four point stance\\" before the ball is snapped).   - In American and Canadian football, a line of scrimmage is an imaginary transverse line (across the width of the football field) beyond which a team cannot cross until the next play has begun. Its location is based on the spot where the ball is placed after the end of the most recent play and following the assessment of any penalty yards.  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - Ronald McKinnon ( born September 20 , 1973 ) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League .

Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.  - A touchdown is a means of scoring in both American and Canadian football.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick from:  a). no.  b). yes.","output":"While there is no absolute answer to whether the US elections will be rigged, one can analyze it from different perspectives to gain a better understanding of the potential for rigging and the likelihood of it occurring. Whether or not the winners are planned in advance is a separate question that requires a distinct analysis. Therefore, I would choose answer option a). No, these questions are not the same. Concerning the potential rigging of an election, the United States has several measures in place to ensure the legitimacy of their electoral processes, which involve multiple audits, verifications, and safeguards. Election authorities at the federal, state, and local levels work diligently to maintain fair and transparent elections. For example, most voting systems used in the US produce a paper record or a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) to ensure that the results can be double-checked independently in case of disputes or suspected fraud. Additionally, numerous polls are run by independent organizations, providing an indirect yet considerable check on the electoral process. However, no system is entirely foolproof, and the potential for fraud or manipulation does exist. Misdeeds can arise from various possibilities, such as voter suppression, gerrymandering, or even outright hacking of the electronic voting systems. Nonetheless, most of these fraudulent activities would require coordination on a massive scale, making it extremely difficult to accomplish successfully, especially without detection. The idea of pre-determined winners relates to the concept of conspiracy theories, in which powerful and unknown entities manipulate the election process to ensure a particular candidate's victory. While election fraud has occurred in the past, claiming that the winners are planned in advance would need substantial and credible evidence to support such an assertion. Moreover, the democratic nature of the US political system, along with its tight checks and balances, makes it highly unlikely that any shadowy organization would be capable of deciding the winners without being exposed eventually. In conclusion, while the risk of election rigging and predetermined winners cannot be deemed entirely non-existent, the numerous safeguards and transparent processes in place at multiple levels of the US electoral system mitigate these risks significantly. The questions mentioned above are different in nature, as one addresses the potential for electoral manipulation, while the other delves into the realm of conspiracy theories."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

It is a phenomenon characterized primarily by members of most arachnid orders, as well as several insect orders. The adaptive foraging hypothesis, aggressive spillover hypothesis and mistaken identity hypothesis are among the proposed theories to explain how sexual cannibalism evolved. This behavior is believed to have evolved as a manifestation of sexual conflict, occurring when the reproductive interests of males and females differ. In many species that exhibit sexual cannibalism, the female consumes the male upon detection. Females of cannibalistic species are generally hostile and unwilling to mate; thus many males of these species have developed adaptive behaviors to counteract female aggression.  - The Western United States, commonly referred to as the American West, the Far West, or simply the West, traditionally refers to the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States.

Write a summary based on this article: Carbohydrates, long blamed for fuelling obesity, have now been linked to lung cancer.      A new study has revealed a 49 per cent increase in risk among people consuming a diet with a high glycemic index.      The index measures how quickly blood sugar levels are raised after a meal, and foods with a high GI include white bread or bagels, corn flakes and puffed rice.      However, diets high in fruits and vegetables were found to decrease the risk.      Lead study author Dr Stephanie Melkonian, of University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, said: \\"We observed a 49 per cent increased risk of lung cancer among subjects with the highest daily GI compared to those with the lowest daily GI.      • Breath test that tells you if you have lung cancer      \\"Diets high in glycemic index result in higher levels of blood glucose and insulin, which promote perturbations in the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs).      \\"Previous research suggests increased levels of IGFs are associated with increased lung cancer risk.      \\"However, the association between glycemic index and lung cancer risk was unclear.\\"      In the UK, there are around 45,525 new cases of the disease diagnosed each year, while 35,371 people lose their life to the disease annually, according to Cancer Research UK.

Five cancer red flags to never ignore      The study, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, is the largest ever to investigate the potential link between glycemic index and lung cancer.      Scientists surveyed 1,905 patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer and compared the results with 2,413 healthy individuals.      Senior study author Dr Xifeng Wu said: \\"The associations were more pronounced among subjects who were never smokers, diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma or had less than 12 years of education.      \\"This suggests that it is the average quality, instead of quantity, of carbohydrates consumed that may modulate lung cancer risk.\\"      Photo: Alamy      Dr Wu added: \\"The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol consumption and being physically active, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer.\\"      • Lung cancer victims lack sympathy ||||| Scientists from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have found that people who eat a diet full of high glycemic index foods—think processed white bread, bagels, white rice, baguettes—had a 49% higher risk of developing lung cancer, even if they’ve never smoked a single cigarette.      The study, which was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention this week, is the largest ever to investigate the potential links between glycemic index and lung cancer, according to the authors. A glycemic index is a measurement of how rapidly carbohydrates elevate blood sugar levels in the body. The higher the glycemic index, the more rapidly blood sugar levels rise after a meal which results in elevated levels of blood glucose and insulin. That in turns raises what’s called insulin-like growth factors, which are linked to an increased lung cancer risk, according to the scientists.      Scientists at MD Anderson surveyed 1,905 patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer and another 2,413 healthy individuals, all non-Hispanic whites. Those subjects reported their past dietary habits and health histories, and they were then divided into groups based on their associated glycemic index and glycemic load, a measure of carbohydrate quantity.      “We observed a 49% increased risk of lung cancer among subjects with the highest daily glycemic index compared to those with the lowest daily glycemic index,” said Xifeng Wu, professor of epidemiology and senior author of the study. “The associates were more pronounced among subjects who were never smokers.”      Interestingly, there was no link between the glycemic load—i.e. the quantity of carbohydrates consumed—and lung cancer, which suggests that it’s the quality, not the amount of carbohydrates, that has the biggest effect on lung cancer risk, said Wu.      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer among both men and women in the U.S. It’s also the leading cause of cancer mortality, with over 150,000 deaths from lung cancer expected in the U.S. this year alone, according to the American Cancer Society. Smoking and tobacco use is still the leading cause, though it doesn’t account for all cases. Researchers had long suspected a link between a high-glycemic index diet and lung cancer risk, but the link between the two was unclear until now.      Among non-smokers in the study, those within the highest glycemic index group were more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer as those in the lowest group. For smokers, the difference was elevated by 31% between the two groups.      “The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, such as avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol consumption, and being physically active, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer,” said Wu.      Low glycemic index foods include things like 100% stone-ground whole wheat bread, rolled or steel-cut oatmeal, most fruits, and non-starchy vegetables. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE      People who eat a sugary, starchy diet may be raising their risk of lung cancer, even if they don’t smoke, researchers say.      They found that people who recall eating more foods that have a high glycemic index also were more likely to develop lung cancer. Glycemic index is a term that’s familiar to people with diabetes. It describes food that raises blood sugar and stimulates production of insulin — think bagels, white rice and some fruits such as melon and pineapple.      It’s not the first study to link glycemic index with cancer risk, but it’s rare to link it with lung cancer. That may be mostly because lung cancer is so overwhelmingly caused by smoking.      The team at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston studied 1,905 people who had just been diagnosed with lung cancer and compared them to 2,415 people without cancer. They quizzed them about their eating habits, smoking, income and other factors.      \\"Reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer.\\"      People who ate the most foods with a high glycemic index were about 50 percent more likely to be in the lung cancer group than people who reported they ate the fewest high-glycemic foods, the team reported in the journal Cancer Epidemiology and Biomarkers.      The link was stronger among people who never smoked; non-smokers were more than twice as likely to have lung cancer if they reported eating a high-glycemic diet.      “The results from this study suggest that, besides maintaining healthy lifestyles, reducing the consumption of foods and beverages with high glycemic index may serve as a means to lower the risk of lung cancer,” said Dr. Xifeng Wu, who led the study.      Related: Here's how sugar might fuel the growth of cancer      How can this happen? Doctors aren’t sure, but there’s a theory that high-glycemic foods stimulate the body to make insulin, which in turn affects the growth of cells via compounds called insulin-like growth factors or IGF. Cancer is the uncontrolled proliferation of cells, so it might be that the high-glycemic foods are fueling the growth of tiny tumors.      “IGFs have been shown to play a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in cancer and there is evidence to suggest that IGFs are elevated in lung cancer patients,” Wu’s team wrote.      It’s a suspect in several types of cancer.      “Previous studies have investigated the association between glycemic index, and the related measure glycemic load, and a variety of cancers including colorectal, stomach, pancreas, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, and thyroid but these studies are limited and results have been largely inconclusive,” the researchers wrote.      This study is not conclusive, either. For one thing, the researchers asked their volunteers to remember what they ate. For another, it’s an association. People who eat high-glycemic foods may also do something else that also raises their risk of cancer. And this particular study focused only on non-Hispanic white people.      Marji McCullough, an expert in nutritional epidemiology at the American Cancer Society, says it will be important to look at people who don't have cancer now and watch what they eat for years or decades, and see who develops cancer.      Related: Cancer experts are mad about the dietary guidelines      Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer in the U.S., killing more than 150,000 people a year. It causes only vague symptoms at first, so when most people are diagnosed, the cancer has already spread and is then far more likely to be fatal.      Experts know diet and lifestyle can affect cancer. Obesity, lack of exercise, eating red meat and lots of high-fat dairy foods, and eating too few fruits and vegetables can all raise a person’s odds of developing cancer.      This study adds to a growing body of evidence that people can lower their cancer risk not only by staying away from tobacco and exercising more, but by choosing a healthier diet.      \\"Aside from not smoking, it’s important to follow cancer prevention guidelines that maintain healthy body weight, physical activity, and eating an overall healthy diet rich in vegetables and plant food and lower red and processed meat. Choose foods that help maintain healthy body weight,\\" McCullough said.      According to the American Diabetes Association, low-glycemic foods include:      100 percent stone-ground whole wheat or pumpernickel bread      Oatmeal (rolled or steel-cut), oat bran, muesli      Pasta, converted rice, barley, bulgar      Sweet potato, corn, yam, lima/butter beans, peas, legumes and lentils      Most fruits, non-starchy vegetables and carrots      Medium glycemic index foods include:      Whole wheat, rye and pita bread      Quick oats      Brown, wild or basmati rice, couscous      High glycemic index foods include: ||||| Abstract      Background: Postprandial glucose (PPG) and insulin responses play a role in carcinogenesis. We evaluated the association between dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL), markers of carbohydrate intake and PPG, and lung cancer risk in non-Hispanic whites.      Methods: GL and GI were assessed among 1,905 newly diagnosed lung cancer cases recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) and 2,413 healthy controls recruited at Kelsey-Seybold Clinics (Houston, TX). We assessed associations between quintiles of GI/GL and lung cancer risk and effect modification by various risk factors. ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.      Results: We observed a significant association between GI [5th vs. 1st quintile (Q) OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.21–1.83; P trend <0.001] and lung cancer risk and GI ac (5th vs. 1st Q OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.20–1.81; P trend = 0.001) and lung cancer risk. We observed a more pronounced association between GI and lung cancer risk among never smokers (5th vs. 1st Q OR = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.42–3.57), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC; 5th vs. 1st Q OR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.30–2.83), and those with less than 12 years of education (5th vs. 1st Q OR = 1.75; 95% CI, 1.19–2.58, P interaction = 0.02).      Conclusion: This study suggests that dietary GI and other lung cancer risk factors may jointly and independently influence lung cancer etiology.      Impact: Understanding the role of GI in lung cancer could inform prevention strategies and elucidate biologic pathways related to lung cancer risk.

Van Winkle has never known his biological father; he was given the family name of the Dutch man his mother was married to at the time of his birth. When Van Winkle was four, his mother divorced. Afterward, he grew up moving between Dallas and Miami, where his new stepfather worked at a car dealership. After almost non-stop touring for the previous three years, Ice took a break from music in 1993 and began competing in jet skiing (becoming the 6th best jet ski racer in the world and obtaining sponsorship from Kawasaki) as well as resuming Motocross racing.  By 1994, Ice received less publicity and became removed from the public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album \\"more clunky than funky\\". Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song \\"Get Loose\\" as \\"snappy\\", writing that although the lyrics are \\"inane\\", \\"the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ... In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics.\\" Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that \\"There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.\\" Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: \\"That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people.\\" When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said \\"A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time\\". Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt.  At around this time, Ice began using ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. During periods of heavy drug use, Ice received many tattoos from artist acquaintances. According to Ice, he \\"was in [his] binge days. [He] didn't even realize how many [he] was getting\\". Ice attempted suicide with a heroin overdose on July 4, 1994 but was revived by his friends. After being revived, Ice decided that it was time to change his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach. After expanding his Mind Blowin tour overseas in 1995, Ice sold his estate in California and took a break from music, rather focusing on motocrossing and jet skiing in Florida. By the summer Ice was the world's No. 6-ranked sit-down Jet Ski racer, competing nearly every weekend and earning a Kawasaki sponsorship.  Uncertain about his future career, Ice studied real estate and started working on the side renovating and selling houses. In late 1995, Ice set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a grunge band, Pickin Scabz. The name was set to reflect Ice's career and how he was healing from his suicide attempt and that he was now \\"picking up the pieces\\". Ice expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound he was looking for. In 1996, longtime associate and friend Monte Lipman signed Ice as an artist for Universal Republic Records. He did guest vocals with no stage name for the song \\"Boom\\" by Bloodhound Gang on their CD One Fierce Beer Coaster.

Is \\"The hypnotic electronic dance song \\"On and On\\", produced in 1984 by Chicago DJ Jesse Saunders and co-written by Vince Lawrence, had elements that became staples of the early house sound, such as the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer and minimal vocals as well as a Roland (specifically TR-808) drum machine and Korg (specifically Poly-61) synthesizer.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, the statement provided is correct. \\"On and On\\" is indeed a hypnotic electronic dance song produced in 1984 by Chicago-based DJ Jesse Saunders. Saunders, along with co-writer Vince Lawrence, pioneered the early house sound through the incorporation of a range of innovative musical elements. One of the key features of \\"On and On\\" was the use of the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. This instrument, released in 1981, was initially designed to accompany guitarists during practice sessions, but it soon found popularity among electronic musicians for its unique, squelchy \\"acid\\" bass sound. This particular sound would go on to become a defining characteristic of the acid house subgenre, which emerged in the late 1980s. The Roland TR-808 drum machine, another staple of the early house sound, was also used in the song's production. As one of the most influential drum machines ever made, the TR-808 offered a wealth of highly customizable rhythm and percussion options. Its distinctive sounds – particularly its booming, synthesized kick drum – played an integral role in shaping not only house music but also various other electronic and hip-hop genres. Additionally, the Korg Poly-61 synthesizer was employed in the making of \\"On and On.\\" Released in late 1982, the Poly-61 was Korg's first digitally controlled analog synthesizer and enabled musicians to produce complex, layered sounds. Its combination of digital programming and warm analog tones made it a popular choice for artists across genres, further solidifying its place in electronic music history. Lastly, \\"On and On\\" featured minimal, repetitive vocals, which became another hallmark of the early house sound. This stripped-back approach to songwriting allowed for an emphasis on the track's rhythm and groove, ultimately laying the groundwork for countless other producers to follow. In conclusion, Jesse Saunders and Vince Lawrence's 1984 song \\"On and On\\" is a groundbreaking example of early house music. It captures the era's pioneering spirit, showcasing a unique synthesis of innovative sonic components, such as the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, Roland TR-808 drum machine, and Korg Poly-61 synthesizer, in addition to minimal vocals, which went on to define the genre for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  After reading the above, is \\"Quds mosque\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What group did Atta join that failed at trying to bring together two religions?\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, \\"Quds mosque\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"What group did Atta join that failed at trying to bring together two religions?\\" Atta joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg in the fall of 1997, which aimed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. However, his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality made him a poor bridge, and the group's attempt to bring together the two religions failed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On a rocky outcrop ringed by the flaming red and orange vines and red-brick living quarters for teachers, Kanhaiya Kumar, India's most loved and loathed student, looks remarkably composed. It's been barely a month since the 28-year-old Phd student of African studies was picked up by the police and charged with sedition for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans at a meeting on the campus. (Two other students remain in custody.)  It's barely a week since Mr Kumar, who's the president of the students' union and is affiliated to Communist Party of India, was freed on bail, and gave a stirring speech on the campus that went viral. Mr Kumar, according to political scientist Suhas Palshikar, is the latest student to be associated with the \\"simmering unrest\\" on Indian campuses, a \\"result of the BJP's newfound ideological aggression and political arrogance\\". Many are calling him a student icon. Over the last month, Mr Kumar has inspired a hefty Wikipedia entry, stirring paeans to a rising leader (Red Star over India, exulted The Telegraph), even listicles. His friends reckon he has already given 50 media interviews in five days. A little-know fringe group leader with a paltry bank balance announced a hefty bounty on his head, his  Facebook account has been hacked, his mobile phone seized by the police. Some people have even begun raising money in his name. Mr Kumar's many admirers believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi has \\"met his match\\" in the feisty student. His critics have called him an anarchist, a misguided idealist, a sloganeering \\"Johnny-come-lately who is upstaging stalwarts\\", and given him gratuitous advice on how he should stop politicking and begin earning for his poor parents. \\"I get up in the morning, do some work for the union, and then do interviews all day. They say after TV channels and newspapers, the magazines will come,\\" he says. Mr Kumar appears to be basking in the warm glow of his meteoric media rise. When he's not handling the scrum, there's time for some light banter with friends. When a friend teases him about being an attention seeker, he quips, \\"Only (Prime Minister Modi) suffers from an attention seeker's syndrome.\\" Some hearty laughter follows. He's carrying some handwritten papers of Brecht's poetry, translated in Hindi - \\"The book is out of print, so we are sharing these handwritten poems.\\" Many believe that in a nation desperate for heroes and soaked in a febrile media culture adept at myth making and instant vilification, Mr Kumar has been thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight by a fumbling and offensive government and a clutch of hostile news channels. So does he feel like an accidental hero? \\"I am no hero,\\" says Mr Kumar. \\"Thank the people who made me a hero, including a section of the media who work for a particular party. The real heroes and heroines are those who are fighting for democracy against an authoritarian regime.\\" He does not suffer from any false modesty. He hasn't become famous overnight, he says. It has been a \\"gradual process\\" since he first arrived at JNU from his village in Begusarai in Bihar. (His father, a small farmer, cannot work any longer as he is paralysed after a stroke and his mother is a government childcare centre worker.) \\"I had a culture shock when I arrived in JNU. There are students from 145 countries here. My horizons have grown. Last year, I was voted as the leader of the students' union,\\" he says. Students say his rousing performance in November's presidential debate - a town-hall discussion, a day before the union election - made him a name on the campus. A Kumar speech, delivered in fluent Hindi, is usually an animated performance of oratory, rhetoric, wit and gladiatorial mojo. \\"The number of Facebook friends jumped from 2,000 to 5,000. A thousand people followed me. There is now pressure from people when you are not updating your status. Four hundred people like your status now, up from 20 before,\\" he says. \\"Things have obviously moved fast [since my arrest]. When my Facebook account is hacked, people raise money in my name and I am targeted to run down my university, I feel a bit uneasy.\\" Mr Kumar says his critics - mostly irate, older urbanites -  who describe him as an amateur in politics forget that he was initiated very early when he was studying at a college in Patna. \\"I was part of a group in college which spoke out about why classes were not being held, why women were harassed, why sons of politicians were misbehaving on the campus.\\" \\"So you have to understand that my politics is rooted in my lived experiences. It didn't happen overnight.\\" I ask him about his politics. Some of it is an inspired mix of liberalism and boilerplate leftism: the battle in India is \\"between pro-democracy versus anti-democracy, pro-people versus pro-corporate\\". Other times, it is more nuanced: India's left parties need \\"to get rid of their purity\\", secular parties should unite against the scourge of religious politics, the \\"progressive forces\\" have regrettably ceded space to the right-wing, parties should leave their student wings alone to help them grow freely. Despite the events of the last month, Mr Kumar looks unusually calm. He is not easy to provoke. It is difficult to figure out whether he's being cheeky or earnest when he names Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal, two Bollywood actors, who openly back Mr Modi's BJP aggressively, as his favourites. So there is also a life beyond beyond politics. Days before he was put behind bars for shouting slogans - reports say some of the videos of his speech telecast by some channels were doctored - he discovered Leonardo DiCaprio. \\"I am brushing up my English, so we went to watch The Revenant. I loved it, mainly because of Leo. My friends were telling me that he should have won the Oscar much earlier. I had no idea about his previous work. \\"When I was in jail I heard that he had won the Oscar. I felt very happy.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"This article is about Kanhaiya Kumar, a student from India who has become both loved and loathed.

Analyze the two sentences and identify the key elements: Sentence 1: Until the early twentieth century, Marans was famous for the \\"local bean of Marans\\" and its fairs in honor of these especially red beans. Key elements: early twentieth century, Marans, famous, local bean of Marans, fairs, honor, especially red beans. Sentence 2: Until the early twentieth century, Marans was famous for the \\"red bean of Marans\\" and its fairs in honor of these particularly local beans. Key elements: early twentieth century, Marans, famous, red bean of Marans, fairs, honor, particularly local beans. 2. Compare the key elements in the sentences: The common elements are: early twentieth century, Marans, famous, fairs, honor.  The differences lie in the characterization of the beans: - Sentence 1: local bean of Marans, especially red beans. - Sentence 2: red bean of Marans, particularly local beans. 3. Determine if these differences change the overall meaning: In Sentence 1, the focus is more on the beans being local to Marans, and the beans are notably red. In Sentence 2, the emphasis is on the red color of the beans, and these beans are especially local.  Although the specific emphasis on the beans' characteristics is slightly switched, the overall meaning of the two sentences is similar:  - Marans was famous for a specific type of bean (local, red) until the early twentieth century. - There were fairs in Marans to celebrate these beans. However, the switch in emphasis could lead to a nuanced difference in meaning: - Sentence 1 emphasizes more on the locality of the beans, with color being a secondary characteristic. - Sentence 2 emphasizes more on the color of the beans, with the locality being a secondary characteristic. In conclusion, while both sentences convey a similar overall meaning, there is a nuanced difference in the emphasis on the characteristics of the beans."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The Social Security Administration announced Monday that it will immediately cease efforts to collect on taxpayers’ debts to the government that are more than 10 years old.      The action comes after The Washington Post reported that the government was seizing state and federal tax refunds that were on their way to about 400,000 Americans who had relatives who owed money to the Social Security agency. In many cases, the people whose refunds were intercepted had never heard of any debt, and the debts dated as far back as the middle of the past century.      “I have directed an immediate halt to further referrals under the Treasury Offset Program to recover debts owed to the agency that are 10 years old and older pending a thorough review of our responsibility and discretion under the current law,” the acting Social Security commissioner, Carolyn Colvin, said in a statement.      Colvin said anyone who has received Social Security or Supplemental Security Income benefits and “believes they have been incorrectly assessed with an overpayment” should contact the agency and “seek options to resolve the overpayment.”      The effort to collect on old debts began with a single line in the 2008 farm bill that lifted the statute of limitations on debts to the government that are more than 10 years old. The Treasury Department then set up rules that allowed the government to settle such debts by intercepting taxpayers’ refunds. The department has collected about 2 billion in intercepted tax refunds this year, 75 million of that on debts delinquent for more than 10 years.      If you're one of the millions of Americans using your tax refund like a “forced savings account,” here's why you shouldn’t — with marshmallow Peeps to help explain. Michelle Singletary contributed to this video. (Kate M. Tobey and Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)      Mary Grice, a federal worker who lives in Takoma Park, Md., never got the refunds she was expecting to see in her mailbox this year. The government seized her checks because of a 2,996 debt that was supposedly incurred under her father’s Social Security number. Her father died in 1960, when she was 4, and her mother received survivors’ benefits thereafter.      But 37 years passed between when the Social Security agency says it overpaid someone in the Grice family and when Mary Grice’s refund was taken. She was unable to find out from the agency exactly who received the overpayment — her mother or perhaps her father’s first wife, both of whom are no longer living.      The suspension of the collection effort is “the right thing to do,” said Grice’s attorney, Robert Vogel. “It’s a first step. The next thing they have to do is stop collecting debts from children under any circumstances.”      Vogel filed suit in federal court in Greenbelt, Md., last week, alleging that the government denied Grice due process by failing to give her notice of the debt and by taking the money from her, even though she was not receiving government benefits at the time the debt was incurred.      Vogel and several members of Congress argued that the government should not be holding children accountable for the financial acts of their parents. The Federal Trade Commission, on its Web site, advises Americans that “family members typically are not obligated to pay the debts of a deceased relative from their own assets.”      After The Post’s article was published late last week, many hundreds of taxpayers whose refunds had been intercepted came forward and complained to members of Congress that they had been given no notice of the debts and that the government had not explained why they were being held responsible for debts that their deceased parents may have incurred.      In a note Social Security officials sent to several members of Congress on Monday, the agency said, “We will be reexamining our responsibilities under current law for such referrals and will be notifying you of our conclusions upon completion of the thorough review.”      In a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said that government agencies were apparently “not properly notifying individuals or allowing them to inspect records of the debt they supposedly owe, which are violations of the law.”      Grassley said that although Congress did authorize the government to seek payment on old debts, the law “says nothing about allowing the government to offset payments from an individual to pay debts not in his or her name. It is unclear where the government has that authority.”      The senator said that Congress created a rigorous system to ensure that debt collection is handled transparently but that “it appears that agencies are abusing this system.” ||||| A few weeks ago, with no notice, the U.S. government intercepted Mary Grice’s tax refunds from both the IRS and the state of Maryland. Grice had no idea that Uncle Sam had seized her money until some days later, when she got a letter saying that her refund had gone to satisfy an old debt to the government — a very old debt.      When Grice was 4, back in 1960, her father died, leaving her mother with five children to raise. Until the kids turned 18, Sadie Grice got survivor benefits from Social Security to help feed and clothe them.      Now, Social Security claims it overpaid someone in the Grice family — it’s not sure who — in 1977. After 37 years of silence, four years after Sadie Grice died, the government is coming after her daughter. Why the feds chose to take Mary’s money, rather than her surviving siblings’, is a mystery.      Across the nation, hundreds of thousands of taxpayers who are expecting refunds this month are instead getting letters like the one Grice got, informing them that because of a debt they never knew about — often a debt incurred by their parents — the government has confiscated their check.      The Treasury Department has intercepted 1.9 billion in tax refunds already this year — 75 million of that on debts delinquent for more than 10 years, said Jeffrey Schramek, assistant commissioner of the department’s debt management service. The aggressive effort to collect old debts started three years ago — the result of a single sentence tucked into the farm bill lifting the 10-year statute of limitations on old debts to Uncle Sam.      If you're one of the millions of Americans using your tax refund like a \\"forced savings account,\\" here's why you shouldn't—with marshmallow Peeps to help explain. Michelle Singletary contributed to this video. (Kate M. Tobey and Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)      No one seems eager to take credit for reopening all these long-closed cases. A Social Security spokeswoman says the agency didn’t seek the change; ask Treasury. Treasury says it wasn’t us; try Congress. Congressional staffers say the request probably came from the bureaucracy.      The only explanation the government provides for suddenly going after decades-old debts comes from Social Security spokeswoman Dorothy Clark: “We have an obligation to current and future Social Security beneficiaries to attempt to recoup money that people received when it was not due.”      Since the drive to collect on very old debts began in 2011, the Treasury Department has collected 424 million in debts that were more than 10 years old. Those debts were owed to many federal agencies, but the one that has many Americans howling this tax season is the Social Security Administration, which has found 400,000 taxpayers who collectively owe 714 million on debts more than 10 years old. The agency expects to have begun proceedings against all of those people by this summer.      “It was a shock,” said Grice, 58. “What incenses me is the way they went about this. They gave me no notice, they can’t prove that I received any overpayment, and they use intimidation tactics, threatening to report this to the credit bureaus.”      Grice filed suit against the Social Security Administration in federal court in Greenbelt this week, alleging that the government violated her right to due process by holding her responsible for a 2,996 debt supposedly incurred under her father’s Social Security number.      Social Security officials told Grice that six people — Grice, her four siblings and her father’s first wife, whom she never knew — had received benefits under her father’s account. The government doesn’t look into exactly who got the overpayment; the policy is to seek compensation from the oldest sibling and work down through the family until the debt is paid.      The Federal Trade Commission, on its Web site, advises Americans that “family members typically are not obligated to pay the debts of a deceased relative from their own assets.” But Social Security officials say that if children indirectly received assistance from public dollars paid to a parent, the children’s money can be taken, no matter how long ago any overpayment occurred.      The IRS has seen plenty of excuses from people trying to get out of paying their taxes. Jackie Kucinich takes a look at the agency's own list of creative ways folks have tried to dodge tax day. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)      “While we are responsible for collecting delinquent debts owed to taxpayers, we understand the importance of ensuring that debtors are treated fairly,” Treasury’s Schramek said in a statement responding to questions from The Washington Post. He said Treasury requires that debtors be given due process.      Social Security spokeswoman Clark, who declined to discuss Grice’s or any other case, even with the taxpayer’s permission, said the agency is “sensitive to concerns about our attempts to arrange repayment of overpayments.” She said that before taking any money, Social Security makes “multiple attempts to contact debtors via the U.S. Mail and by phone.”      Grice, who works for the Food and Drug Administration and lives in Takoma Park, in the same apartment she’s resided in since 1984, never got any notice about a debt.      Social Security officials told her they had sent their notice to her post office box in Roxboro, N.C. Grice rented that box from 1977 to 1979 and never since. And Social Security has Grice’s current address: Every year, it sends her a statement about her benefits.      “Their record-keeping seems to be very spotty,” she said.      Treasury officials say that before they will take someone’s refund, the agency owed the money must certify the debt, meaning there must be evidence of the overpayment. But Social Security officials told Grice they had no records explaining the debt.      “The craziest part of this whole thing is the way the government seizes a child’s money to satisfy a debt that child never even knew about,” says Robert Vogel, Grice’s attorney. “They’ll say that somebody got paid for that child’s benefit, but the child had no control over the money and there’s no way to know if the parent ever used the money for the benefit of that kid.”      Grice, the middle of five children, said neither of her surviving siblings — one older, one younger — has had any money taken by the government. When Grice asked why she had been selected to pay the debt, she was told it was because she had an income and her address popped up — the correct one this time.      Grice found a lawyer willing to take her case without charge. Vogel is exercised about the constitutional violations he sees in the retroactive lifting of the 10-year limit on debt collection. “Can the government really bring back to life a case that was long dead?” the lawyer asked. “Can it really be right to seize a child’s money to satisfy a parent’s debt?”      But many other taxpayers whose refunds have been taken say they’ve been unable to contest the confiscations because of the cost, because Social Security cannot provide records detailing the original overpayment, and because the citizens, following advice from the IRS to keep financial documents for just three years, had long since trashed their own records.      In Glenarm, Ill., Brenda and Mike Samonds have spent the past year trying to figure out how to get back the 189.10 tax refund the government seized, claiming that Mike’s mother, who died 33 years ago, had been overpaid on survivor’s benefits after Mike’s father died in 1969.      “It was never Mike’s money, it was his mother’s,” Brenda Samonds said. “The government took the money first and then they sent us the letter. We could never get one sentence from them explaining why the money was taken.” The government mailed its notice about the debt to the house Mike’s mother lived in 40 years ago.      The Social Security spokeswoman said the agency uses a private contractor to seek current addresses and is supposed to halt collections if notices are returned as undeliverable.      After hours on the phone trying and failing to get information about the debt Mike’s mother was said to owe, the Samondses gave up.      After waiting on hold for two hours with Social Security last week, Ted Verbich also concluded it wasn’t worth the time or money to fight for the 172 the government intercepted last month.      In 1977, Verbich, now 57, was in college at the University of Maryland when he took a full-time job in an accountant’s office. Because he was earning income, he knew he had to give up the survivor’s benefits his mother had received since his father died, when Verbich was 4. But his 70 monthly checks — “They helped with the car payment,” he said — kept coming for a short time after he started work, and Verbich was notified in 1978 that he had to repay about 600. He did.      Thirty-six years later, with no notice, “they snatched my Maryland tax refund,” said Verbich, a federal worker who has lived at the same address in Glendale, Md,. for 30 years and regularly receives Social Security statements there. The feds insisted that he owed 172 but could provide no documents to back up the claim.      Verbich has given up on getting his refund, but he wants a receipt stating that his debt to his country is resolved.      “I’ll put in the request,” a Social Security clerk told Verbich, “but in reality, you’ll never get anything.”      Grice was also told there was little point in seeking a waiver of her debt. Collections can only be halted if the person passes two tests, Clark said: The taxpayer must prove that he “is without fault, and [that] repayment of the overpayment would deprive the person of income needed for ordinary living expenses.”      More than 1,200 appeals have been filed on the old cases, Clark said; taxpayers have won about 10 percent of those appeals.      The Treasury initially held the full amount of Grice’s federal and state refunds, a total of 4,462. Last week, after The Washington Post inquired about Grice’s case, the government returned the portion of her refund above the 2,996 owed on her father’s account.      But unless the feds can prove that she ever received any of the overpayment, Grice wants all of her money back.      “Look, I love a good fight, especially for principle,” she said. “My mom used to say, �?This country is carried on the backs of the little people,’ and now I see what she meant. This is really sad.” |||||Summary:","output":"The Social Security Administration announced that it will stop attempting to collect taxpayers' debts to the government that are more than 10 years old.

Write highlights for this article: Britain is bracing itself for a lashing from the elements when the driest month on record is set to be blown away by 70mph winds and heavy rain this weekend. But it has been a case of the calm before the storm today with much of the country basking in the warm conditions and clear skies - and some stunning sunsets across parts of the South. The spectacular summery weather is set to come to a dramatic end, however, with forecasters predicting that dismal conditions will settle in over the next few days. Scroll down for video. Calm before the storm: Two men enjoy what could be the last of the glorious Indian Summer weather as they take a row on the River Cam in Cambridge this morning. Forecasters have predicted dismal conditions over the next few days, but much of Britain has been enjoying the glorious weather that typified much of September. This stunning scene was captured across Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire last night, but the sun is also setting on the glorious weather with up to 60mm of rain falling in a matter of hours in some parts. Sunlight bursts through the mist over Corfe Castle in Dorset. Despite the settled weather in the last few dayts, the The Met Office has said that downpours over the next few days could lead to surface water flooding. Up to 60mm of rain could fall in a matter of hours while severe gales of up to 70mph are set to batter parts of the north with temperatures plunging by 10C. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. It is also likely to finish in the top five warmest Septembers. The Met Office warned severe gales with gusts of up to 70mph were possible in north-west Scotland in a yellow 'be aware' alert. The sun sets over Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire in a picture taken from Dunstable Downs. Severe weather warnings of rain are in place for parts of the north and west of Britain today and tomorrow. Picturesque: This autumnal scene was captured at Sycamore Gap along Hadrian's Wall last night. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. With the sun shinging and beneath clear blue skies,  a man enjoys the fine weather as he walks his dog along the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Despite the dire weather forecast, these four girls found it warm enough today to paddle in the sea at the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Fine day for a walk: The surface of the water sparkles in the October sun today as a man walks his dog along the shore at Hastings. The Chief Forecaster's assessment said: 'Although such wind speeds are not unusual across these areas of Scotland, the contrast with the recent quiet weather means that a few minor impacts may occur.' A yellow warning for rain was also issued with 'heavy and persistent' downpours predicted in parts of southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales from Friday afternoon until Saturday morning. Forecasters said between 20mm (0.8in) and 40mm (1.6in) could fall 'quite widely' across the warning area, while some places could see more than 60mm (2.4in) with much of the rain falling within a few hours. Making a splash: A 'super-pod' of more than a thousand dolphins was  spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire - as they swim further inland to feed and raise their young. Experts at The Sea Trust counted the mass off the Pembrokeshire coast in the Bristol Channel. They say the pod is at least a thousand strong but admit it could be an under-estimate as they are impossible to keep track of. Sailing volunteers on the boat 'Cartlett Lady' were surrounded for nearly three hours by 'wall to wall' dolphins as they surveyed a 35 mile stretch. The Met Office said the downpours could lead to surface water flooding, saying: 'The public should be aware of the potential for some localised impacts to travel due to surface water flooding.' It said the high pressure which settled over Britain and protected it from Atlantic depressions in September is in the process of moving - and making room for conditions more in keeping with October. Drivers are being warned of the risk of flash flooding. A man heads out early to the banks o the River Cam in Cambridgeshire for some fishing. Rain is set to sweep in over the South and East of England tomorrow morning. A team of rowers head out for an early morning row on the River Cam while a thin blanket of mist covers the trees in the back ground. The calm scenes are set to come to an end when an Atlantic front moves in across Britain. Enjoy it while it lasts: Temperatures across Britain have remained above average for the beginning of October - but the mercury could plummet by 10C in some parts with the glorious conditions expected to come to an end tomorrow. Forecasters say the high pressure that settled over Britain for much of September is finally moving away and wetter and cooler conditions are set to return. Temperatures could take a plunge in the next few days with forecasters predicting a return to conditions more in keeping with average October weather. University rowers take a breather during an early morning practice session on the River Cam. The scene is a sharp contrast to the weather predicted over the next few days. A cyclist is pictured riding along the banks of the River Cam in Cambridgeshire this morning. Temperatures topped 20C in some parts of Britain today. The sun shines through the trees along the banks of the River Cam as two women enjoy a morning row. Wet weather is set to sweep in from tonight. Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'It's a case of \\"change of month, change of weather\\". 'After precious little rain in September, autumn will fall sharply into focus tomorrow as it turns wet and windy across many areas. 'While river catchments may well be able to take this volume of water after the very dry September, a lot may fall within 12 to 24 hours, so flash flooding is likely to be the main issue for drivers in the affected areas. Dark clouds gather from the coast off Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire this afternoon with Scotland's Indian summer looking over for the time being after severe winds and rain battered much of the north last night and into this morning. Scotland and northern England is expected to see winds gusting up to 70mph as the fine spell of weather finally comes to an end. 'Be wary of places where water may accumulate; for instance, dips in the road and under bridges. 'In dark, wet conditions, it can be extremely difficult to distinguish between a road that's flooded and one that is simply very wet until it's too late. 'Tomorrow evening's rush hour could be particularly affected, so allow a bit more time if you're heading away for the weekend, and check your car's lights and wiper blades.'","output":"Recently, Britain had very dry and warm weather, but this weekend, some places will get lots of rain and strong winds. People enjoyed sunny days and beautiful sunsets, but now the weather is changing. The weather forecast says there may be floods from all the rain, so people should be careful when traveling. The warm weather in September is leaving and now the cooler and wetter weather of October is coming back. It is important to be ready for the change in weather by checking car lights and wiper blades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Imagine a house that keeps itself warm in the wintertime. Think of the savings in terms of fuel bills and unfriendly emissions. Such houses in fact exist, called \\"passive houses\\". The concept of these highly energy-efficient buildings took root in the 1990s, before slowly consolidating as a niche construction   concept in the 2000s. Are passive houses now actively moving into the mainstream as sustainable buildings? For Brian McGarry, an economics lecturer who built a family house based on passive housing criteria in the Pyrenees this year, the arguments look convincing. As his first full winter in the low energy house draws in, we asked him to keep us informed. Do passive houses work? I had never heard of a passive house in February 2012, when I purchased a plot of land. Nor did I expect that I would be persuaded to build a pre-constructed, custom-designed house based on energy-efficient passive house criteria. It promised to be easier and quicker to build, cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. The objective was to incorporate the fundamental concepts of passive energy management into my project: an airtight and highly insulated building envelope; large southfacing double or triple-glazed windows (if possible, filled with argon gas) that passively capture the energy of the sun; a heat recovery ventilation system to provide fresh air; and a simple, low-cost heating system consisting of a modern wood-burning stove, a bathroom heater and a portable radiator backup for when the sun doesn't shine and temperatures decline. No significant limitations were placed on the design, and it had excellent environmental credentials. Moreover, the cost was no more than a conventional build. After six months in use, the house is proving to be both cheap to run and remarkably comfortable-staying cool in the hot summer was effortless, as long as the windows were shuttered or shaded from the sun. Nowstaying warm in the cold, high-altitude December climate also seems easy, so far. Winter arrived in force in the...

Along with the rest of Trafford, Stretford maintains a selective education system assessed by the 11-plus examination. The proportion of pupils leaving Stretford Grammar School with five or more GCSEs at grades A*–C in 2006, was 98.3%, compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%. The proportion of students from minority ethnic backgrounds, and for whom English is an additional language, is much higher than the average.

As they find that by being able to go online and choose the things that they need to choose, and have them delivered right to their doorsteps, they could no longer be bothered with driving, the crowds, the  noise of that, and they usually get a better selection. Cornell University Marketing Professor, MeLaughlin says traditional stores can keep their customers by offering goods like clothing, which customers may want to see and try on before purchasing, as well as items that are difficult to ship. He says some traditional stores are also pleasing customers with services that set up or repair computers and electronics. Traditional stores also offer a social experience that some shoppers enjoy.

Title: Cape Fear Movie plot: Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) is a lawyer in the quiet town of New Essex, North Carolina. Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden. Cady's new lawyer, Lee Heller (Gregory Peck), files a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, vowing to have Bowden disbarred. Kersek reasons that Cady may try...

A paraphrase is a rewording or rephrasing of text that may involve a change in structure, different words, or the use of synonyms without changing the meaning. The purpose of paraphrasing is often to simplify the original text, provide clarity, or adapt the text to a different context. In this case, both sentences convey the same information that L'Estany is a municipality located in the province of Barcelona and the autonomous community of Catalonia in Spain. However, the level of rephrasing in these two sentences is minimal, as they both contain nearly identical words and phrasing, apart from the additional space between \\"L\\" and \\"Estany\\" in the first sentence, and the inclusion of an apostrophe (' ') in the second sentence. Consequently, the two paraphrases are very similar in structure and word choice, with only a minor alteration in punctuation.  For future reference, consider the following example of a more substantial paraphrase. Original sentence: \\"L'Estany is a municipality in the province of Barcelona and the autonomous community of Catalonia, Spain.\\" Paraphrased version: \\"The municipality of L'Estany can be found within Spain's province of Barcelona, situated in the autonomous region of Catalonia.\\"  In this example, the paraphrase takes on a more distinct structure and incorporates some different word choices, while maintaining the same meaning as the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife?, what is it ?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process:  - An owl leaves his nest - The owl flys out into the night - The owl looks down at the ground - The owls keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark - The owls sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey - The owl swoops down - The owl catches a mouse in his talons.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more fuel used happens, how will it affect there will be more  food for the owls.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves more fuel used. I assume you are referring to an increase in the use of fossil fuels, as they are the most common source of energy globally. The direct effect of increased fuel consumption is the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which contribute to climate change. We can now analyze if and how this perturbation affects the process described, which involves an owl hunting and catching a mouse. Increased fuel usage and the subsequent effects of climate change can lead to changes in weather patterns, temperatures, and habitats. These changes can, in turn, affect the ecosystems and the food chain. In the case of our process, the owls and mice are both part of their shared ecosystem and can be influenced by these changes. Potential direct effects of increased fuel usage on the process are: 1. Changes in the geographical distribution of owls and mice: If climate change leads to unsuitable conditions for owls and mice in certain areas, they may be forced to migrate to new habitats. This could make it harder for owls to find adequate food sources if the mice population decreases in specific regions. 2. Decreased prey availability: Climate change can lead to a decline in the populations of some species, disrupting the food chain. For example, if the vegetation that mice feed on is affected, this may result in fewer mice for owls to prey on. Potential indirect effects of increased fuel usage on the process are: 1. Disruptions in mice breeding patterns: Changes in temperature or weather patterns can affect the breeding cycles of rodents such as mice. Smaller populations of mice can mean less food for owls. 2. Adverse effects on owl hunting skills: If climate change leads to less predictable weather patterns or more extreme conditions, this could potentially affect the owl's ability to hunt effectively. For instance, more intense storms or changing visibility could make it difficult for owls to locate and catch their prey. In conclusion, while the perturbation hypothesis concerning increased fuel usage does not directly impact the owl's hunting process, it can lead to indirect effects on the food chain and the ecosystem. This could potentially result in decreased food supply for the owls, making it more challenging for them to sustain and continue their hunting process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was always sitting on the shelves alone, until one day I decided to try something new for a change, and got this game. I stared in awe at it, since it was the first ever game for the PS1 that I owned that had 4 discs. When I played it, I couldn't put the controller down, seriously. The storyline of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII Storyline, and that is hard to accomplish. When you play the game, you get so involved with the characters it's unbelievable that it's only a PS1 game, as It feels like a movie. And I believe it should be made into a movie.

Well I am one of those people who always look at those on the ends, and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good. Heck, that is how I got into final Fantasy VII, looking in a catalog, and finding it. But this is different than Final Fantasy.

Hardly any games I play are better than the Final Fantasy series, or the Dragon Quest series, but this one is.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built.  - Electronic System is a Belgian synthesizer group (by Dan Lacksman, also known from Telex).  - Fibre Channel, or FC, is a high-speed network technology (commonly running at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 128 gigabit per second rates) primarily used to connect computer data storage to servers. Fibre Channel is mainly used in storage area networks (SAN) in commercial data centers. Fibre Channel networks form a switched fabric because they operate in unison as one big switch. Fibre Channel typically runs on optical fiber cables within and between data centers.  - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.  - In the computer storage field, a Fibre Channel switch is a network switch compatible with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. It allows the creation of a Fibre Channel fabric, that is currently the core component of most storage area networks (SAN). The fabric is a network of Fibre Channel devices which allows many-to-many communication, device name lookup, security, and redundancy. FC switches implement zoning, a mechanism that disables unwanted traffic between certain fabric nodes.  - Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. is an American technology company specializing in data and storage networking products. Originally known for its leadership in Fibre Channel storage networks, the company has expanded its focus to include a wide range of products for New IP and Third platform technologies. Offerings now include routers and switches optimized for data center, campus and carrier environments, IP and Fibre Channel storage network fabrics; Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-defined networking (SDN) solutions such as a commercial edition of the OpenDaylight Project SDN Controller; and network management software that spans physical and virtual devices.  - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm  e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology.  - In electronic systems and computing, firmware is a type of software that provides control, monitoring and data manipulation of engineered products and systems. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are embedded systems (such as traffic lights, consumer appliances, remote controls and digital watches), computers, computer peripherals, mobile phones, and digital cameras. The firmware contained in these devices provides the low-level control program for the device. As of 2013, most firmware can be updated.  - A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. It generally includes redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data communications connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, fire suppression) and various security devices. Large data centers are industrial scale operations using as much electricity as a small town.  - A mobile phone is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Most modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and therefore mobile telephones are often also called \\"cellular telephones\\" or \\"cell phones\\". In addition to telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming, and digital photography. Mobile phones which offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.  - A storage area network (SAN) is a network which provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to enhance storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear to the operating system as locally attached devices. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network (LAN) by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.  - A digital camera or digicam is a camera that produces digital images that can be stored in a computer, displayed on a screen and printed. Most cameras sold today are digital, and digital cameras are incorporated into many devices ranging from PDAs and mobile phones (called camera phones) to vehicles.  - In storage area networking , Fabric OS is the firmware for Brocade Communications Systems 's Fibre Channel switches and Fibre Channel directors . It is also known as FOS and Fabos .    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'fabric os' exhibits the relationship of 'instance of'.

The cruel plant manager abandons the newborn in a dumpster. A local woman, named Luda Mae Hewitt, discovers the baby while searching for food. She names the infant Thomas and takes him to the Hewitt residence and raises the baby as her own son.Over the next 30 years, Thomas (Andrew Bryniarski) grows up and goes to work in the same slaughterhouse. When its horrid conditions cause the closure of his workplace, Thomas comes back and kills the slaughterhouse's owner with a sledgehammer; he also finds and takes a chainsaw. Charlie Hewitt (R.

Article: The drying process for a down jacket takes quite a long time, but you can help it along by removing as much moisture as possible from the coat.  Run the jacket through two or three additional spin cycles after the second rinse is complete. If possible, increase the speed of the spin with each cycle.  Squeeze the jacket by hand to remove excess moisture if you don’t have a washing machine. Don’t wring the jacket, as this could damage the feathers. Then, lay the jacket to hang on a radiator or hang it to dry. After the spin cycles, place your jacket into the dryer along with two or three clean tennis balls. As the tennis balls bounce around in the dryer with the jacket, they will fluff the feathers inside. This fluffing will prevent the feathers from clumping together, and help return their loft.  Be warned that the drying process can take up to three hours, but do not increase the heat above low. Higher heat can damage or melt parts of the jacket.  Tumble drying is the recommended method for drying down jackets, because air drying can take so long, and eventually the jacket can start to smell. However, if you don’t have a dryer, dry the jacket over a radiator if possible, or hang it to air dry. As the jacket dries, remove it from the dryer every 30 minutes to shake the jacket vigorously and break up feather clumps. You know the jacket is dry when the feathers stop clumping together, and when it feels light and fluffy again. Even if you're radiator or air drying your jacket, be sure to shake it out every half hour to break up clumps. When the jacket is fully dry, give it a final shake. Hang it somewhere to air out for a couple hours before wearing or storing the jacket. Never compress a wet down jacket, as this can destroy some of its ability to insulate properly.

Given the background: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.  and the situation: Two rivers spring from the same mountain.

Movie plot title: Seven Movie plot: In an unidentified city of constant rain and urban decay, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is preparing to retire and leave the horrors of the city. Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town. The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open. Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor. Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death. The police captain gives Somerset an evidence container with three slivers of a plastic-like material found in the stomach of the obese man, which he was forced to consume along with the spaghetti. Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly. Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it. He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost.

The novel begins in England during the Age of Enlightenment but long before the days of Darwin and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The novel is broken into two books, beginning in 1752 and 1753 and ending in 1765, with a decade or so separating the two. Matthew Paris is a central character in the novel, a physician several years older than his cousin Erasmus. Prior to the beginning of the story Paris had been imprisoned for writings on the age of the earth that clashed with a literal interpretation of the Bible, his wife Ruth dying while he was incarcerated. Wishing to escape his past, he accepts a position as surgeon on the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship built and owned by his uncle William Kemp. The elder Kemp's son, Erasmus Kemp, a young man in his early twenties, has a long-standing hatred for his cousin dating back to his younger years. He participates in a play initially, and is enamored with seventeen-year-old Sarah Wolpert, the daughter of a friend of his father. The ship's crew is made up of men available at the time around the Liverpool docks, and many are recruited by blackmail and deception.

Henry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 - December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. Although the surgery was partially successful in controlling his epilepsy, a severe side effect was that he became unable to form new memories. H.M. was widely studied from late 1957 until his death in 2008. His case played an important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. Henry Molaison was born on February 26, 1926, and experienced intractable epilepsy that has sometimes been attributed to a bicycle accident at the age of seven. (This accident was initially reported to have occurred at age nine, but was corrected by the patient's mother at a later stage.) He had partial seizures for many years, and then several tonic-clonic seizures following his 16th birthday. In 1953, he was referred to William Beecher Scoville, a neurosurgeon at Hartford Hospital, for treatment.  Scoville localized Molaison's epilepsy to his left and right medial temporal lobes (MTLs) and suggested surgical resection of the MTLs as a treatment. On September 1, 1953, at the age of 27, Molaison's bilateral medial temporal lobe resection included the removal of the hippocampal formation and adjacent structures, including most of the amygdaloid complex and entorhinal cortex. His hippocampi appeared entirely nonfunctional because the remaining 2 cm of hippocampal tissue appeared to have atrophied and because the entire entorhinal cortex, which forms the major sensory input to the hippocampus, was destroyed. Some of his anterolateral temporal cortex was also destroyed.  After the surgery, which was partially successful in its primary goal of controlling his epilepsy, Molaison developed severe anterograde amnesia: although his working memory and procedural memory were intact, he could not commit new events to his explicit memory. According to some scientists, he was impaired in his ability to form new semantic knowledge, but researchers argue over the extent of this impairment. He also had moderate retrograde amnesia, and could not remember most events in the one- to two-year period before surgery, nor some events up to 11 years before, meaning that his amnesia was temporally graded. However, his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them.  The case was first reported in a paper by Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. Near the end of his life, Molaison regularly filled in crossword puzzles. He was able to fill in answers to clues that referred to pre-1953 knowledge. For post-1953 information he was able to modify old memories with new information. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio.  He died on December 2, 2008. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What are the symptoms of that?","output":"I see that the user has not specified what \\"that\\" refers to in the question \\"What are the symptoms of that?\\". To move forward, I'll need to make an assumption based on the context of the provided paragraph. The best match for \\"that\\" based on the paragraph appears to be Molaison's condition post-surgery.  Therefore, the symptoms of Molaison's condition post-surgery include: 1. Severe anterograde amnesia: Although his working memory and procedural memory were intact, he could not commit new events to his explicit memory. 2. An impaired ability to form new semantic knowledge: Some scientists believe he was unable to form new factual knowledge, though the extent of this impairment is a matter of debate. 3. Moderate retrograde amnesia: Molaison could not remember most events in the one- to two-year period before surgery, and some events up to 11 years before, suggesting that his amnesia was temporally graded. 4. An intact ability to form long-term procedural memories: Despite his memory impairments, he could learn new motor skills, even though he could not remember learning them. The choice of these symptoms is based on the narrative of Molaison's life post-surgery as described in the paragraph and they directly respond to the user's question.

Given the contrasting methods, different outcomes were anticipated. Choosing from the provided options, it would make more sense to lean toward:  (B) Benjamin was denied a loan. My justification is based on the initial situation described. Banks often prefer to lend to individuals who have shown preparation and clear planning, as it indicates a lower risk of default. Derrick's efforts to create a business plan would most likely impress the bank officials, demonstrating his seriousness and ability to forecast financial planning. Meanwhile, Benjamin's lackadaisical approach by 'winging it' would typically not sit well with most financial institutions as it indicates a lack of foresight and may suggest an inability to service the loan in the long term, leading to the denial of his loan application."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It may sound simple, but the message is extremely important. \\"Children often don't have the experience to know that when something bad happens---they lose an important game or their best friend lets them down---it's not the end of the world,\\" explains Nancy Leffert, a senior research scientist with the Research Institute, an American adolescents  and children's research group. \\"They think their bad feelings will last for ever, or that one failure will ruin everything.\\" Unfortunately, that kind of thinking discourages motivation . \\"If a child believes that the cause of her upset is lasting, or that nothing she does will make a difference, it decreases her ability to keep on trying.\\" says Dorothy Rich, president of the MegaSkills Education Center of the Home and School Institute, based in Washington. Any time you can help your child see that a situation is not lasting, that a result can be changed, or that one opinion does not reflect reality, you give her reason to hope. Case in point: \\"When my daughter Kathy was eight, art was one of her favorite subjects,\\" says Beth, a mother of two. \\"Then she got an art teacher who gave a great deal of praise to one student and barely noticed the rest. Kathy was ready to give up until I explained to her, \\"Never stop doing your best just because one person doesn't give you praise.\\" Beth had to repeat the advice often, and finally her daughter got the message. \\"Kathy is 12 now, and art is still one of her strongest subjects.\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"Which of the following best describes the importance of reminding children that bad things don't last? A. It helps them realize that failures are permanent and can't be changed. B. It encourages them to stop trying in activities they once enjoyed. C. It instills a sense of hope and motivation, allowing them to understand that setbacks are temporary. D. It teaches them to rely on others' opinions as the ultimate measure of their self-worth. The answer to this question is: C. It instills a sense of hope and motivation, allowing them to understand that setbacks are temporary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime.  and a hint : Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.  Please answer this question : Which wildfire, the one in Texas or the one in Seattle, will have higher intensity? The answer to this question is:","output":"The wildfire in Texas is likely to have a higher intensity compared to the one in Seattle, based on the given information. There are several factors contributing to this conclusion: 1. Time of the day: The Texas wildfire is occurring during daytime, while the Seattle wildfire is during nighttime. As mentioned in the hint, wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours because of several factors like lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. The sunlight warming the ground during the day also leads to air currents traveling uphill, thereby fanning the wildfires. 2. Geographic location: Texas is situated in the southwest part of the United States, which is known for having a warmer and drier climate compared to the northwest region, where Seattle is located. This difference in climate can contribute to the difference in wildfire intensity between the two locations, with the Texas wildfire being more intense due to its warmer and drier environment. 3. Type of fire: The Texas wildfire is a brush fire, while the Seattle wildfire is a forest fire. Although both types of fire can have varying intensities, brush fires tend to spread more quickly and consume more fuel due to the nature of the vegetation involved. Additionally, since brush fires typically ignite in drier areas, they are more likely to be fed by abundant, easily combustible fuel sources, such as dried grasses and shrubs. Taking all these factors into account, the wildfire in Texas is deemed to have a higher intensity than the one in Seattle. The combined influence of the time of the day, the geographic location, and the type of fire put the Texas wildfire in a more favorable condition for increased intensity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Without additional context, it becomes difficult to determine which product or service the review is for. An effective review should provide enough contextual information to make it applicable and useful for others who might be considering the same product or service. 4. Relevance: Due to the lack of detail and context, it is unclear if the review will be relevant for other potential customers.

Choose from options. \\"Which of these is warm-blooded?\\" Choose your answer from:  * a frog  * a snake  * a vulture  * a lizard","output":"The correct answer is a vulture. Let's examine the evidence from the fact that a bird is warm-blooded, and how that connects to the options provided. Warm-blooded animals, also known as endotherms, are able to generate their own body heat and maintain a consistent internal temperature regardless of the external environment. Birds, as well as mammals, fall into this category. In contrast, cold-blooded animals, also known as ectotherms, rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. These animals tend to be more active in warm environments and less active in colder ones. Examples of cold-blooded animals include reptiles and amphibians. Now let's evaluate the options provided: 1. A frog: Frogs are amphibians, which are cold-blooded animals. They depend on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. Therefore, a frog is not warm-blooded. 2. A snake: Snakes are reptiles, another group of cold-blooded animals. Like frogs, they rely on external heat sources to maintain their optimal body temperature. So, a snake is not warm-blooded either. 3. A vulture: Vultures are a type of bird, and as previously mentioned, birds are warm-blooded animals. They can generate their own body heat and maintain a consistent internal temperature, regardless of the external environment. So, a vulture is warm-blooded. 4. A lizard: Lizards, like snakes, are reptiles, which means they are cold-blooded animals. They rely on their environment to regulate their body temperature. Hence, a lizard is not warm-blooded. Considering the evidence from the fact that birds are warm-blooded, we can determine that a vulture is the warm-blooded animal among the options provided. The other three options—frogs, snakes, and lizards—are cold-blooded animals that belong to the categories of amphibians and reptiles."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:ここに来てインフルエンザが流行します Solution:","output":"To translate the given Japanese sentence \\"ここに来てインフルエンザが流行します\\" into Farsi, let's break it down step by step. 1. First, let's identify the main elements of the sentence. ここに来て (koko ni kite) means \\"coming here\\" or \\"now that we are here\\". インフルエンザ (influenza) is \\"influenza\\" or \\"flu\\" in English. が (ga) is a subject marker. 流行します (ryūkō shimasu) means \\"It is spreading\\" or \\"It is becoming popular\\". 2. Now, let's find the corresponding Farsi words or expressions for each part: ここに来て (koko ni kite) - حالا که اینجا هستیم (hâlâ ke injâ hastim) インフルエンザ (influenza) - انفلوآنزا (anflūânzâ) 流行します (ryūkō shimasu) - در حال گسترش است (dar hâl-e gostâresh ast) 3. Finally, let's combine the Farsi words and expressions to create the translated sentence: حالا که اینجا هستیم، انفلوآنزا در حال گسترش است (hâlâ ke injâ hastim, anflūânzâ dar hâl-e gostâresh ast) So, the solution is: حالا که اینجا هستیم، انفلوآنزا در حال گسترش است (hâlâ ke injâ hastim, anflūânzâ dar hâl-e gostâresh ast) which means \\"Now that we are here, influenza is spreading.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes (b). No The answer is:","output":"(b). No While it is true that oak trees do shed their leaves seasonally each year, they are not the only species that exhibit this behavior. Vines, as you have mentioned, also shed their leaves each year, as do many other deciduous plants.

This process allows the plants to conserve water and protect themselves from the cold temperatures of winter. Examples of deciduous plants that shed their leaves seasonally each year include: 1. Maples 2. Oaks 3. Beeches 4. Birches 5. Elms 6. Willows 7. Poplars 8. Dogwoods 9. Hawthorns 10. Vines Since the question \\"what sheds their leaves seasonally each year?\\" does not specifically ask for a single answer, but instead inquires about the general category of plants exhibiting this behavior, it would be incorrect to say that the right answer is only \\"oak\\".

Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today.  Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta.  This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color.  Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is 100 to 300 feet (30 to 90 m) thick. Manakacha (see 5b in figure 1) is a cliff- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and red shale that averages 300 feet (90 m) thick in Grand Canyon. Wescogame (see 5c in figure 1) is a ledge- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 100 to 200 feet (30 to 60 m) thick. Esplanade (see 5d in figure 1) is a ledge- and cliff-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 200 to 800 feet (60 to 200 m) thick. An unconformity marks the top of the Supai Group.

These bizarre forms look as if they were delicately sculpted by hand - but in fact, they are the work of blustery winds across the Midwest. 'Snow rollers' have started sweeping into yards and fields throughout Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania thanks to the right balance of light snow, firm winds and cold temperatures. The strange sculptures have since become a hit on Twitter and Facebook as residents across the country have shared photographs of the wispy forms and the fields where they've found them. They are usually not tightly-packed enough to be picked up, but some images on Twitter show people have succeeded in taking them inside, in a bid to preserve their shapes. Works of art: The last time snow rollers - also known as snow doughnuts - were reported in western","output":"Pennsylvania was back in 2007, making this recent phenomenon an uncommon and interesting sight for many. Snow rollers form when a certain combination of meteorological conditions is met, creating stunning, ephemeral sculptures that delight and mystify those who are fortunate enough to witness them. Snow rollers, also known as snow doughnuts or snow bales, are cylindrical snow formations that occur when light, fluffy snow is blown by strong winds across a relatively smooth surface, such as a field or lawn. As the snow is blown along, it begins to accumulate and roll, eventually forming a cylinder shape that can vary in size, ranging from as small as a golf ball to as large as a car tire. The delicate nature of the snow means that these sculptures are often short-lived, as they can easily be damaged by further wind, precipitation, or fluctuating temperatures. To form a snow roller, several specific conditions must be met: 1. A layer of ice or crusty snow: The surface beneath the loose snow must be smooth and slippery, which is often achieved after a period of melting followed by a rapid freeze. 2. Loose, powdery snow: The snow must be light and fluffy in order to be easily blown by the wind, and it must also be sticky enough to cling to itself as it rolls. 3. Strong, gusty winds: Winds must be strong enough to initiate rolling, but not so powerful that they break the delicate formations apart. 4. Adequate snow cover: There must be sufficient snow to allow for the continuous accumulation as the rollers form. The rarity of snow rollers can be attributed to the precise conditions necessary for their formation, as well as their evanescent nature.Due to the susceptibility of these sculptures to environmental factors, it is no surprise that people are excited by their appearance and rush to capture photos, as their presence is often fleeting. As the news of snow rollers appearing throughout the Midwest has spread, social media has played a crucial role in sharing images and experiences of this captivating phenomenon. From casual observer to professional photographers, people have been captivated by the whimsical beauty of these fragile formations. Beyond pure aesthetic enjoyment, snow rollers also serve as a striking reminder of the power and intricacy of natural processes. They perfectly illustrate how even the seemingly chaotic force of wind can give rise to delicate and mesmerizing works of art. Weather enthusiasts and curious onlookers alike revel in the opportunity to study and appreciate this rare weather occurrence, reinforcing the importance of maintaining an awareness and respect for the wonders found within our natural world. In conclusion, snow rollers are a rare and enchanting phenomenon that provide a unique glimpse into the artistic capacity of the natural world. The specific combination of meteorological conditions required to create these fragile, wind-sculpted formations ensures that their appearance is an exceptional and treasured event. The delight and fascination surrounding snow rollers, from social media-fueled excitement to scientific intrigue, highlights the endless capacity for wonder that can be derived from our ever-changing and awe-inspiring environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  and the situation: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city.

Hypothesis: in the 90's British people by 1/2 agreed with the final agreement","output":"Yes, we can draw the following hypothesis from the context, but with some modifications to ensure accuracy and clarity: Hypothesis: In the late 1990s, around half of British Columbians agreed with the Nisga'a Final Agreement as a positive step. This hypothesis is derived from the data provided in the context. The context mentions an Angus Read poll from October 22, 1998, in which 51% of British Columbians viewed the Nisga'a Final Agreement as a step in the right direction. It is important to note that in this context, \\"British\\" refers to the residents of British Columbia, a province in Canada, not the people of the United Kingdom. The context also states that 33% of those polled held the opposite view, implying that they believed the Nisga'a Final Agreement was not a step in the right direction. Moreover, 16% of the respondents were unsure of their views. These data points provide a detailed breakdown of the varying opinions on the Nisga'a Final Agreement during that time in British Columbia. To further support this hypothesis, it would be helpful to consider the historical background of the Nisga'a Final Agreement itself. The Nisga'a Final Agreement was a significant treaty negotiation that took place in British Columbia, Canada, in the late 1990s. It was an agreement between the Canadian federal government, the provincial government of British Columbia, and the Nisga'a Nation, a group of indigenous people from the northwest coast of British Columbia. The agreement aimed to address issues such as Nisga'a land ownership, self-government, and financial compensation. It was a complex and contentious issue that raised concerns about the rights of indigenous people in Canada, with many individuals having strong opinions about its impact on Canadian society. Thus, the hypothesis that around half of British Columbians in the late 1990s agreed with the Nisga'a Final Agreement as a positive step is grounded in the context provided by the Angus Read poll. However, it is important to consider that public opinion may have evolved since then or that other factors may have influenced the poll results. Nonetheless, this hypothesis gives us insight into the general opinion climate surrounding the Nisga'a Final Agreement in the late 1990s in British Columbia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In many situations, determining the most suitable approach to addressing a problem or making a decision is a complex process that requires considering various factors and perspectives. Businesses, institutions, and individuals often need to make decisions in a context that is highly dynamic and unpredictable. As a result, what may be deemed as the most effective solution in one instance might not be the most suitable choice in another. For instance, the effectiveness of a particular management style or decision-making strategy could vary significantly across different organizations given their unique structures, internal cultures, and workforce personalities. In some organizations, a more hierarchical management approach could yield better results, while other firms might benefit from a more decentralized and collaborative approach. Similarly, when it comes to problem-solving, specific methods and tools may prove useful in addressing certain types of issues but may not be as effective if applied to other situations. For example, brainstorming might work for generating creative ideas and identifying viable solutions, while a more analytical approach may be preferable for industries that are highly quantitative and data-driven. Moreover, factors such as organizational size, available resources, industry dynamics, and external pressures could all have a significant bearing on the appropriate course of action. A small start-up, for example, may need to adopt a more flexible and agile mindset to survive and thrive in a highly competitive market, necessitating continuous adaptation and innovation. In contrast, larger corporations may be more constrained by bureaucratic systems and regulations, calling for greater emphasis on stability and risk mitigation. Additionally, the way organizations manage their relationships with stakeholders can play a crucial role in determining the most appropriate course of action. Engaging with customers, employees, suppliers, and others in a manner that effectively balances competing interests and demonstrates a commitment to ethical behavior and social responsibility can ultimately drive success over the long term. In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to identifying the right way to approach various challenges and decisions. The most effective strategies and methods are contingent on a multitude of factors, including the specific circumstances at hand and the broader context in which organizations operate. Decision-makers should aim to remain cognizant of these complexities and adapt their approaches accordingly to ensure that they are best positioned for success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

Summarize this article: Image copyright Artur Żmijewski Image caption Jewish groups want senior Polish officials to condemn the video      Holocaust survivor groups have asked the Polish president to explain how artists were able to film a naked game of tag inside a Nazi camp gas chamber.      The film shows men and women running around laughing at the former Stutthof camp, where 65,000 people were killed.      Game of Tag, shot in 1999 by Artur Żmijewski, was exhibited in Krakow in 2015 despite Israeli objections.      But the filming location was not known until this year, following a visit by the British Royal Family.      Experts compared footage from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's visit to Stutthof and its gas chamber with the Polish video.      In their letter, groups including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which investigates Nazi war criminals, and the Center Organization of Holocaust Survivors in Israel asked President Andrzej Duda if Mr Żmijewski had had permission to make the film and whether there were rules of conduct at Stutthof.      They also said that \\"no comment or word of critique was heard from Polish official sources regarding the video\\" and asked President Duda to \\"clearly, properly condemn this so-called artwork\\".      Image copyright EPA Image caption The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's visited Stutthof in July      \\"It's really outrageous. I hope the Polish president will put in place regulations to make sure stuff like this doesn't happen again,\\" the Wiesenthal Center's chief Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff told the BBC.      \\"It was banned in Germany, Estonia took it down when we contacted them. In Poland for some reason, which lost six million people - three million Jews and three million Poles - they didn't get it,\\" he added.      Jerusalem-based lawyer David Schonberg first noticed that Mr Żmijewski's video was shot in Stutthof after noticing that footage from William and Catherine's visit in July showed the same stains on the walls, ledge along one side, plughole in the centre and doors at each end.      Experts at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem confirmed the finding.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts compared footage from the royal visit to the video      Mr Schonberg told the BBC that more important than the video itself was the \\"apparent indifference\\" to it in Poland.      \\"This is a problem that needs to be addressed. If people are not sufficiently sensitive to the terrible acts of the Holocaust and do not respect its victims then proper conduct in the sites in Poland cannot be properly secured,\\" he said.      \\"This also requires proper scrutiny of these sites and making sure that objectionable materials that are so insensitive to the memory of the Holocaust will not be brought on public display.\\"      Mr Schonberg said the video's reception in Poland was particularly hard to understand as the majority of those who died at Stutthof were Polish non-Jews.      The 2015 Krakow exhibition, Poland-Israel-Germany - The experience of Auschwitz, was sponsored by the Israeli embassy, which then called for part of the video to be removed after Jewish groups protested. But the Krakow Art Museum said it should be shown because it was a matter of freedom of expression.      A description of Mr Żmijewski on the Warsaw Art Museum's website states that the people in the video are having fun, \\"but they are also very serious. They know where they are - in the gas chamber of a former Nazi extermination camp\\".      The Baltic death camp where thousands perished ||||| Holocaust survivors have voiced anger over a video artwork that showed naked people playing a game of tag in a Nazi gas chamber.      Several Jewish organisations have written jointly to Poland's president Andrzej Duda, demanding to know if authorities gave permission for the footage to be filmed at the Stutthof concentration camp, where 65,000 people were murdered during World War Two.      Artur Żmijewski's film, entitled Game of Tag, was displayed at Krakow's Museum of Contemporary Art in 2015 as part of an exhibition about Auschwitz.      No details about where it was recorded were divulged at the time, but the work was denounced as \\"revolting and a total insult to the victims\\" by some Jewish leaders.      Researchers have now discovered film's location was Stutthof, about 20 miles east of Gdańsk, the Times of Israel reported.      The Organisation of Holocaust Survivors in Israel and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, a Jewish research and human rights group, are among those demanding answers from the Polish government and the management at the concentration camp site, which now houses a museum.      Their letter to President Andrzej Duda asked whether artists did “obtain permission from the Stutthof administrators to make this video, what rules exist for proper conduct at the site, how these are enforced”.      It notes that \\"no comment or word of critique was heard from Polish official sources regarding the video, neither from the Prime Minister’s office, nor from any official or government representative\\".      The video was filmed in 1999 and displayed in 2015 in an exhibition titled “Poland – Israel – Germany. The experience of Auschwitz”, which examined the Nazi death camp's impact on public discourse.      The exhibition was endorsed and sponsored by the Israeli Embassy in Poland. But after an outcry from Jewish groups, the embassy called for the video be removed.      “It is the most disgusting thing I’ve seen in a long time,” Efraim Zuroff, the Wiesenthal Centre’s chief Nazi hunter, said in 2015. “It is just revolting and a total insult to the victims and anyone with any sense of morality or integrity.”      The museum withdrew the work in response to criticism but later reinstated it, defending freedom of artistic expression.

First question: What should be one's relation to the internet and its “discussions” in times of studying or important transition phases? Second question: What are some good case studies of the importance of investing in branding, especially as it relates to start-ups? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: One's relation to the internet and its \\"discussions\\" in times of studying or important transition phases should be moderated and carefully managed. The internet can be an extremely valuable source of information and networking opportunities, but it can also be distracting and detrimental to one's productivity if not properly regulated. Here are a few suggestions for effectively managing your time online during these critical periods: 1. Set priorities: Understand the importance of the task at hand, and prioritize your online usage accordingly. Focus on research, educational materials, and resources that directly relate to your studies or the transition you are going through. 2. Limit distractions: Use website blockers, browser extensions, or other tools to minimize distractions caused by social media, news feeds, and other time-wasting sites. 3. Time management: Allocate specific periods of the day for engaging in online discussions, researching, or browsing the web. This will help keep your internet usage in check and ensure you are not compromising on your primary objectives. 4. Curate your online presence: Follow carefully selected forums or discussion boards that are relevant to your study area or the transition phase you are going through. This will help you stay connected with like-minded individuals and gain helpful insights while avoiding unrelated discussions or debates. 5. Use digital tools responsibly: Platforms like Google Scholar, academic databases, and online collaboration tools can greatly enhance your productivity and efficiency when studying or transitioning phases. Use these resources to your advantage, but do not overly rely on them to the point where they become a crutch. Second question: Branding is important in establishing a unique identity for a startup and communicating the company's values and offerings to potential customers. Some good case studies of the importance of investing in branding for start-ups include: 1. Airbnb: The famous online marketplace for hospitality services underwent a complete rebranding exercise in 2014. Its unique logo also referred to as the \\"Bélo\\", combined with a new visual identity, portrayed a sense of belonging and community. This rebranding played a significant role in Airbnb's growth and positioned the company as a global leader in the hospitality industry. 2. Slack: The popular workplace communication tool utilized branding as a vital component of its growth strategy. Slack differentiated itself from other collaboration tools on the market by forging a strong, friendly, and human-centric personality. This branding strategy allowed Slack to resonate with its target audience, making it the go-to choice for businesses of all sizes. 3. Mailchimp: The email marketing platform successfully positioned itself as a user-friendly and powerful tool for small businesses, thanks in large part to its strong and recognizable branding. The company's friendly and quirky mascot \\"Freddie\\" along with its cohesive design language enabled Mailchimp to garner trust among customers, driving adoption and growth. 4. Warby Parker: This innovative eyewear company's branding incorporates a sleek, minimalist design and focuses on its promise to provide affordable, socially responsible, and stylish eyewear. Warby Parker's branding resonated with customers, leading to the company rapidly becoming an iconic brand in the eyewear industry. 5. Casper: The mattress and sleep product start-up cleverly used branding to create a comfortable and friendly image, setting itself apart from traditional mattress retailers. With its simple, clean design and focus on modern customer experience, Casper's branding helped carve a unique niche for the company in a crowded market. In conclusion, the two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question relates to managing one's relationship with the internet during crucial periods in life, while the second question focuses on the importance of branding for start-ups and provides examples of successful case studies."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Proper preparation of your boat for transport requires careful planning and attention to detail on both the part of the owner and the boat transport service companies involved. It is the responsibility of the owner.","output":"to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to guarantee a smooth and safe transportation experience. Here are some essential aspects to consider when preparing your boat for transport: 1. Choose the right boat transport company: Research and select a reliable, experienced, and fully licensed boat transport company that specializes in moving boats like yours. Check online reviews and ask for recommendations from fellow boaters or marinas. Obtain several quotes to compare pricing and services offered. 2. Measure your boat: Accurately measure your boat's dimensions, including length, beam, height, and weight. Providing precise measurements will help the transport company determine the appropriate trailer and equipment needed for the move, ensuring the safety of your boat during transit. 3. Secure and remove all loose items: Before loading the boat onto the trailer, perform a thorough inspection of your vessel. Remove any unsecured items and store them safely to avoid damage or loss. Tie down items that must remain on deck, such as masts, antennas, or dinghies, to prevent movement during transport. 4. Empty fuel and water tanks: To reduce the weight of your boat and minimize potential hazards, drain both fuel and water tanks to a minimal level. Additionally, disconnect and store fuel lines and batteries in a secure location. 5. Protect fragile boat parts: Wrap all fragile components, such as propellers, antennas, and navigation equipment, in protective material. Remove any detachable parts that may pose a risk to the boat during transportation, and store them safely. 6. Inspect the boat's exterior: Check for any existing scratches, dents, or damage to the boat's exterior and take photos for documentation purposes. If any issues arise during the transport process, this documentation will provide valuable evidence when filing a claim with the transport company or their insurance provider. 7. Prepare for loading and unloading: Ensure that proper loading and unloading procedures are in place. This may include securing a spot at a marina that can accommodate both the boat transporter and the boat itself. Make arrangements for any necessary permits and notify the marina staff of the boat's arrival and departure times. 8. Inspect the trailer: If you are using your trailer, make sure it is in good working condition and prepared for the journey. Check the tires, brakes, and hitch, and ensure that all lights are functioning correctly. If the transport company is providing the trailer, inquire about the equipment's condition and maintenance history. 9. Review the transport route: Discuss the transportation route with the boat transport company. Make sure to identify any potential obstacles or challenges along the road, such as low bridges, narrow roads, or weight-restricted roadways, and plan accordingly. 10. Obtain insurance: Ensure that your boat is adequately insured for transport. Verify the boat transport company's insurance coverage and determine if you need additional coverage through your insurance provider for added protection during the move. These steps will help ensure a smooth and stress-free boat transport process. By taking the time to prepare your boat for transport, you can rest assured that both your vessel and your peace of mind will be safeguarded throughout the journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Leigh Griffiths added the second within the space of five minutes. Griffiths fired a third late on. It was the Scotland striker's 32nd goal of an increasingly impressive season. For Celtic, a stressful day ended happily with an important win and the sight of Patrick Roberts, their loan signing from Manchester City, making a bright debut. Celtic finished the match with a convincing attacking midfield trio of Scott Allan, Ryan Christie and Roberts. The three of them combined to set up Griffiths, who rifled home in typically ruthless fashion. Caley Thistle have made strides in the last few months, moving from ninth in the Premiership in mid-December to sixth before this game on the back of an impressive run. In fairness, they took their confidence with them on the road south. The only problem was that they left their finishing power behind. John Hughes' team played some terrific stuff and caused Celtic an amount of trouble before the champions found themselves, Their profligacy was terminal and it started as early as the 18th minute, when an Iain Vigurs free-kick on the left was completely missed by Craig Gordon. Standing alone behind the goalkeeper was Gary Warren, who duly missed the target with a header that could comfortably be described as a sitter. Celtic huffed and puffed, but the best moments all belonged to Inverness. Just after the half-hour, they had a breakaway and a four-on-two with the Celtic defence. They butchered the moment through their own indecision and the marvellous work-rate of Griffiths, who made the key intervention in his own penalty area. There was a restless mood inside the stadium. Celtic's attacking midfield trio of Stuart Armstrong, Stefan Johansen and Mackay-Steven were passive and error-prone and their supporters were not slow in telling them. Boos rang out at the break and, within three minutes of the restart, Inverness were in again. It was another counter-attack, after Mackay-Steven had been hustled off the ball. Jordan Roberts went by the one-paced Erik Sviatchenko with a gob-smacking ease, but his effort was weak and Gordon dealt with it. That was the sliding doors moment for the visitors. Within 11 minutes, Celtic had scored twice and the game was up. In those moments, Hughes, standing motionless on the touchline, must have pondered football's capacity to inflict pain. Mackay-Steven scored the first after Inverness took too long to get rid of a loose ball, the midfielder snapping his shot past goalkeeper Owain Fon Williams. Then it was Griffiths - unsurprisingly - who added a second when he went on a diagonal run across the Inverness penalty area and then fired across Fon Williams and into the corner of his net. Celtic bossed it from there. Johansen should have made it three but missed, much to the chagrin of the home crowd. Their top scorer's second, and Celtic's third, was a classic moment of Griffiths efficiency, aided and abetted by three young players who warrant a lot more game time in the coming months.

The specific discount rate mentioned (3%) is prescribed by the EPA's Guidelines for Economic Analysis (US EPA, 2000a), which further reaffirms that there are results calculated by the EPA.  A discount rate evaluates the present value of future benefits and costs to society, and the EPA recommends a 3% discount rate.

Joseph Guilherme Raposo, OIH (February 8, 1937 - February 5, 1989) was a Portuguese-American composer, songwriter, pianist, television writer and lyricist, best known for his work on the children's television series Sesame Street, for which he wrote the theme song, as well as classic songs such as \\"Bein' Green\\" and \\"C Is For Cookie\\". He also wrote music for television shows such as The Electric Company, Shining Time Station and the sitcoms Three's Company and The Ropers, including their theme songs. In addition to these works, Raposo also composed extensively for the DePatie-Freleng Enterprises such as Halloween Is Grinch Night, Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You? and The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat. In 1971, Children's Television Workshop created the show The Electric Company, meant to help teach reading to children who had outgrown Sesame Street. Raposo served as the musical director of the show for its first three seasons, and contributed songs throughout the show's run, until 1977.  Raposo performed joke characters for film segments on The Electric Company similar in style to what he had done on Sesame Street. One segment showed him attempting to get dressed in jacket and necktie against a white wall under the word \\"dressing\\", until the prefix \\"un-\\" appears and attaches itself to the prior word, forcing him to engage in a mock striptease which ends with him modestly hopping off-screen and tossing the remainder of his clothing into an empty chair left on-screen. In a variation of this film, he is shown packing a suitcase when the \\"un-\\" prefix returns and pesters him using the behavior of a meddling fly until, exasperated, Raposo strikes the word with a hammer, knocking it unconscious into the suitcase, which he then triumphantly slams shut with a smirk.  Raposo enjoyed doing animation voicework. Other forays of his into the craft included both the tenor singing role of \\"master pickler\\" Gil Gickler in DePatie-Freleng's Dr. Seuss cartoon program Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You? and Gickler's spoken dialogue. Raposo also performed at least three other character voices in the cartoon, including a Groogen musician whose \\"flugel bugle\\" is destroyed by Pontoffel in an attack flyover, as the ancient Senior Fairy above McGillicuddy who oversees the fairy squadron's worldwide search for the missing Pock and his piano, and as an angry Groogen dairywoman spilt milk upon by a too-close fly-by of Pontoffel's.  The HBO animated adaptation of Madeline, for which Raposo composed the music and songs (with writer/lyricist Judy Rothman), aired four months after Raposo's death; the cartoon The Smoggies, for which Raposo wrote the theme song, premiered in Canada.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How many years did he write songs?","output":"Joseph Guilherme Raposo wrote songs for many years. It's not clear exactly how many years he wrote songs, but he worked on Sesame Street from the beginning in 1969 and continued to write songs for different projects until his death in 1989. So he was creating music for at least 20 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:The city's community garden was demolished for yet another what? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - wasteland - ocean - desert - parking lot - flowers A:","output":"The city's community garden was demolished for yet another parking lot. Considering the options provided, the most suitable answer would be \\"parking lot\\" because it is a possibility in an urban environment. A community garden is usually a shared green space located within a city, where the members of the community plant and tend to various types of flowers, edible plants, and other flora. It serves as a beautiful and useful space for local residents, but can also be a valuable piece of real estate for other purposes, especially if it is located in a densely populated area. The idea of converting a community garden into a wasteland, ocean, or desert is not feasible since these are natural landscapes and typically cannot be artificially created within a city. Moreover, these options do not make logical sense as there are no benefits in intentionally creating these environments in an urban area. In contrast, a parking lot, although it is an unfortunate loss of a valuable community space, can be created in an urban setting and may be needed to accommodate the increasing number of vehicles in the city. As for the option of replacing the community garden with flowers, though a potential idea, it still does not present any clear indication of why or for what reason the garden was demolished. It is important to consider the context and purpose behind the demolition of the community garden, and a simple garden of flowers would not seem to be a logical or sustainable reason to demolish an existing, thriving area. In conclusion, based on the provided options, the most suitable answer to the question is that the city's community garden was demolished for yet another parking lot. This represents the unfortunate reality that many green spaces in urban environments face: the continuous pressures of urbanization and the need for new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population can lead to the elimination of valuable green spaces, even though they provide essential services and amenities to the community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Q: What is the process in which a liquid changes to a solid?    Choices:  - condensation  - boiling  - melting  - freezing  A: Answer:","output":"The process in which a liquid changes to a solid is called freezing.  Freezing, also known as solidification, is a phase transition that occurs when a substance loses its thermal energy and its temperature decreases, eventually reaching the substance's freezing point. At this point, the motion of its particles slows down significantly, and the substance begins to form a crystalline structure as it transitions from a liquid state to a solid state.  To further understand the freezing process, let us delve into some of its main aspects: 1. Freezing point: The freezing point is the temperature at which a liquid turns into a solid. For water, this occurs at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard conditions (1 atmosphere pressure). However, the freezing points of other substances may vary depending on their chemical properties and the external pressure applied. 2. Crystalline structure: As a liquid cools down and its particles lose energy, they begin to slow down and arrange themselves in a fixed and orderly pattern called a crystalline structure. This structure is characteristic of solid materials, giving them their rigidity and resistance to deformation. 3. Latent heat of fusion: The latent heat of fusion, also known as the enthalpy of fusion, is the heat energy required to change a substance from a solid to a liquid state at its melting point (and vice versa) without any change in temperature. During freezing, the substance releases this latent heat as it changes to a solid state, while the substance absorbs the heat when melting. 4. Supercooling: In some cases, a liquid can be cooled below its freezing point without transitioning to a solid—a phenomenon known as supercooling. This can be observed when water droplets in clouds remain in a liquid state even when the temperature is below freezing. Eventually, these supercooled droplets may come into contact with a surface or particles in the air, acting as a nucleus and triggering the freezing process. 5. Purity and freezing point depression: The presence of impurities or solutes in a liquid can affect its freezing point—a concept known as freezing point depression. The addition of solute particles disrupts the crystal formation process and requires a lower temperature for the substance to freeze. For example, adding salt to water lowers its freezing point, leading to the use of salt in winter to de-ice roads and sidewalks. In conclusion, the process in which a liquid changes to a solid is freezing. This process involves the cooling of the substance, the formation of crystalline structures, and the release of latent heat of fusion. It is important to note that the freezing point, crystallization, and other factors related to freezing may vary depending on the purity of the substance and the presence of other components."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Title: More fashion and fluff than exercise stuff Product review: While I rarely subscribe to magazines, I was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so I signed up for a one year subscription to Shape. Before and during college I was a ballet dancer, but after entering the real, 9-5 working world half a year ago, exercise time became more difficult to find. Unfortunately, I found that Shape magazine was not really about exercise at all. It was about beauty products, fancy new-age spas and resorts, and trendy workout accessories. I was also shocked by the models on the magazine's covers and pages. Not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing. I finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through, lacy top on the front of it, visible nipples and all. Workout wear? I think not! Trust me, the woman belonged in a porn magazine, not my exercise magazine! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product, Shape magazine, in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses disappointment in the magazine's content as they were looking for motivation to exercise but found that Shape focused more on fashion, beauty products, and trendy accessories rather than actual exercise advice or guidance. Furthermore, the reviewer was dismayed by the models featured on the magazine's covers and pages, which they felt were inappropriate and overly sexualized for an exercise magazine. The inclusion of a woman with visible nipples on one of the magazine's covers ultimately led to the reviewer canceling their subscription, further emphasizing their dissatisfaction and negative perspective on the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What successor improvement contributed to sanitation?\\"  Context: \\"Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848. His successor, Napoleon III, and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers, and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The successor improvement that made a significant contribution to sanitation in Paris during Napoleon III's reign and Haussmann's tenure as prefect of the Seine can be credited to a combination of several pivotal advancements in urban planning and infrastructure. One of the most notable improvements was the construction and modernization of the city's sewer system under their guidance. Before delving into the details of these improvements, it is essential to acknowledge the background and context of the time. In the mid-19th century, the streets of Paris were congested, and the city's infrastructure was deteriorating. This led to a multitude of sanitation issues, including poor waste management, contaminated drinking water, and the rapid spread of diseases such as cholera. Napoleon III and Haussmann were determined to address these problems through a series of large-scale public works projects aimed at transforming Paris into a modern, clean, and functional city. One major successor improvement that significantly contributed to sanitation was the development of a centralized and efficient sewer system. Under Haussmann's direction, an expansive network of sewers was constructed, replacing the outdated and insufficient sewer system that predated their administration. These new sewers were larger and better equipped to handle the increasing amounts of waste produced by Paris' growing population. Additionally, they were designed to prevent waste accumulation and facilitate regular maintenance, which greatly improved overall sanitation and the health of the city. In conjunction with the new sewer system, Haussmann's efforts to redesign the streets of Paris also had a significant impact on sanitation. The construction of wide boulevards enabled better circulation of air and sunlight, reducing dampness and improving overall cleanliness. Furthermore, these wider streets facilitated easier access for sanitation workers and other officials tasked with maintaining clean and healthy conditions in the city. Another key improvement was the construction of new aqueducts and water infrastructure to supply clean water to the city's inhabitants. By providing a centrally controlled and regulated supply of water, it became easier to prevent contamination and ensure the overall safety and hygiene of the city's drinking water supply. Lastly, the creation of new parks, such as the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, contributed to improved sanitation by providing green spaces for residents to enjoy. These parks not only offered recreational opportunities but also functioned as \\"lungs\\" for the city, offering fresh air and enhancing the overall quality of the urban environment. In conclusion, the successor improvement that contributed to sanitation in Paris during Napoleon III's reign and Haussmann's tenure as the prefect of the Seine can be attributed to an array of advancements in urban planning, infrastructure, sewer systems, and water supply management. These large-scale public works projects radically transformed the city, laying the foundation for modern Paris and its impressive standards of cleanliness and public health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who has devised and elaborate scheme against Lufton with Pindalest? , can you please find it?   Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men.

Explanation: The first method mentioned (without circling bad area with a colored marker) is the correct answer because it provides a complete and effective approach to test for leaks in flotation devices. By filling each inflatable device with air and spraying it with a soap-and-water mixture, you can observe if any bubbles are formed, which would indicate air escaping and thus a leak. Repeating this process for each device helps ensure their leak-proof nature before mounting. The second method (circling bad area with a colored marker) is incorrect as it only differs from the first method by including an unnecessary step. Circling the bad area with a colored marker is not a part of the process to check if the flotation devices are leak-proof. While marking the leak location could be helpful in repairing the device later, it is not essential to the goal of checking for leaks."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Popeye goes to see Olive Oyl, riding on a whale while singing his theme song. In the town, locals give Popeye dirty looks. One local tries to shoot Popeye, but because of Popeye's strength, the bullet hits Popeye on the back of his head, and hits the local who tried to shoot him. The local falls from the roof to the ground. He goes to a store named \\"Alla Kinda Flowers,\\" where he requests a bouquet for Olive. After a while, a local gives Popeye a toothy while mocking him. To get even, Popeye smacks the local's teeth out, and they crunch together in his mouth. The scene then cuts to Olive, dancing in a tavern, entertaining everybody. Popeye walks in using the swinging old-style doors. Olive notices Popeye, patiently sitting at a table. Olive dances to Popeye. Popeye gives Olive her \\"bouquet\\" (which consists of only one flower) and Olive dances away with a leap. Olive's feet gets stuck into two spittoons.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"If by \\"suppose eggs happens\\" you mean an increase or decrease in the number of eggs used in the batter or a change in the way eggs are incorporated, it could have an effect on the process and the resulting pancakes. 1. If more eggs are used, the batter may become denser, and the pancakes might end up thicker and less fluffy. This change could require an adjustment to the cooking time and temperature to ensure that the pancakes cook evenly. 2. If fewer eggs are used or if no eggs are used, the pancakes could lack structure and be less fluffy or more delicate. It might be necessary to adjust other ingredients (e.g., adding a different leavening agent or a binding ingredient like flaxseed) to achieve the desired pancake texture. 3. If the incorporation method for eggs changes, such as beating them separately to create a foam before folding them into the batter, this could result in fluffier pancakes as the air trapped in the foam will help the pancakes to rise during cooking. Overall, the perturbation to the egg content or method could have both direct and indirect effects on the pancake-making process, and adjustments may need to be made.

The GroundHoggz, in this four-man incarnation, remained together for eight years.  While performing, Fresh Kid Ice of 2 Live Crew took notice and asked him to be his hype man, a shortly after he took him for a show in Hawaii. They developed a long lasting friendship, Flo Rida considers this period as his schooling. He would often bring his group around when performing with him. They were eventually all invited as featured guests on Fresh Kid Ice's fourth album Freaky Chinese (2004).  Flo Rida's work with 2 Live Crew member Fresh Kid Ice, attracted the attention of DeVante Swing, a member of the band Jodeci. However, he was rejected by several of the major labels, so he sought many other jobs outside of music. After graduating from high school in 1998, he studied international business management at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for two months and attended Barry University for two months.

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  I am facing a new situation today: Iceland and Ireland both used agriculture as a the main component of their economies. Ireland used lots of fertilizer and had big environmental problems as a result. Iceland does a lot of greenhouse agriculture using geothermal energy, so it is more protective towards the environment.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country had less fertilizer in their bodies of water? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, it appears that Iceland likely had less fertilizer in their bodies of water compared to Ireland. The background article discusses how rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away into bodies of water, which can lead to harmful algae growth and the creation of dead zones due to oxygen depletion. In the new situation, we learn that Ireland used significant amounts of fertilizer in their agriculture, which likely led to the aforementioned environmental issues. On the other hand, Iceland is known for using greenhouse agriculture powered by geothermal energy, which is a more environmentally friendly approach. Greenhouse agriculture allows for the controlled use of water, nutrients, and other resources, resulting in a more efficient and sustainable farming method. As such, it is less likely for excessive fertilizer runoffs to occur in Iceland. Moreover, utilizing geothermal energy, a renewable and clean source of power, further contributes to the reduction of environmental hazards. In conclusion, considering the environmental implications of traditional agriculture involving heavy use of fertilizer, as experienced by Ireland, and the more sustainable and controlled approach of greenhouse agriculture in Iceland, it is reasonable to infer that Iceland had less fertilizer in their bodies of water compared to Ireland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales, on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate the police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.Following a mid-year tour of the United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music at the height of the British Invasion.  Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, \\"Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years. Whether such a deal can be done, Trump declared on Saturday, is something he will know almost... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Which entity is this text about? \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" is a Christmas carol that tells a story of a Bohemian king going on a journey and braving harsh winter weather to give alms to a poor peasant on the Feast of Stephen (December 26, the Second Day of Christmas). During the journey, his page is about to give up the struggle against the cold weather, but is enabled to continue by following the king's footprints, step for step, through the deep snow. The legend is based on the life of the historical Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia or Svaty Vaclav in Czech (907-935). The name Wenceslas is a Latinised version of the modern Czech language \\"Vaclav\\". The tune is that of \\"Tempus adest floridum\\" (\\"It is time for flowering\\"), a 13th-century spring carol in 76 76 Doubled Trochaic metre first published in the Finnish song book Piae Cantiones in 1582. Piae Cantiones is a collection of seventy-four songs compiled by Jaakko Suomalainen, the Protestant headmaster of Turku Cathedral School, and published by Theodoric Petri, a young Catholic printer. The book is a unique document of European songs intended not only for use in church, but also schools, thus making the collection a unique record of the late medieval period.  A text beginning substantially the same as the 1582 \\"Piae\\" version is also found in the German manuscript collection Carmina Burana as CB 142, where it is substantially more carnal; CB 142 has clerics and virgins playing the \\"game of Venus\\" (goddess of love) in the meadows, while in the Piae version they are praising the Lord from the bottom of their hearts.  The text of Neale's carol bears no relationship to the words of \\"Tempus Adest Floridum\\". In or around 1853, G. J. R. Gordon, the British envoy and minister in Stockholm, gave a rare copy of the 1582 edition of Piae Cantiones to Neale, who was Warden of Sackville College, East Grinstead, Sussex and to the Reverend Thomas Helmore (Vice-Principal of St. Mark's College, Chelsea). The book was entirely unknown in England at that time. Neale translated some of the carols and hymns, and in 1853, he and Helmore published twelve carols in Carols for Christmas-tide (with music from Piae Cantiones). In 1854, they published a dozen more in Carols for Easter-tide and it was in these collections that Neale's original hymn was first published.  The tune has also been used for the Christmas hymn Mary Gently Laid Her Child, by Joseph S. Cook (1859-1933); GIA's hymnal, Worship uses \\"Tempus Adest Floridum\\" only for Cook's hymn. Entity:","output":"The text is about the Christmas carol \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" and its origins. It discusses the story of Bohemian King Wenceslas I, upon which the carol is based, as well as the tune \\"Tempus adest floridum\\" from the Finnish songbook Piae Cantiones. The text also mentions Jaakko Suomalainen and Theodoric Petri, who were involved in compiling and publishing the Piae Cantiones, and John Mason Neale and Thomas Helmore, who translated some of the carols and introduced them to England through their published collections."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The statement implies that there are still remains of the historic castle present that allow it to overlook the town. Kendal Castle is a significant historical site located in Kendal, Cumbria, England. It is believed that the castle was built in the late 12th century, serving as an important stronghold and residence for local nobility, including the barons of Kendal. Over the centuries, the castle has experienced natural deterioration, damage from weather, and the passage of time, leading to the current state of ruins. However, the phrase \\"overlook the town\\" signifies that there are sufficient remnants of the castle structure remaining to be visible from the town and perhaps even offering a vantage point to look over the town. This contradicts the hypothesis that states the remains of Kendal Castle are completely gone. In conclusion, the premise provided strongly indicates that some parts of Kendal Castle are still in existence, even if only as ruins.

Washington (CNN) -- Republican leaders will propose cutting more spending to balance the amount of additional disaster relief money in a short-term government spending measure defeated earlier by the House, two Republican sources told CNN on Thursday. The additional spending cut, called an offset, would be roughly 100 million from a Department of Energy loan program linked to the solar panel firm Solyndra, which recently collapsed, said the sources -- a GOP aide and a Republican member of Congress -- who spoke on condition of not being identified. The plan, which faces sharp Democratic opposition, could pave the way for a partial government shutdown when the current fiscal year ends on September 30 if it is not resolved. This time, the speaker threatened members with pulling them from committee assignments if they failed to support the continuing resolution on Wednesday, according to a Republican source who attended the","output":"meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity. The new proposal, with the added spending cuts, is expected to gain more support from conservative Republicans who previously opposed the initial bill. Democrats, however, argue the additional cuts are unnecessary and could hurt the nation's already struggling clean energy industry. They claim the offsets are simply a political move by Republicans attempting to capitalize on the Solyndra scandal, which has become an emblem of failed government investments in green technology. As September 30 approaches, both parties continue to blame each other for the impending shutdown. Republican leaders insist on their demand for more spending cuts, while Democrats point out that the disaster relief aid should not be held hostage to partisan wrangling. In a last-minute effort to avert a government shutdown, several members of both parties come together behind closed doors to negotiate an agreement. The compromise includes a smaller offset than initially proposed by the Republicans, which focuses only on wasteful spending within the Department of Energy loan program, while preserving funding for other vital clean energy initiatives. The bipartisan deal is reached just hours before the deadline, averting a potentially disastrous government shutdown. The House quickly passes the compromise bill, followed by approval in the Senate and the president's signature. Disaster relief aid is provided with minimal delays, allowing affected communities to start rebuilding. Funding for the clean energy sector is maintained, but with increased scrutiny and oversight to prevent future Solyndra-like situations. While the immediate crisis is averted, the last-minute compromise only serves as a temporary solution to the long-standing disagreement between Republicans and Democrats on government spending. Both parties declare victory to their constituents: Republicans claim they successfully pressured Democrats to address wasteful spending and be more fiscally responsible, while Democrats argue they successfully pushed back against harmful Republican austerity measures and defended important clean energy initiatives. However, this victory is short-lived, as the fundamental disagreement between the two parties on spending priorities, debt, and economic policy only deepens the political divide between them. As the nation moves closer to the next fiscal year, new battles over the budget and spending priorities loom on the horizon, threatening to repeat the cycle of brinkmanship and last-minute deals. In conclusion, the story ends with a temporary compromise, which averts a government shutdown and provides disaster relief funding. Nonetheless, the underlying issues of partisan disagreements on spending, debt, and economic policy remain unresolved, setting the stage for future confrontations between the two parties. While this particular situation was diffused, it serves as yet another reminder of the deep ideological divide in American politics and the challenges faced in bridging that divide for the good of the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Desperate to prove himself to Darcy and Dan, Nick attempts to think of copy for a series of feminine products that Darcy distributed at the day's staff meeting. He slips and falls into his bathtub while holding an electric hairdryer, shocking himself. The next day, Nick wakes up and comes to realize that he can hear the innermost thoughts of all women. This proves to be an epiphany for him as he realizes that most women, especially at work, dislike him and consider him to be sleazy. When he goes to his old divorce therapist, Dr. Perkins (who also disliked him), she realizes his gift and encourages him to learn to use it to his advantage. Nick eavesdrops on Darcy and sabotages her ideas to use as his own. As he spends more time with Darcy, he realizes he is attracted to her.

In the US presidential election of 1916, Paul and the NWP campaigned in western states where women could already vote against the continuing refusal of President Woodrow Wilson and other incumbent Democrats to actively support the Suffrage Amendment. In January 1917, the NWP staged the first political protest and picketing at the White House. The pickets, participating in a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign known as the \\"Silent Sentinels,\\" held banners demanding the right to vote.  After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, many people viewed the picketing Silent Sentinels as disloyal. In June 1917, picketers were arrested on charges of \\"obstructing traffic.\\" Over the next six months, many, including Alice, were convicted and incarcerated at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia (which later became the Lorton Correctional Complex) and the District of Columbia Jail.  When the public heard the news of the first arrests some were surprised that leading suffragists and very well-connected women were going to prison for peacefully protesting. President Wilson received bad publicity from this event, and was livid with the position he was forced into. He quickly pardoned the first women arrested on July 19, two days after they had been sentenced, but reporting on the arrests and abuses continued. The Boston Journal, for example, stated, \\"The little band representing the NWP has been abused and bruised by government clerks, soldiers and sailors until its efforts to attract the President's attention has sunk into the conscience of the whole nation.\\"  Suffragists continued picketing outside the White House after the Wilson pardon, and throughout World War I. Their banners contained such slogans as \\"Mr. President, How Long Must Women Wait For Liberty?\\". Although the suffragists protested peacefully, their protests were sometimes violently opposed. While protesting, young men would harass and beat the women, with the police never intervening on behalf of the protesters. Police would even arrest other men who tried to help the women who were getting beaten. Even though they were protesting during wartime, they maintained public support by agitating peacefully. Throughout this time, more protesters were arrested and sent to Occoquan or the District Jail. Pardons were no longer offered. Answer this question \\"what are silent sentenials?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Silent Sentinels were the first political protestors and picketers at the White House, participating in a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign for women's suffrage.

The Simpsons Movie is a 2007 American animated comedy film based on the Fox television series The Simpsons. The film was directed by David Silverman, and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell and Russi Taylor, with Tom Hanks, Green Day and Albert Brooks in guest roles. The film follows Homer Simpson, whose irresponsibility gets the best of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up following receipt of a warning from the Environmental Protection Agency. As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, when he intends to destroy Springfield. 20th Century Fox announced on April 1, 2006 that the film would be released worldwide on July 27, 2007. The film was released a day earlier in Australia and the United Kingdom. Little information about the plot was released in the weeks building up to the film's release. Groening did not feel that \\"people look in the TV section of the newspaper and think, 'I'll watch this week's Simpsons because I like the plot.'

Each Springfield produced a film, explaining why their town should host the premiere, with the results being decided via a vote on the USA Today website. Springfield, Minnesota dropped out on May 31, 2007. The winner was announced on July 10 to be Springfield, Vermont. The town beat Springfield, Illinois by 15,367 votes to 14,634. Each of the other 14 entrants held their own smaller screenings of the film on July 26. Springfield, Vermont hosted the world premiere of the film on July 21 with a yellow carpet instead of the traditional red.  The film was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \\"irreverent humor throughout\\". The production staff had expected this rating.

This statement implies that the speaker or group the speaker represents has been under significant influence or pressure from lobbyists, whether these are individuals, organizations, or corporations seeking to advance their own interests. Lobbying is a common practice in political and business arenas where entities strive to sway the decision-making process in their favor.  Often lobbyists use persuasion, information, or other means to influence those in a position to make decisions. This influence can be positive or negative. Positive lobbying can serve to highlight areas of collective concern, bringing important issues to the forefront of our attention that need to be addressed. But on the negative side, lobbying can sometimes exert undue influence and benefit a select few at the expense of the majority.  Saying \\"if such proof was needed\\" infers that for the speaker, the fact they're lobbying in the first place demonstrates their inherent influence and possibly the imbalances associated with it. Still, they seem to acknowledge that others might require more tangible, concrete evidence to be convinced of the lobbyists' impact.  The mention of the group being \\"subjected\\" to this lobbying could indicate a sense of victimization or being unfairly targeted. It's as if they're on the receiving end of an unwelcome or unjust exercise of power or pressure. The severity and implication of this situation would greatly depend on the context of the lobbying, the interests at stake, the power dynamics involved, and the consequences endured by the group.

Constipation is not a glamorous topic, but it’s certainly important, especially in older adults. As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.

She is the 2010 Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World champion (2008, 2010, 2014), a three-time Four Continents champion (2008, 2010, 2013), and a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2005-06, 2008-09, 2012-13, 2013-14). She is the only female figure skater who has landed three triple Axel jumps in one competition, which she achieved at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Asada moved from Japan to the United States in August 2006 to train with Rafael Arutyunyan in Lake Arrowhead, California. There she was able to escape the overcrowding of Japanese rinks and the pressure of the Japanese media.  At her first event, the 2006 Skate America, Asada won the bronze medal behind Miki Ando and Kimmie Meissner. Asada had won the short program, but was fourth in the free skating, finishing with a total score 171.23 points. She was 21.36 points out of first place. Asada won her second event, the 2006 NHK Trophy with 199.52 points, setting the highest combined score in a Ladies' competition under the ISU Judging System and consequently, a world record. Her margin of victory was 20.21 points ahead of silver medalist Fumie Suguri. Asada went into the 2006-07 Grand Prix Final as the reigning champion. She placed second with 172.52 points, 11.68 behind gold medalist Yuna Kim. Asada had won the short program, but placed fourth in the free skating.  Asada won the 2006-07 Japan Championships by 26.11 points ahead of silver medalist Miki Ando. At the 2007 Worlds Championships, Asada was fifth in the short program, 10.03 points behind Yuna Kim, who placed first in that section of the competition with a score of 71.95 points, setting a new world record for the highest short program score. Asada won the free skating with a score of 133.13 points, setting a new world record for the highest free skating score, a record which stood for eight months. During her free skating, she successfully landed a triple axel, a triple flip-triple loop combination, a double axel, a triple lutz, a triple flip, and a triple lutz-double loop-double loop combination but under-rotated the second jump of a double axel-triple toe loop combination.

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Movie title: Red Riding Hood Movie plot: Set during a cold winter in a snow-covered forest during an undeterminate year of the Medivel times, Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) is a young woman living in the small village of Daggerhorn. She is in love with the woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), but her parents Cesaire (Billy Burke) and Suzette (Virginia Madsen) have promised wealthy blacksmith Adrian Lazar (Michael Shanks) that Valerie will marry his son Henry (Max Irons) hoping Valerie will marry into wealth so she and they can live off Lazar's money.Valerie plans to run away with Peter, but their plans are put on hold when the town sirens erupt, telling the couple that the werewolf who terrorizes their village has struck again. On closer inspection of the victim (found among a field of haystacks), it is found to be Lucy, Valerie's older sister. The townspeople offer a monthly sacrifice to the beast and stay away from the woods but Lucy ventured there after discovering that Valerie had been promised in engagement to Henry, whom Lucy loved.Adrian, Henry, Peter, Cesaire, and the other men venture out into the woods to a mountain cave hunt the Wolf. Against Henry's protest, the group splits into two groups and Henry and his father are attacked. The others manage to behead the wolf, but it kills Adrian in the process. The men bring back the head of a common gray wolf, thinking it is the one that has been terrorizing the village.Valerie sees Suzette crying over Adrian's body and confronts her. Suzette admits that she and Adrian once had an affair and that Lucy is actually his daughter as well as Henry's half-sister. This is the reason why she could not be offered to him. Valerie also learns that Cesaire is seemingly unaware of this.The townspeople decide to celebrate the death of the wolf, but their preparations are interrupted by the arrival of famous witch hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), who reveals that the townspeople did not slaughter the real Wolf because it would have changed back into its human form if they did. Solomon knows this because he... Answer:","output":"In the movie Red Riding Hood, it is not explicitly mentioned who takes Valerie to the church. However, given the context and the setting of the film, it is likely that her family, including her parents Cesaire and Suzette, would accompany her to the church for various events and gatherings, especially considering the close-knit nature of the small village of Daggerhorn. The movie's plot revolves around the love triangle between Valerie, Peter, and Henry, set against the backdrop of a village terrorized by a werewolf. In the midst of these complicated relationships and the looming threat of the werewolf, the villagers turn to their faith and community for support and guidance. During the course of the movie, the village seeks the help of Father Solomon, a renowned witch hunter, to deal with the werewolf problem. This situation would have inevitably led Valerie and other villagers to interact with him and attend the church where he presided over various events and ceremonies. While we cannot confirm who exactly takes Valerie to the church, it can be inferred that her family members, including her parents, would play a significant role in accompanying her when the need arises. In conclusion, the movie Red Riding Hood does not provide a direct answer to the question of who takes Valerie to the church. However, considering the social dynamics of the village and the involvement of her family in her life, it can be reasonably assumed that her parents or other family members would accompany her when necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is unhappily married to a temperamental producer? ?  Former model Maria Wyeth, who comes from a Nevada town with a population of 28, is now a successful actress. But she is unhappily married to, and separated from, temperamental producer Carter Lang and also chronically depressed and institutionalized. Reflecting back on what brought her here, Maria recalls driving around Los Angeles in her yellow Chevrolet Corvette and spending time with her closest friend, B.Z. Mendenhall, an unhappy man who is gay. Maria has a brain-damaged daughter, Kate, who is being kept in a sanitarium at the insistence of Carter, who resents Maria visiting the girl so frequently. Maria's secret desire is to live somewhere with Kate and find some kind of joy in life together. Maria has been having an affair with Les Goodwin, a screenwriter. When she tells Carter she is pregnant, he demands she get an abortion. Maria goes to Las Vegas and has a fling with a mob-connected lawyer, Larry Kulik, and later returns to L.A. and has a one-night stand with Johnny Waters, a television star who needs to watch his own show on TV to get in the mood. Bored and depressed, Maria steals Johnny's car and speeds off. When she is stopped by police, drugs are found in the car and she is placed under arrest. Her spirits at an all-time low, Maria returns to Las Vegas and finds that B.Z. is equally unhappy. When he swallows a handful of pills and washes them down with vodka, rather than call for help, Maria cradles him and watches him die. Back at her institution, a psychiatrist asks why she keeps on playing, when knowing what 'nothing' (nihilism) means.

They determined that the most likely source of the problem was an island off the coast, where a series of strange seismic events and weather anomalies had been reported over the past few days. Armed with this information, Traiven, Shawn, and Joker set out on a reconnaissance mission to the island. They traveled by air, flying over the island in a stealth helicopter, equipped with advanced surveillance systems that allowed them to monitor the situation from a safe distance. As they approached the island, they noticed that the strange events appeared to be centered around a remote area, which was home to an abandoned research facility. They decided to focus their attention on this location, hoping to uncover clues about what was causing the mysterious events. As they explored the facility, they discovered that it had once been used to study kaiju and their incredible powers. Piecing together the information they found, they realized that the facility had been running experiments on a captured kaiju, hoping to harness its energy for military purposes. However, it seemed that the experiment had gone awry, and the kaiju had escaped, wreaking havoc on the island. Knowing the stakes had just been raised, the team decided to press on in their mission to stop the kaiju, even though they knew they were not fully prepared to battle such a powerful foe. They tracked the creature to a densely forested area of the island, where they found evidence of its destructive path. Realizing that the kaiju was growing increasingly dangerous, Traiven and Shawn began to devise a plan to stop the creature before it could cause any more harm. With Joker's help, they pieced together a plan that involved using the island's terrain and their own expert combat skills to their advantage, in hopes of capturing and neutralizing the kaiju. The intense battle that ensued tested the limits of their abilities, as Traiven, Shawn, and Joker fought the kaiju with every ounce of strength and skill they possessed. Despite the odds being stacked against them, they persevered, relying on their training and teamwork to gradually weaken the kaiju. Finally, after a grueling struggle, the team managed to subdue the creature and neutralize the threat it posed. Exhausted but victorious, Traiven, Shawn, and Joker contacted General Shinnle to report the successful completion of their mission. The experience had proved to them that, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges, they were capable of overcoming obstacles and achieving their objectives. General Shinnle praised the trio for their bravery and resourcefulness, and expressed his gratitude for their efforts in preventing further harm to innocent lives. In the aftermath of the mission, the team continued to hone their skills and took on new challenges, knowing that they would always be stronger together. Their victory against the kaiju solidified their bond, and they became a formidable force in the fight against future threats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

None of the women reported the messages to police, as the messages are not considered illegal in Australia, reports The Age. Daniel, 28, asked several women on OKCupid if they have 'ever been offered money', before naming prices and urging them to consider the offer.

Daniel, who uses the account names dja86dj and daniel86dja, has since deleted the offending OKCupid account. In all of the proposals towards Melbourne based women, Daniel offered 500 then raised the sum to 1000 then 2000. One of the women said he had been messaging her intermittently from different accounts for years. However, none of the women who were messaged by Daniel reported him to police. Daniel is seen urging the women to consider his offer of money for sex. Daniel, who uses the account names dja86dj and daniel86dja, has since deleted the offending OKCupid account. A police spokesperson said that no offence had been committed in the messages: in Australia, it is legal to offer money for sex.

What is the worst relationship you've ever been in?","output":"No, the following two questions are not the same, although they may appear to be related to similar aspects of personal experiences. Let's examine each question more closely to understand the differences between them: 1. What was the worst date you've ever been on? This question is specifically asking about a particular date or a single meeting between two people who are exploring or pursuing a romantic or a potential romantic connection. A date generally represents a chance for two individuals to get to know each other better, engage in a shared activity, or spend time together in order to determine whether there might be compatibility for a potential deeper relationship. Dates usually involve one-off events or experiences that can potentially leave positive or negative impressions. People may have several bad dates over time, as the dating process is often about trial and error to find the right partner. In this context, the question is asking for the worst experience someone has encountered during a single date. Factors determining a \\"worst\\" date could include mismatches in personalities, unmet expectations, offensive or inappropriate behaviors, lack of chemistry, a boring or awkward conversation, or an unsatisfactory activity or location for the date. When answering this question, someone may recount an anecdote or story that describes the particular circumstances or events that led to their categorization of the date as the \\"worst.\\" 2. What is the worst relationship you've ever been in? A relationship consists of an ongoing romantic, emotional, or intimate connection between two people. Relationships occur when two individuals develop a mutual bond beyond an initial date or meeting and both parties agree to engage in a deeper partnership, investing time, energy, and emotions into nurturing and maintaining the bond. Relationships can last weeks, months, or years, and can involve varying levels of commitment and emotional investment. When asking about the worst relationship someone has ever been in, the question delves into a broader scope of personal experiences, considering the overall quality and duration of a partnership. Factors that contribute to a \\"worst\\" relationship can be numerous and multifaceted, potentially including communication issues, incompatibility, negativity, lack of trust, dishonesty, infidelity, abuse (emotional or physical), or simply a decline in emotional connection over time. Answering this question, individuals would reflect on their past relationships and choose the one that had the most negative impact on their overall well-being or happiness, possibly sharing specific situations or patterns that occurred within that partnership. In conclusion, while both of these questions pertain to romantic experiences, they differ significantly in scope and context. The first question focuses on a singular, isolated event (a specific date), while the second question involves a broad evaluation of an entire relationship. Both questions solicit personal stories or experiences; however, they prompt different aspects of one's romantic history to be examined and shared."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea.  But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

En français, la phrase ci-dessus est rendue de la manière suivante :  Daté au bureau du Ministre, ce 17ème jour de mars 2004. Lors de la traduction d'une date en français depuis l'anglais, il est important de garder à l'esprit les différences de format entre les deux langues. Dans l'exemple donné, l'anglais utilise « 17th day of March » pour représenter le jour, tandis que le français utilise généralement une forme plus simple en utilisant simplement le numéro du jour suivi du mois, comme dans « 17 mars ». Cependant, pour une traduction plus littérale, on peut dire « 17ème jour de mars ». Il est également important de noter que les mois en français sont généralement écrits en minuscules, alors qu'en anglais, ils sont souvent écrits avec une majuscule initiale. Ainsi, il convient d'écrire « mars » avec une minuscule en français. En outre, considérez que la préposition « de » est utilisée en français pour indiquer l'année, et non « of » comme en anglais. Par conséquent, la traduction correcte serait « 17ème jour de mars 2004 ».

When you hold two magnets far away what is the force between them Strong or Weak? Answer:","output":"As the distance between the objects increases, the magnetic force of attraction between them decreases. This phenomenon is governed by the inverse square law, which implies that the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it can be represented as: F = (k * |m1 * m2|) / d^2 Where: - F represents the magnetic force between the two magnets - k is a constant of proportionality - m1 and m2 are the magnitudes of the magnetic moments of the two magnets - d is the distance between the magnets When you hold two magnets far away from each other, the distance (d) between them becomes relatively large. As the distance in the denominator increases, the overall force F decreases according to the inverse square law. This means that as the distance between the two magnets increases, the magnetic force of attraction between them becomes weaker. Therefore, when you hold two magnets far away from each other, the force between them is weak. This weak force might not be enough to produce any noticeable attraction or effect, especially in the presence of external influences such as gravity, friction, or other nearby magnetic sources. However, as you bring the two magnets closer to each other, the magnetic force between them will increase and become significantly stronger, leading to a much more noticeable attraction or repulsion between the magnets, depending on their orientation. In summary, the magnetic force between two magnets is dependent on the distance between them, with the force becoming weaker as the distance increases. Consequently, when holding two magnets far away from each other, the force between them is weak."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Stockings are smaller than a tissue. Let's analyze the statements step-by-step and justify the steps: Step 1: Assessing the size comparison provided in the statements. - The statement [1] compares the size of stockings to a computer. Generally, it is true that stockings are smaller than most computers. - The statement [2] compares the size of stockings to a tissue. This comparison is inconsistent - as tissues, when unfolded or folded, are smaller than or could be similar to the size of stockings; they are not larger than stockings. Step 2: Determine which statement is more relevant to the goal. - Since the goal is to obtain stockings, a comparison of sizes with a tissue or a computer doesn't necessarily help accomplish this goal. However, understanding the size of stockings can be important when it comes to storage, fitting, or organizing them with other items. Step 3: Choose the statement that makes more sense for the given goal. - Considering the analysis in step 1 and step 2, statement [1] makes more sense because the size comparison is more accurate. Also, understanding that stockings are smaller than a computer might assist in the organization or storage of stockings within a reasonable and practical space.

Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.  - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area.  - Mek We Dweet is a studio album by Jamaican reggae singer Burning Spear . It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album at the 33rd Grammy Awards in 1991 .  - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it.  - Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and the honoring of God, called Jah by Rastafari. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa.  - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938  November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle.  - Winston Rodney OD (born 1 March 1945), better known by the stage name Burning Spear, is a Jamaican roots reggae singer and musician. Burning Spear is a Rastafarian and one of the most influential and long-standing roots artists to emerge from the 1970s.  - Mento is a style of Jamaican folk music that predates and has greatly influenced ska and reggae music. Mento typically features acoustic instruments, such as acoustic guitar, banjo, hand drums, and the rhumba box  a large mbira in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The rhumba box carries the bass part of the music.  - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: When did the narrator start her self-portrait? Options:  A. not enough information  B.

UPDATED:. 08:06 EST, 31 October 2012. A motorcyclist badly injured in a crash had to be driven to hospital by his brother after ambulances sent to get him were diverted nine times. David Pinion, 24, lay in agony for 90 minutes after suffering extensive internal bruising in the crash as a paramedic at the scene desperately tried to organise an ambulance. But the paramedic was eventually told that the ambulances en route had to be diverted to 'more serious' incidents nine times and it would be best if the patient made his own way to the hospital. Crash scene: David Pinion, 24, lying at the side of road underneath. blankets while his brother tries to help him up to take him to the. hospital. It is unclear how many ambulances had been dispatched. Mr Pinion, whose waist had ballooned from 42in to 48in because of the swelling, was forced to ask the paramedic to call his brother to pick him up from the scene of the accident in Ely, Cambridge on October 14. The injured biker then had to be lifted off the road by his brother Robert and friend Chris Boon who drove him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Mr Pinion also suffered damage to his pelvis and ankle and was given morphine by hospital staff to ease his pain. Mr Pinion, from Prickwillow, Cambridge,said: 'The rapid response paramedic who got to me first was brilliant. 'She couldn't have done any more for me, but the people on the radio said they couldn't get an ambulance to me. 'They kept diverting them to more incidents because I was deemed not serious enough. 'Busy time': Ambulances sent to the scene were diverted nine times to 'more serious' incidents. 'The paramedic was arguing with them and. telling them I could have been bleeding internally but they just said. they were sorry and there was nothing they could do. 'Fortunately I didn't suffer any broken bones but I was in so much pain that I really wouldn't want to know what a broken bone feels like.' But Mr Pinion's angry family called for improvements to the ambulance service before lives are lost by delayed response times. Mr Pinion's mother Vanessa said: 'Does someone have to die before we have a decent, reliable ambulance service with a reasonable response time?' An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'This incident has already been raised by the Trust for investigation because the wait for transport to hospital was not acceptable. 'The patient was assessed on-scene by a paramedic, who arrived within six minutes, as not being in a life-threatening condition and during this exceptionally busy time all ambulances which became available had to be diverted to life-threatening calls.'

In the first sentence, \\"Magnolias belong to the division Magnoliophyta,\\" the term \\"division\\" is used in a biological or taxonomical context. In biology, division refers to a rank or category in the classification hierarchy, especially in the classification of plants and fungi. In this classification system, divisions are often considered equivalent to phyla in the animal kingdom. The division Magnoliophyta includes all flowering plants, and magnolias are members of this group.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device When his side lost so meekly in Slovakia last month, the sense was that Strachan would recognise that the relationship between him and his players had run its course. Scotland performed with more gusto against England last week and it is clear that the players who are selected in the squads are still committed to the manager. But, by his own admission, they are all delivering 100% in every training session and game - yet the results have still been poor. How then could Strachan turn the team's fortunes around? It was that realisation that led to the view that he would surely stand down or be dismissed, an outcome that sections of the support would have welcomed. Sacking him would have cost the Scottish FA in compensation, when the qualifying campaign is already approaching a lost cause, but its board did not take that decision. Instead, Strachan has to turn around the team's form when they next play in March - and also public opinion. The head coach is now under more pressure than ever. He insists he can still steer Scotland to a World Cup qualifying play-off spot. To do that, his side need to finish second in Group F, with a better points tally (with games against the bottom side discounted) than the runners-up in at least one other group, since only eight of the nine second-placed teams will contest the play-offs. Group E is bottom in the runners-up rankings as it stands, but even reaching second place requires a drastic turnaround in Scotland's fortunes. They have won only one of their opening four games, against Malta, and drawn their home tie against Lithuania. Trips to Slovakia and England delivered two 3-0 losses. The simplest route to second place lies in making the assumption that England win all of their remaining qualifying games, which would repeat their 100% record in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. If Scotland win all of their five remaining games, they will finish on 19 points. If Slovenia lose to England and both games against Scotland, their best points tally would be 17. Assuming the same for Slovakia, their best points tally would be 18. There are other permutations. Slovenia travel to Slovakia in September and if that game is drawn then Scotland could finish second with 17 points, which would require four wins and one draw. In those circumstances, Scotland could potentially make the play-offs by beating Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia at Hampden, winning in Lithuania away and getting a point in Slovenia. Whatever happens, Scotland need to address their own decline first. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Scotland's national football team faces an uphill battle to secure a World Cup qualifying play-off spot after a poor start to their campaign. The team has won only one of its first four games and lies fifth in Group F, raising doubts over coach Gordon Strachan's tenure. To qualify for the play-offs, Scotland must finish second in their group and achieve a better points tally than at least one other second-place team. With five games left to play, beginning in March, the team needs drastic improvements in form to regain momentum and public support."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Question: According to the passage, what are some limitations and criticisms of humanism, and why does Tony Davies argue that it should not be entirely abandoned? Answer: The limitations and criticisms of humanism include its failure to fulfill its emancipatory ideal, highlighted by antihumanists, and controversial views like Heidegger's, who considered humanism only applicable to the Germans and specifically to the Nazis. Tony Davies argues that humanism should not be entirely abandoned because it remains the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution, and provides the freedom to speak, write, organize, and campaign for individual or collective interests."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First Spaniards (Manila galleon) and Portuguese, then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries. The penetration of European commercial interests gradually evolved into annexation of territories, as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities.

Combine facts and answer this: Who wrote the Salford-set 1999 British comedy starring Om Puri that rose to popularity along with Anita and Me? Answer:","output":"The Salford-set 1999 British comedy film starring Om Puri is \\"East is East,\\" which was written by Ayub Khan-Din. \\"East is East\\" is a film adaptation of Khan-Din's critically acclaimed semi-autobiographical play of the same name that premiered in 1996. The story revolves around the Khan family of mixed Pakistani-English ethnicity, living in Manchester, England, in the early 1970s, and the cultural struggles they face. Om Puri, renowned Indian actor, plays the role of George Khan, a Pakistani immigrant still deeply rooted in his traditional values, attempting to raise and enforce his beliefs upon his British-born children. The film brilliantly presents the conflicts the Khan family faces, especially the children, as they try to navigate their lives, torn between two very different cultures. The success of \\"East is East\\" allowed it to reach greater audiences and received several awards and nominations. This popularity eventually spawned a sequel titled \\"West Is West\\" in 2010, continuing the story of the Khan family. \\"Anita and Me\\", on the other hand, is a separate British comedy-drama film released in 2002, based on the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Meera Syal. The story is set in the Midlands during the 1970s and focuses on the coming-of-age experiences of a young British Asian girl named Meena, portrayed by Chandeep Uppal, and her friendship with a neighboring white girl, Anita, played by Anna Brewster. Both \\"East is East\\" and \\"Anita and Me\\" gained popularity due to their nuanced portrayal of the immigrant experience and British Asian identity. They both highlight the complexities of living between two cultures and the challenges faced by the characters as they navigate the cultural divide. While Ayub Khan-Din wrote the screenplay for \\"East is East,\\" it was Tanuja Desai Hidier who took on the responsibility of adapting Meera Syal's novel \\"Anita and Me\\" for the big screen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Chelsea Manning: what kind of treatment can she expect in jail? 'I want everyone to know the real me' … Chelsea Manning. Photograph: Ho/AFP/Getty Images In July last year a prisoner serving a discretionary life sentence for sexual offences was found hanged at Full Sutton, a maximum security men's jail near York. In the months leading up to the hanging, William \\"Billie\\" Evans had been wearing women's clothing and makeup as he became she. Evans was in the process of transitioning into a woman when she died. An inquest has not yet been held into the 44-year-old's death, though a prisoner at the jail told the Guardian she had been subjected to intense bullying and had been moved to a supposedly safer wing of the jail when she was found hanging in her single cell. But we don't need a coroner to confirm that male prisons are pretty macho places, where bullying is rife. Gyms are the most popular recreational facility, and are usually packed with inmates bent on bulking up their already honed torsos. For gay men, prison presents a challenge: abuse is commonplace, and gay men usually develop a thick skin and a readiness to meet mockery head-on. But those trapped in the wrong gender and undergoing change face an entirely different order of challenge. After Bradley Manning was jailed for 35 years this week for leaking a cache of US government secrets, his lawyer, David Coombs, announced that his client wished to be called Chelsea Manning and addressed with the female pronoun. Coombs said Manning was seeking hormone therapy and not a sex-change operation. Some jurisdictions in the US now require facilities to provide hormone therapy to trans inmates as a part of their routine medical care, but Fort Leavenworth, the military installation where Manning is being held, is not currently compelled to do the same. Officials there have made it clear that they will not be providing the required treatment, beyond psychiatric support. No inmates have received sex-reassignment surgery while in US prisons, Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project for Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, told NBC News this week. But a 2010 study by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation identified more than 330 transgender inmates in a population of about 160,000, equal to about 0.2%. The National Center for Transgender Equality in the US estimates that the actual figure may be much higher. The prison service in England and Wales says it does not collate figures of transgender prisoners nationally, with a spokeswoman saying simply that \\"prison staff are required to manage transgendered prisoners in accordance with the law\\". The Scottish Prison Service (SPS), which has a more enlightened policy on trans issues, confirms that in the past year, five prisoners who presented as male when entering the prison system ended up in women's jails, with seven women doing the reverse and ending up in male jails. Currently the Scottish prison population stands at 8,292, (compared with 88,179 in England and Wales), so that is 0.14%. In Scotland transgender inmates are identified as soon as they go to jail, says Tom Fox, head of corporate affairs at the SPS. \\"In all cases, a risk assessment is conducted on arrival at the prison. Thereafter, a multidisciplinary case conference is carried out as soon as possible, [which] will decide on the management of that person. The SPS is developing a policy on gender identity and gender reassignment. Interim guidance developed in conjunction with relevant partners has been issued to staff. The guidance and policy is being developed in partnership with the Transgender Alliance and our legal partners.\\" He is unsure whether any inmates have undergone surgery, but said that the SPS would permit it. Ever since the Gender Recognition Act 2004 came into force, prisons in England and Wales have been forced to accommodate the needs of trans inmates who have received legal acknowledgement of their acquired gender through the issue of a gender recognition certificate. A special prison service order deals with the issue of gender-change prisoners and provides guidance for prison managers and staff. Its main tenet declares establishments must provide prisoners who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria with the same quality of care they would expect to receive from the NHS if they had not been sent to prison. Jails are instructed to permit prisoners undergoing gender reassignment to live permanently in their acquired gender. This includes dressing in appropriate clothing, adopting new names and form of address. The rules differ according to gender; males wishing to transition to females may be refused permission to transfer to a female prison on grounds of security, but female-to-male prisoners may not be refused a transfer, because there are no grounds that can prevent location in the male estate. The position was clarified in a high court judgment in 2009. A pre-operative transgender prisoner at HMP Manchester (formerly Strangeways) asked for a judicial review after being refused a transfer to a female prison on security grounds. The judge, David Elvin QC, ruled that the decision contravened Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordered that the claimant be transferred to a female jail. Experts for the prison service and the claimant successfully argued that the Gender Identity Clinic in London would not approve surgery until she had spent a period living as a woman in a female jail. It followed that as long as she remained in the male estate, she was unable to progress towards surgery. \\"The prison service seems to have confused attitudes,\\" the claimant said in evidence. \\"They will not consider me as a female until I have my penis removed, notwithstanding my gender recognition certificate. Yet they resist moving me to the female estate, which would enable me to have the surgery.\\" The 27-year-old said she had been trying to \\"get this sorted\\" since she was 10. \\"It is frustrating not to be able to progress to the final stage, and I worry it may never happen. I get frustrated, but I try to deal with it on my own. I do cry and let my emotions out, but I do this in the privacy of my cell. It is not something I can discuss with anyone in prison.\\" As for what will happen to Manning, it is far from clear. LGBT groups in the US declare the military's refusal to provide hormone therapy unconstitutional. But change could be on the horizon. Last year a US judge ruled that the State Department of Correction must provide sex-reassignment surgery for Michelle Kosilek, who is serving a life sentence for murder. Massachusetts prison officials have asked a federal appeals court to overturn the ruling. If Kosilek wins, Manning may be able to expect more compassionate treatment, too.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - The Grammy Award for Best Rock Song is an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality songs in the rock music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \\"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\\".  - Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters.  - There Is Nothing Left to Lose is the third studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released November 2, 1999. The album marks the first appearance of drummer Taylor Hawkins, and is often seen as a departure from the band's previous work, showcasing a softer, more experimental sound. In a 2006 interview, Dave Grohl states that the album is \\"totally based on melody\\" and that it \\"might be his favorite album that they've ever done.\\"  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967  April 5, 1994) was an American musician, artist, songwriter, guitarist and poet. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain formed the band Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene and grunge genre. Nirvana's debut album \\"Bleach\\" was released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989.  - \\"Best of You\\" is a song by American alternative rock band Foo Fighters, and the first single released from the band's fifth studio album, \\"In Your Honor\\" (2005). Dave Grohl notes that the song was written following appearances at 2004 American presidential candidate John Kerry's campaign trail and is \\"about breaking away from the things that confine you\\". To date, it is the band's only single to reach Platinum status in the US. The song holds the band's highest chart peaks in the U.S. (#18), the UK (#4), and Australia (#5), and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song won the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. It also topped \\"Billboard\\"'s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for seven weeks. Following the band's performance at Live Earth, the song again entered the UK charts at #38.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - \`\` The Pretender '' is a song by the American alternative rock band Foo Fighters . It was the first single from the group 's 2007 album Echoes , Silence , Patience & Grace .

It is a double album, with one disc containing heavy rock songs and a second disc with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl decided to do a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band had to break new ground with their music. The album was recorded at a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics deal with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election.  - Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music produced independently from major commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term \\"indie\\" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, \\"indie\\" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Kerrang! is a UK-based magazine devoted to rock music, currently published by Hamburg based Bauer Media Group. It was first published on 6 June 1981 as a one-off supplement in the \\"Sounds\\" newspaper. Named after the onomatopoeic word that derives from the sound made when playing a power chord on a distorted electric guitar, \\"Kerrang!\\" was initially devoted to the new wave of British heavy metal and the rise of hard rock acts. In the early 2000s it became the best-selling British music newspaper.    'the pretender ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'record label'?

Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development.

She could not stand to see her friend in pain and felt that it was important to provide some kind of relief. Monica remembered how terrible it felt when she herself experienced cramps during her period and understood the uneasiness Katrina was going through. In that moment, she made a judgement call to help her friend feel better. Their friendship had always been one of understanding and support, and this occasion was no different. Monica thought about the times when they had been there for each other through thick and thin, during happy moments and difficult ones. She knew that, at times like this, it was essential to stand by her friend and make her feel comfortable. She approached Katrina with a kind and gentle smile, trying to gauge her level of discomfort and assess if she was in unbearable pain. Monica carefully handed her a bottle of over-the-counter pain relief medication, explaining that these pills had helped her through many similar situations. She trusted that this simple gesture would alleviate Katrina's discomfort, at least for the time being. Katrina, though initially hesitant to accept the pills due to a moment of pride, soon realized that she could use some help. She felt grateful for Monica's understanding and concern and took the pills with a warm \\"Thank you.\\" As they sat together, waiting for the medicine to take effect, they found solace in each other's company and in the reminder that they were there to support one another. In that moment, what started as a small act of kindness turned into a bonding experience. The girls engaged in light conversation, and Monica made sure to avoid any topic that could stress Katrina further. Periods are a natural and normal part of life for many women, but are often associated with pain and discomfort. Monica's concern and care helped make an uncomfortable situation more manageable for her friend. As time passed and the pain began to subside, Katrina felt grateful not only for the relief that the pain pills had provided, but also for the love and compassion Monica had shown her. Their friendship, built on trust, understanding, and loyalty, had been further enriched by this simple yet meaningful gesture. In conclusion, Monica offered her friend Katrina pain pills because she empathized with Katrina's painful experience caused by menstrual cramps.

Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: If you're about to reach a stop sign in your car what must you do? Possible A: slow down, go fast, roll over, crash, fly  Why is \\"slow down\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Slow down\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Common sense, as a general concept, refers to the innate, practical knowledge that humans possess which allows them to make logical judgments and decisions in a variety of situations. In the context of driving, common sense plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and well-being of all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists. 1. Traffic regulations: One of the primary reasons \\"slow down\\" is aligned with common sense is due to traffic regulations. Stop signs are a standard traffic control device installed to inform drivers that they are required to make a complete stop at a specific point, usually at an intersection. Adhering to traffic rules and regulations promotes order and predictability on the road, making the act of slowing down when approaching a stop sign a common sense action. 2. Safety: Another crucial aspect of common sense is prioritizing safety. Slowing down when approaching a stop sign is the safest course of action to prevent accidents or collisions with other road users. Coming to a complete stop allows the driver to assess the situation, check for cross traffic or pedestrians, and proceed only when it is safe to do so. Adopting a common sense approach and slowing down at stop signs contributes to overall road safety. 3. Responsibility: As a responsible driver, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and hazards on the road. Failing to slow down at a stop sign can lead to accidents, penalties, or legal consequences. As a sign of respect for fellow road users and a commitment to adhering to the rules of the road, slowing down at a stop sign demonstrates responsible behavior informed by common sense. 4. Collision avoidance: As a driver, one of the fundamental common sense principles is to avoid potential collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. Slowing down when approaching a stop sign ensures that the driver has sufficient time to react, assess the situation, and avoid any potential dangers. In contrast to the other possible answers provided, such as \\"go fast,\\" \\"roll over,\\" \\"crash,\\" and \\"fly,\\" \\"slow down\\" is the clear choice based on common sense. These alternative responses do not contribute to good decision-making, as they either defy the laws of physics, like \\"fly,\\" or actively encourage behavior that would significantly increase the risk of harm, like \\"go fast,\\" \\"roll over,\\" or \\"crash.\\" In summary, \\"slow down\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it adheres to traffic regulations, promotes safety, demonstrates responsibility, and helps avoid collisions. Choosing to slow down when approaching a stop sign not only prevents accidents but also fosters a safer and more predictable driving environment for all road users."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the condition (ABC is not busy being part of the problem) were met, the result (it would have been a good story for ABC News) would happen. The hypothesis is also a counterfactual conditional statement. If the condition (ABC news had not incited the terrorist) were met, the result (there would have been no story) would happen. Step 3: Check for entailment with the given counterfactual conditionals An entailment exists if the truth of one statement (A) guarantees the truth of another statement (B). In this case, the truth of the premise would need to guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Now let's examine the premise and hypothesis. The premise states that if ABC News wasn't part of the problem, then it would have been a good story for them. The hypothesis states that if ABC News hadn't incited the terrorist, there would have been no story. Step 4: Assess if the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis The conditions of the premise and the hypothesis are different (being part of the problem vs. inciting the terrorist), so it's unclear if one guarantees the truth of the other. Also, the outcome in the premise (a good story for ABC News) is not the same as the outcome in the hypothesis (no story at all), which indicates that these statements don't entail each other. Conclusion: The given premise does not entail the given hypothesis. While there may be some relationship between ABC News being part of the problem and inciting the terrorist, the information given doesn't allow us to determine that one statement guarantees the truth of the other."},{"instruction":"Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Sic.

Lewis Robert \\"Hack\\" Wilson (April 26, 1900 - November 23, 1948) was an American Major League Baseball player who played 12 seasons for the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. Despite his diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s. His 1930 season with the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season hitting performances in baseball history. Highlights included 56 home runs, the National League record for 68 years; and 191 runs batted in, a mark yet to be surpassed. \\" Wilson made his major league debut with the Giants on September 29, 1923 and became the starting left fielder the following season. By mid-July he was ranked second in the National League (NL) in hitting. He ended the season with a .295 average, 10 home runs, and 57 runs batted in (RBIs) as New York won the NL pennant. In the 1924 World Series he averaged only .233 in a seven-game loss to the Washington Senators.  Multiple stories exist to explain the origin of Wilson's nickname: By one account, a New York newspaper held a nicknaming contest; the winning entry was \\"Hack\\" because he reminded many fans of another stocky athlete, the popular wrestler Georg Hackenschmidt. In another version, McGraw is said to have remarked that Wilson's physique was reminiscent of a \\"hack\\" (slang for taxicab in that era). Giants teammate Bill Cunningham claimed that the nickname was based on Wilson's resemblance to Hack Miller, an outfielder with the Chicago Cubs. The New York Times printed the first documented usage of \\"Hack\\" on June 10, 1924.  Early in the 1925 season Wilson hit the longest home run on record at Ebbets Field against the Brooklyn Robins, but fell into a slump in May, and was replaced in left field by Irish Meusel. On July 2 he hit two home runs in one inning, tying Ken Williams' major league record set in 1922, but his hitting slump continued. In August McGraw told reporters that he had \\"...made the mistake of rushing [Wilson] along,\\" and sent him to the Giants' minor league affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. At season's end, a front office oversight--or possibly, deliberate inaction--left him unprotected on the Toledo roster, and the last-place Chicago Cubs acquired him on waivers. \\"They let go the best outfielder I ever played alongside\\", said Giants right fielder Ross Youngs, \\"and they're going to regret it.\\"  During the 1925 World Series -- between the Senators and the Pittsburgh Pirates -- Wilson's son, Robert, was born. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article and Hack Wilson's life and career: 1. Hack Wilson's physical attributes: Standing at only 5 feet 6 inches and weighing around 190 pounds, Wilson's powerful build and short legs were unusual for an outfielder. However, his large arms, broad shoulders, and powerful upper body allowed him to generate an impressive amount of power for his size, which contributed to his success as a hitter. 2. Record-breaking 1930 season with the Cubs: Wilson had a phenomenal season in 1930, posting incredible numbers that still hold significance in baseball history. He hit 56 home runs, which remained the National League record until 1998 when it was surpassed by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. More notably, Wilson set the all-time MLB record for runs batted in (RBIs) with 191, a record that still stands today. 3. Alcoholism and personal struggles: Hack Wilson's life was not without its challenges, as he battled alcoholism throughout his career and life. His drinking led to issues with management, and he was even traded several times due to this behavior. Sadly, his addiction ultimately led to a downward spiral in his career and contributed to his early death at the age of 48. 4. Post-career and Hall of Fame induction: Wilson's post-baseball life was marked by financial struggles, failed business endeavors, and alcoholism. However, his remarkable career was finally recognized when he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979, more than 30 years after his death. 5. Legacy: Despite his tumultuous personal life, Wilson's outstanding baseball accomplishments still make him a notable figure in the sport's history. He was known for his powerful swing and ability to hit the ball out of the park, as well as for his unforgettable record-setting 1930 season. Hack Wilson's legacy serves as both a testament to his incredible talent and a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of personal struggles, such as substance abuse, in the lives of professional athletes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kasim Ahmed has pleaded guilty.","output":"Title: \\"Tragic End for IT Aspirant: Victim of Senseless Crime\\" In a shocking turn of events, Thavisha Lakindu Peiris, a promising young Sri Lankan, was brutally knifed to death in his car for his phone, as reported in a recent court hearing. The quiet and gentle 25-year-old was on the verge of starting a new career in Information Technology (IT) when his life was tragically cut short due to the senseless act of violence. An unfortunate chain of events led to Thavisha's untimely demise. He was working his last shift at his part-time job and was about to clock off. However, he was persuaded to take one final delivery before finishing his day. Little did he know that this seemingly innocuous decision would result in an appalling and life-changing encounter. While on his last delivery, Thavisha was brutally attacked for his phone, a motive which highlights the tragic prevalence of crime and violence dominating today's society. Thavisha, a hard-working, ambitious, and gentle young man, had moved from Sri Lanka to pursue a promising career in the IT industry. His life and the hopes of his family were shattered when the defendants, Shamraze Khan and Kasim Ahmed, callously targeted him. During the court proceedings, it was revealed that Shamraze Khan had been charged with Thavisha's murder. On the other hand, Kasim Ahmed pleaded guilty to the heinous crime, accepting full responsibility for his appalling actions. Both defendants now face the specter of justice for their cold-blooded actions that ended an innocent young man's life. Thavisha's murder brings to light the harrowing dangers faced by individuals engaging in seemingly safe tasks, such as making deliveries for occupations that are traditionally viewed as low-risk. His death highlights the pressing need for greater safety measures for employees in these sectors, as well as a renewed focus on addressing crime and violence in our communities. The senseless murder of Thavisha Lakindu Peiris has sent ripples of shock and sorrow throughout the community. His family, friends, and colleagues are grappling with the traumatic reality of losing someone so young and full of potential. Thavisha's story underscores the critical importance of addressing the systemic issues of crime, violence, and the need for preventive safety measures to ensure that such a tragedy does not befall another innocent person. As our society grapples with pervasive crime and violence, it is essential that we take meaningful action to implement strategies to curb these alarming trends. We need to invest in community-based initiatives, education, and law enforcement efforts to combat the root causes of crime and prevent needless acts of violence, like Thavisha's murder, from recurring. In conclusion, the immeasurable loss of Thavisha Lakindu Peiris serves as a stark reminder of the urgency to address the societal issues surrounding crime and violence. Moving forward, it is the responsibility of our communities and institutions to implement comprehensive action plans to prevent future tragedies such as this and to create a safer world where talented, hard-working individuals like Thavisha can realize their dreams and achieve their fullest potential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them.  Would trail B be shorter or longer than trail A?  Hint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to... Answer:","output":"In this scenario, it is likely that trail B would be longer than trail A. Since ants communicate using pheromones and are able to detect the shortest and most efficient route to a food source by reinforcing the pheromone trail, the trail with the most ants (trail A) would indicate that it is the most efficient path. When a food source is found, ants mark the trail on their way back to the colony, and other ants follow and reinforce this trail. As more ants use the trail, the pheromone scent becomes stronger, signaling to other ants that it is the optimal path. When the food source is exhausted, ants stop marking the route, allowing the scent to dissipate slowly. On the other hand, trail B was abandoned, suggesting that it was not the shortest or most efficient route to a food source. The ants would have explored other routes (including trail A) and determined that trail B was not the best option. Consequently, fewer ants marked and reinforced trail B, causing the pheromone scent to diminish and ants to stop using that trail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we're going to learn about preparing threads! Threads can be used for many things like sewing, making friendship bracelets, or even creating little projects with your family, like making decorations for your room. But first, we need to get our thread ready. Let's begin! 1. Choosing the Thread The first thing we have to do is choose the right thread. Let's think of this as picking your favorite flavor of ice-cream. Just like there are many flavors, there are many colors of thread. Pick a color that you love! 2. Measuring the Thread Now that you've picked your favorite color, it's time to measure how much thread we need. Ask a grown-up to help you with this part. Using a ruler, decide how long you want your thread to be and then ask your grown-up friend to cut it. Maybe the length you need is as long as your favorite toy or as short as the length of your hand. 3. Untangling the Thread Sometimes threads can get tangled, just like the shoelaces on your shoes. To untangle the thread, hold one end with your fingertips and use the other hand to gently brush the thread, just like you would with your hair. If it's too tangled, ask for help from a grown-up. 4. Threading the Needle Now let's get our needle ready for sewing or crafting! Carefully put one end of the thread through the needle's tiny hole called the \\"eye of the needle.\\" It might be a little tricky, but with practice, you can do it. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask a grown-up. Remember, needles can be sharp, so be very careful! 5. Tying a Knot To make sure our thread stays in place when we're sewing or making our craft, we need to knot the other end. Pinch some thread between your thumb and pointer finger, then twist it around your finger to make a loop. Next, take the end of the thread and push it through the loop, pull it tight, and voilà! You've got a knot! If you want it to be extra secure, you can make another knot on top of the first one. 6. Ready, Set, Create! Great job! Your thread is now all set and ready to use for sewing, making a craft, or creating a lovely piece of art. Have fun with your thread, and remember to always ask for help from a grown-up if you need it. Happy crafting!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: Context_1 : Anthony Asquith ( ; 9 November 1902 – 20 February 1968) was a leading English film director. He collaborated successfully with playwright Terence Rattigan on \\"The Winslow Boy\\" (1948) and \\"The Browning Version\\" (1951), among other adaptations. His other notable films include \\"Pygmalion\\" (1938), \\"French Without Tears\\" (1940), \\"The Way to the Stars\\" (1945) and a 1952 adaptation of Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\". Context_2 : A Cottage on Dartmoor (a.k.a. Escape from Dartmoor) is a 1929 British silent film, directed by Anthony Asquith and starring Norah Baring and Uno Henning. The cameraman was Stanley Rodwell. It was the last of Asquith's four silent films, produced exactly on the cusp of the transition from silents to talkies in British cinema, a point which is referenced in the film itself. Context_3 : Katharine Blake (11 September 1921 – 1 March 1991) was a South African-born British actress, with an extensive career in television and movies. She was married to director Charles Jarrott. Context_4 : Charles Jarrott (26 March 1877 – 4 January 1944) was an English racing car driver and businessman. Jarrott raced from 1900 to 1904, winning the 1902 Circuit des Ardennes race and competing in the 1903 and 1904 Gordon Bennett Cup races. He co-founded a car import firm in 1902 and was a founder member of the Automobile Association (the AA), serving as chairman in 1922. Context_5 : Anne of the Thousand Days is a 1969 British costume drama made by Hal Wallis Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. It was directed by Charles Jarrott and produced by Hal B.

V současné době je pro systémy RFID k dispozici několik kmitočtových pásem na bezlicenčním základě[11] a ve většině zemí EU již tomu tak je po mnoho let. Translate to English","output":"At present, several frequency bands are available for RFID systems on an unlicensed basis[11], and this has been the case in most EU countries for many years. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has become increasingly popular in the last few years, primarily for its applications in supply chain management, logistics, and asset tracking. The RFID technology uses radio waves to wirelessly transmit the identity of an object, in the form of a unique serial number, from an RFID tag attached to the object to an RFID reader.  Governments around the world regulate the frequency bands that can be used for RFID systems. In the case of the European Union (EU), several frequency bands are available for unlicensed RFID systems, meaning that companies and organizations can use these bands without obtaining a specific license. This convenient policy has made it easier for companies in the EU to adopt and implement RFID technologies. However, it is essential to understand that these unlicensed frequency bands are not exclusive to individual organizations. As a result, interference between various RFID systems using the same frequency may occur, which can potentially affect the performance of the systems involved.  To ensure the smooth operation of RFID systems, it is crucial for companies to select frequencies that are suitable for their particular applications. Some key factors to consider include the range at which the RFID system needs to operate, the type of environment in which the RFID system will be used, and the specific materials that the RFID tags will be attached to. These factors can also help minimize potential interference with other RFID systems operating within the same frequency band. Having multiple frequency bands available on an unlicensed basis has facilitated the widespread adoption of RFID technology in the European Union. This has led to improved efficiency, asset management, and better tracking information for various industries, ultimately benefiting the European economy as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But I can use this background: The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body.

Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor. What country made gains in the Treaty of Hubertusburg?","output":"The Treaty of Hubertusburg, signed on February 15, 1763, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, effectively restored the status quo of 1748. While no country gained new territories, it could be argued that Prussia emerged as a winner by maintaining and solidifying its gains from the past. In this treaty, Silesia and Glatz, which had been the main subjects of conflict during the Seven Years' War, were retained and reverted to Frederick of Prussia. Despite Austria's attempt to reclaim at least Glatz, Frederick did not allow it. Saxony was restored to its elector, with Prussia refusing to evacuate Saxony until the elector had renounced any claims to reparation. The only concession made by Prussia to Austria was agreeing to the election of Archduke Joseph as the Holy Roman Emperor. However, this did not lead to territorial gains or losses for Austria. In summary, although no country made significant territorial gains in the Treaty of Hubertusburg, Prussia managed to maintain and solidify its previously acquired territories, primarily Silesia and Glatz. This outcome enabled Prussia to establish itself as a European power and reinforced its influence in the region, especially against its rivals, Austria and Saxony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A college football game typically generates significant interest among fans, making the college campus a popular spot for social gathering. 3. Competition: College football games are marked by intense rivalry between teams, leading to passionate displays from players, coaches, and fans alike. The mention of \\"the most popular spot\\" implies that there is a high level of enthusiasm for the game. College campuses epitomize the competitive spirit and camaraderie found in these events, making them ideal venues for such high-stakes matches. 4. Relevance: Among the possible answers, \\"college campus\\" is the most fitting context for the scenario described in the question. While \\"players\\" and \\"high school\\" also pertain to football, they lack the scale and fanbase necessary to accommodate a hundred thousand people. Meanwhile, \\"Texas\\" and \\"Oklahoma\\" are geographical locations that do not fully capture the essence of the scenario, which revolves around a specific venue with high popularity. Taking these factors into account, \\"college campus\\" emerges as the most appropriate answer due to its scale, popularity, and ability to offer the right context for the high-profile match described in the given scenario. Additionally, human common sense also considers the location where the scenario is likely to take place, which in this case, is a college campus known for hosting large football events that attract thousands of people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Process:  - A star forms - The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula - The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star.  suppose star is in a stable environment happens, how will it affect a SMALLER white dwarf star.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"In a stable environment where a star goes through the process described above and becomes a white dwarf star, the impact on a smaller white dwarf star nearby can be seen in different ways. First, let's analyze the specific scenario mentioned, and then for each of the following conditions, we'll determine whether the impact is direct, indirect, or non-existent. 1) Directly impacting a step of the process: White dwarfs are the compact remnants of low to intermediate-mass stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel and shed their outer layers. A smaller white dwarf star in the vicinity of the described star may experience a direct impact in its evolution if it's part of a binary system, meaning it shares a common center of mass with the larger star. During the process of the larger star becoming a red giant and shedding its outer layers to form a nebula, the smaller white dwarf may accrete some of this material, leading to mass transfer between the stars. This can have a direct influence on the smaller white dwarf's properties such as its mass, temperature, and chemical composition, and may lead to an accelerated cooling process or even trigger a nova or supernova event if the mass transfer is significant. 2) Indirectly impacting a step of the process: An indirect impact on the smaller white dwarf star could be a result of the radiation and stellar wind from the larger star during its red giant phase. As the red giant loses mass and ejects its outer layers, the radiation and wind may potentially disturb the outer layers of the smaller white dwarf or even alter its orbit around the gravitational center of the binary system. This indirect influence may affect the small white dwarf star's long-term stability and can potentially change its physical characteristics over time. 3) Not impacting any step of the process: In some cases, the larger star's evolution might not have an observable impact on the smaller white dwarf star. This would be likely if the white dwarfs are not part of a close binary system or if they are located at a considerable distance from each other. In this scenario, the processes occurring in the larger star would not have a significant or observable effect on the smaller white dwarf. In conclusion, the perturbation on the smaller white dwarf star by the larger star's evolution process depends on the specific characteristics of their system, such as their masses, distances, and whether or not they are in a close binary system. The impacts can be direct, indirect, or non-existent depending on these factors and the specific stage of the larger star's evolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Antarctica? What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Thar Desert?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They both inquire about the Sahara and ask for a comparison of temperatures, but they are referring to different regions with distinct climatic conditions. Let's analyze each question separately. 1. What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Antarctica? The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world, covering an area of approximately 9.2 million square kilometers (3.6 million square miles) in North Africa. It stretches across multiple countries, including Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Sudan, and Tunisia. The Sahara consists of different geographical features such as sand dunes, rocky plateaus, salt flats, and dry valleys. It has a predominantly arid and hot climate characterized by high temperatures and low precipitation. In contrast, Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and it sits predominantly within the Antarctic Circle. It is the fifth largest continent, encompassing approximately 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles) of ice-covered landmass. The climate in Antarctica is extremely cold, dry, and characterized as a polar desert, with average temperatures much lower than any other continent on Earth. Comparing the average temperatures of both regions, the Sahara typically experiences high temperatures ranging between 20°C (68°F) at night and 45°C (113°F) during the day. In some of the hottest months, temperatures can exceed 50°C (122°F). On the other hand, average temperatures in Antarctica differ significantly based on the area and the season. Coastal areas have relatively milder temperatures that may range from -10°C (14°F) in summer to -30°C (-22°F) in winter. However, in the interior regions, temperatures average around -30°C (-22°F) in summer and plunge to -60°C (-76°F) during winter. The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was in Antarctica, at -89.2°C (-128.6°F). Thus, this question seeks to understand the general climatic conditions in the Sahara and Antarctica regions and compare their average temperatures, which are vastly different. 2. What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Thar Desert? As described earlier, the Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world. It has arid and hot climatic conditions with high temperatures and low precipitation levels. The Thar Desert, also known as the Great Indian Desert, is a large arid region situated in northwest India and southeast Pakistan. Covering an area of approximately 200,000 square kilometers (77,000 square miles), it is the 18th largest subtropical desert globally. The Thar Desert has a predominantly arid climate, characterized by high temperatures, low precipitation, and varying terrain consisting of sand dunes, rocky hills, and barren plains. In terms of average temperatures, both the Sahara and Thar Desert experience hot and arid conditions. However, they differ in the extremities of their respective temperatures. As mentioned earlier, the Sahara typically experiences high temperatures of 20°C (68°F) at night and 45°C (113°F) during the day, with some months exceeding 50°C (122°F). In comparison, the Thar Desert has average temperatures ranging from 35°C to 42°C (95°F to 108°F) during the hot months of May and June. In winter, the average temperature drops to around 10°C (50°F) during the day and can get as low as 0°C (32°F) at night. In summary, this question seeks to compare the average temperatures of the Sahara and Thar Desert, two separate desert regions with distinct climatic conditions. While both deserts experience high temperatures and arid conditions, the Sahara's temperature range is generally more extreme than that of the Thar Desert."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Composed for the 1709–10 Venice Carnevale season, the opera tells the story of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an \\"anti-heroic satirical comedy\\", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI. Handel composed Agrippina at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised  the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including Agrippina, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century. In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007. Modern critical opinion is that Agrippina is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made it one of the most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival.  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who had an ongoing revival?

Poseidon, an ocean liner slated for retirement and scrapping, makes her way across the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea from New York City to Athens. Despite protests from Captain Harrison (Leslie Nielsen), who fears for the ship's safety, the representative of her new owners, Mr. Linarcos, insists that he should go at full speedâ26 or so knotsâtowards Athens to save money, preventing him from taking on additional ballast. The Reverend Frank Scott (Gene Hackman), a heretical minister believing God helps those who help themselves, delivers a sermon. Detective Lt. Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and wife Linda (Stella Stevens), a sarcastic former prostitute, deal with her seasickness. Susan (Pamela Sue Martin) and younger brother Robin (Eric Shea) are traveling to meet their parents. Robin is interested in how the ship works and frequently visits the engine room. Retired Jewish hardware store owner Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson) and wife Belle (Shelley Winters) are going to Israel to meet their two-year-old grandson for the first time. Haberdasher James Martin (Red Buttons) is a love-shy, health-conscious bachelor. The ship's singer, Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley), rehearses for the New Year's Day celebration with her band. That evening, passengers gather in the dining room to celebrate. Harrison is called to the bridge in response to a report of an undersea earthquake. He receives word from the lookout that a huge wave is approaching from the direction of Crete, at 60Â mph. He issues a mayday distress signal and commands a \\"hard left\\" turn, but it is too late. The wave hits the ship and she capsizes. In the dining room, survivors take stock of their predicament. Acres (Roddy McDowell), an injured waiter, is trapped at the galley door now high above.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how latin america has changed us culture Suggested answer: Original elements also play a strong role, such as the invention of Jeffersonian democracy . Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"To accurately determine if the suggested answer is valid, it is essential to first understand the context of the question, which is exploring the influence of Latin America on US culture. We can then evaluate the answer referring to the invention of Jeffersonian democracy to determine if it is indeed relevant to the topic at hand. Jeffersonian democracy refers to the political philosophy and principles advocated by Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. It emphasizes agrarianism, republicanism, limited government, and states' rights, primarily promoting the concept of individual liberty. This form of democracy is distinctively American and has shaped the political development of the country. On the other hand, Latin America has had significant impacts on the US culture, particularly in areas such as language, music, cuisine, arts, and religion. The United States has experienced growing cultural exchanges and interactions with Latin American nations, with substantial immigration from countries like Mexico, Cuba, and Puerto Rico affecting the demographics and cultural landscape of the US. Latin music genres like salsa, tango, and reggaeton have gained popularity and have been integrated into mainstream music. The same is true for Latin-American cuisine, as dishes such as tacos, enchiladas, and ceviche are now commonly found in the American food scene. Furthermore, religious practices such as the Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Day of the Dead celebration also exemplify how Latin America has shaped US culture. In relation to the suggested answer mentioning the invention of Jeffersonian democracy, it is evident that this aspect of US history is not directly related to the influence of Latin America on US culture. While the concept of Jeffersonian democracy is an essential element in American political history, it does not accurately address the original question focusing on the changes in US culture attributable to Latin American influences. In light of this evaluation, I recommend not validating the suggested answer as it does not accurately address the topic of how Latin America has changed US culture. Instead, the answer should provide specific examples of Latin American influences on American language, music, cuisine, arts, and religion, which are more relevant to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...what part of iceland is in the arctic circle??","output":"Iceland, an island nation in the North Atlantic, has a unique geographical location. The Arctic Circle, a line of latitude at 66°33'39\\" N, marks the southern boundary of the Arctic region. Most of Iceland lies below the Arctic Circle due to its latitude, which ranges between 63°23'05\\" N at the southernmost point and 66°32'00\\" N at its northernmost tip. However, a small portion of Iceland does fall within the Arctic Circle, predominantly the island of Grímsey. Grímsey is a remote island located approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the mainland of Iceland. It is the only part of the country that is truly within the Arctic Circle, as the line of latitude crosses the island. Grímsey measures about 5.3 square kilometers (2 square miles) in size, and its topography consists mainly of cliffs, coastal plains, and an extinct volcano, Basalt Hill. The island’s population is quite sparse, with only about 60 inhabitants. Since the Arctic Circle is not a static line and shifts slightly due to Earth's axial tilt and atmospheric refraction, Grímsey occasionally falls outside the Arctic region for short periods of time. Nevertheless, it remains the main portion of Iceland that is within the Arctic Circle. In addition to Grímsey, Iceland has several other islands and skerries located to its north, such as Kolbeinsey and Mánáreyjar. Some of these smaller landmasses are also near or within the Arctic Circle. However, these islands are uninhabited and have limited access due to their remote locations and challenging weather conditions. The parts of Iceland belonging to the Arctic Circle hold significance in terms of their natural and cultural heritage. Grímsey, for example, is home to a diverse array of bird species, such as puffins, auks, and kittiwakes, making it an appealing destination for birdwatching and eco-tourism. Moreover, the island provides visitors a unique opportunity to experience the Midnight Sun during summer, as well as the enchanting Northern Lights during winter, both of which are characteristic of the Arctic region. In conclusion, while most of Iceland lies below the Arctic Circle, the island of Grímsey and a few minor islands and skerries to Iceland's north are considered within the Arctic region. These locations offer their own distinct ecological, cultural, and geographical contributions to the overall identity of Iceland as a nation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all.  Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles less?

Background: Kenneth Duva Burke (May 5, 1897 - November 19, 1993) was an American literary theorist, as well as poet, essayist, and novelist, who wrote on 20th-century philosophy, aesthetics, criticism, and rhetorical theory. As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional rhetoric and view literature as \\"symbolic action.\\" Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc. Context: He was born on May 5 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Peabody High School, where his friend Malcolm Cowley was also a student. While he attended Ohio State University to pursue courses in French, German, Greek, and Latin, he later dropped out to move closer to New York City where he enrolled at Columbia University. During his time there, he was a member of the Boar's Head Society. Due to the constraining learning environment, however, Burke also left Columbia, never receiving a college diploma. In Greenwich Village he kept company with avant-garde writers such as Hart Crane, Malcolm Cowley, Gorham Munson, and later Allen Tate. Raised by a Christian Science mother, Burke later became an avowed agnostic.  In 1919, he married Lily Mary Batterham, with whom he had three daughters: the late feminist, Marxist anthropologist Eleanor Leacock (1922-1987); musician (Jeanne) Elspeth Chapin Hart (b. 1920); and writer and poet France Burke (b. ~1925). He would later marry her sister Elizabeth Batterham in 1933 and have two sons, Michael and Anthony. Burke served as the editor of the modernist literary magazine The Dial in 1923, and as its music critic from 1927-1929. Kenneth himself was an avid player of the piano. He received the Dial Award in 1928 for distinguished service to American literature. He was the music critic of The Nation from 1934-1936, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935.  His work on criticism was a driving force for placing him back into the university spotlight. As a result, he was able to teach and lecture at various colleges, including Bennington College, while continuing his literary work. Many of Kenneth Burke's personal papers and correspondence are housed at Pennsylvania State University's Special Collections Library. However, despite his stint lecturing at Universities, Burke was an autodidact and a self-taught scholar.  In later life, his New Jersey farm was a popular summer retreat for his extended family, as reported by his grandson Harry Chapin, a contemporary popular song artist. He died of heart failure at his home in Andover, New Jersey. Question: What other books did he write?. Whats the answer?","output":"Kenneth Burke wrote many books in his lifetime. Some of his well-known books include: 1. Counter-Statement (1931) - A collection of essays that discuss literature, art, and the creative process. 2. Permanence and Change (1935) - A book exploring human communication and how people react to change. 3. A Grammar of Motives (1945) - A book that examines the ways humans use language and symbols to express their motives in different situations. 4. A Rhetoric of Motives (1950) - A follow-up to \\"A Grammar of Motives,\\" this book studies rhetoric and the use of symbols in persuasion. 5. The Rhetoric of Religion (1961) - A book discussing the use of language and symbolism in religious texts and practices. These are just a few examples of the many books Kenneth Burke wrote. He was an influential writer and theorist, and his ideas continue to be studied today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Did Loch Ness Monster’s saltwater cousin sink German U-boat UB-85 for the British in 1918? Engineers discovered wreck of the vessel off Scottish coast this week, reviving legend of the sea serpent's attack A REDISCOVERED German U-boat whose captain insisted it was sunk by a sea serpent could have been attacked by Loch Ness’s saltwater cousin, it has been claimed. UB-85 was finally found off the west coast of Scotland this week nearly 100 years since it was scuttled in the final months of the First World War. No German sailors went down with the 56-metre vessel and its captain Günther Krech reported being attacked by a large sea creature when captured by the Royal Navy. Under questioning by British forces he went on to describe how the ship's gunners fired at the mysterious creature's arms. But the ship was so badly damaged it could no longer dive beneath the waves - exposing it to the British fleet. He described a horned beast that possessed glinting eyes and small deep-set eyes. Its huge weight saw the U-boat list dangerously to one side, according to the legend. Now, the discovery of the wreck 50-metres underwater by engineers laying sea cables has revived the myth that a sea serpent joined the Allied war effort in April 1918. Loch Ness sighting expert Gary Campbell is convinced the animal was involved in the sinking of UB-85 - which was scuttled by sailors from HMS Coreopsis. He told the Guardian: \\"It’s great to see how Nessie’s saltwater cousin clearly got involved in helping with the war effort – she even managed to do the damage without anyone being killed.\\" The site of the wreck lies around 200 miles south of the Loch - which is connected to the sea via the River Lochy. The area was littered with German U-boats which were trying to cut off British supplies lines and starve the country into submission. More than 351 vessels sunk around 5,000 Allied merchant ships during the course of the war. The legend of the Loch Ness Monster captured the world's imagination in 1933 when a picture taken by a London doctor caught what appeared to be a long-necked animal swimming through the giant body of water.

Article: Scientists in Colombia have trained a team of rats to help remove land mines from the countryside. Land mines are small bombs hidden in the ground and designed to explode  when someone steps on them. When trained, the rats can smell special metals in the mines and then signal  to their human team. Then why use rats for such an important job? In the past, dogs have been used to find bombs. Rats have a good sense of smell and can respond to orders, just like dogs do. But rats are much lighter than dogs. They stand less of a chance of setting off the mines, which explode under a certain amount of weight. What's more, the best rats are cheaper to keep than dogs. It costs about the same amount of money to take care of one dog as it does 70 rats. The rats have already been used in Tanzania, an African country with many land mines. Luisa Fernanda Mendez and her team in Colombia are training the even lighter Wistar rats. These are the white rats with red eyes that scientists often use in laboratory experiments. \\" _ even train their babies to perform their jobs, which saves us a lot of time, \\" Mendez said. Colombia has the second-highest rate  of deaths from land mine accidents in the world. Last year, land mines killed 695 people -- 56 of whom were children. A criminal group called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as well as other organizations, have placed the mines. FARC are strongly against Colombia's government. The group has placed mines all around its own bases and in many places in the countryside. In the past, the Colombian government hired peasants and poor farmers to find mines. Many of them died trying to find the well-hidden bombs. Colombian police official Erick Guzman hopes the team of rats can come to the rescue . \\"These rats will be a great help,\\" he said. Question: The advantage of rats over dogs in finding bombs is that   _  . Options: A: they are cleverer.

The great mathematician John von Neumann was one of the founders of game theory.In particular,he showed that all games fall into two classes:there are what he called games of  'perfect information', games like chess where the players can't hide anything or play tricks:they don't win by chance,but by means of logic and skills.Then there are games of 'imperfect information', 1ike poker,in which it is impossible to know in advance that one course of action is better than another. One mistaken idea about business is that it can be treated as a game of perfect information.Quite the reverse.Business,politics,life itself are games which we must normally play with very imperfect information.Business decisions are often made with many unknown and unknowable factors which would even puzzle best poker players.But few business people find it comfortable to admit that they are taking a chance,and many still prefer to believe that they are playing chess,not poker.

Make this proper case.","output":"The area, commonly referred to as Polesie, holds significance for both Belarusians and Ukrainians as it has a rich history that traces back to its formation in December 1939. Polesie, also spelled as Polesia or Polesie, is a region located in the Eastern European Lowland, spanning across contemporary Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland. It is characterized by its unique geography, culture, and biodiversity, which have inspired a distinct way of life for the communities in the region. In December 1939, Polesie's contemporary political borders were established after a sequence of historical events. As a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed in August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, parts of eastern Poland were annexed by the USSR, creating Western Belarus and integrating it into the newly-formed Belarusian SSR. The specific annexed territories include the regions of Polesie, Volhynia, and Białowieża Forest. This event holds significant importance for both Belarusians and Ukrainians, as it marked a challenging period in the region's history that witnessed border transitions, population movements, and a shift in political systems. The acquisition of the Polesie area strengthened the cultural and economic connections between the different Slavic communities living within the Soviet borders, thereby fostering a sense of unity among the people. Polesie has a diverse natural landscape consisting of vast swamps, forests, and wetlands, contributing to its ecological significance. The Pripyat River, which flows through the heart of the region, plays a crucial role in shaping Polesie's geography and defining the lifestyle of its inhabitants. In addition to its natural beauty, Polesie has a rich cultural heritage, preserved in the customs, folk arts, traditional crafts, and architectural styles of the region. Due to this diverse environment, the area has become a haven for numerous plant and animal species, some of which are endangered or unique to Polesie. This ecological value has drawn the attention of researchers and conservationists who strive to study and protect the region's biodiversity. In conclusion, Polesie is a historically and ecologically rich area within Eastern Europe that holds great importance for Belarusians, Ukrainians, and Poles alike. The region was formally assembled in December 1939, and since then, this territory has played a significant role in shaping the cultural, social, and political heritage of the people who call it home. The preservation and celebration of this shared history are crucial for fostering unity and mutual respect among these communities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"As of the start of the 2021 NFL season, there are three Black head coaches in the league. They are Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brian Flores of the Miami Dolphins, and David Culley of the Houston Texans. However, it is worth noting that numbers can change over time with new coaching hires, firings, or promotions throughout the season or in future seasons. To get the most accurate and current number, it's best to check the latest news and updates in the NFL. Regarding the absence of minority QB (quarterback) coaches in the NFL, it is a separate and distinct issue from the number of Black head coaches. While both questions relate to the under-representation of minority coaches in the NFL, they focus on different coaching positions. The fact that there are no minority QB coaches in the league highlights the specific lack of diversity at a position that is crucial in developing quarterbacks, who are often the face of the franchise and play a major role in a team's success. Historically, there has been a perception that minorities were not suitable for the QB position due to biases, stereotypes or lack of representation in coaching staffs. While the situation for minority quarterbacks has improved significantly over the past couple of decades, the lack of representation within the coaching staff, specifically in the QB coach role, is still a problematic area. Several factors contribute to the lack of minority coaches in the NFL, including limited opportunities, implicit bias during the hiring process, organizational culture, and the NFL's \\"old boys' club,\\" which often perpetuates the cycle of hiring individuals who are a part of certain networks or have shared backgrounds. It's important to note that the NFL has implemented policies such as the Rooney Rule, which mandates that teams must interview at least one minority candidate for head coaching positions and some senior-level football operations positions. While this rule has had some success in addressing the under-representation of minority coaching candidates, it still doesn't fully cover other coaching positions, such as QB coaches. In conclusion, the two questions are related as both touch upon the issue of minority representation in the NFL coaching landscape. However, they are not paraphrases of each other, as the first question specifically asks about the number of Black head coaches, while the second question delves into the absence of minority QB coaches in the league."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Which light emitting diodes display the greatest number of characters?\\"  Context: \\"Alphanumeric LEDs are available in seven-segment, starburst and dot-matrix format. Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters. Dot-matrix displays typically use 5x7 pixels per character. Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of liquid crystal displays, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Dot-matrix LED displays display the greatest number of characters among the three types of alphanumeric LEDs mentioned: seven-segment, starburst, and dot-matrix. While seven-segment displays can handle all numbers and a limited set of letters and starburst displays can display all letters, dot-matrix displays provide greater flexibility and character range due to their use of individual pixels. In a dot-matrix display, characters are represented using a grid of small pixels, typically arranged in a 5x7 format. This allows for a much wider variety of characters, symbols, and even custom images to be displayed compared to seven-segment and starburst displays. The flexibility and versatility of dot-matrix displays have contributed to their popularity in various applications, including text-based notifications, advertisements, and animated graphics.

Options: - bounding - death - grief - judgement - appeals  Explain why a human would choose \\"death\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human might choose \\"death\\" to answer the question above because: Step 1: Analyze the question and options given. The question asks for a potential cause of having a last passing sentence. The options given are bounding, death, grief, judgment, and appeals. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options. Bounding refers to a particular movement related to leaping or jumping, which is not relevant to a last passing sentence. Appeals are generally related to legal contexts and mainly concern requesting changes to decisions. While they may be connected to a last passing sentence, they are not universally applicable. Step 3: Consider the remaining options. Death, grief, and judgment remain as options to consider.  Step 4: Compare the plausibility of each option. Death is a plausible cause of a last passing sentence because it is the final moment of life, which generally results in a person's last words or expressions. Grief can be a consequence of death and loss, affecting individuals who are mourning but is not directly linked to a last passing sentence, rather a reaction to it. Judgment, although contextually viable in a legal sense, is not as universally applicable as death. Step 5: Choose the most fitting option based on the analysis.

Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday. Bishops with diocesan responsibilities, however, are created cardinal priests. A:","output":"Step 1: Identify the key terms in the question. In this case, the key terms are \\"highest status\\" and \\"cardinals.\\" Step 2: Scan the context for information related to the key terms. In the context provided, there are mentions of \\"cardinal deacons,\\" \\"cardinal priests,\\" and associated rankings. Step 3: Analyze the context to find the relevant information. The context states that \\"cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals,\\" which implies there may be a higher status. It also mentions that \\"bishops with diocesan responsibilities... are created cardinal priests.\\" Step 4: Determine the hierarchy based on the information from the context. Since cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking, and cardinal priests are higher-ranking (as they are responsible for diocesan-level duties), the current information suggests that cardinal priests have a higher status compared to cardinal deacons. Step 5: Evaluate whether there is any further hierarchy for cardinals mentioned within the context. As per the provided context, there is no other cardinal status mentioned after cardinal priests.  Answer: Based on the provided context, the highest status in cardinals is cardinal priests."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who does Thespis suggests goes down to earth in disguise to mingle and judge for themselves what people think of them? from the following article ?  Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus On Mount Olympus, the elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on Earth.  Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery.  Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it.  Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis.  The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic.  Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis.  In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back.  Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter.  All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis.  Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods.  Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them.  They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth.  Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence.  Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter.  Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need. Answer:","output":"Thespis suggests that Jupiter, Mars, and Apollo go down to earth in disguise to mingle and judge for themselves what people think of them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what does qatar export?\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"Qatar, a small yet affluent country located in the Arabian Peninsula, is known for its substantial hydrocarbon reserves and role in the global energy market, particularly natural gas. The country's main export products primarily revolve around the oil and gas industry. Here are the key exports of Qatar: 1. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG): Qatar is the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, holding a significant market share. The country's large reserves of natural gas are mainly extracted from the North Field, which is the world's largest non-associated natural gas field. Major LNG customers include Japan, South Korea, India, China, and several European countries. 2. Crude oil: Alongside liquefied natural gas, Qatar also exports significant amounts of crude oil, although its production and export levels are much lower compared to other Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran. With vast oil reserves, crude oil sales continue to play a vital role in Qatar's national income. 3. Petrochemicals and Chemical products: Qatar's thriving oil and gas industry also supports a growing petrochemical sector that exports various products such as polymers, fertilizers, and chemicals. The country's petrochemical facilities manufacture a range of downstream products, creating added value in the export market. 4. Refined Petroleum Products: Qatar refines some of its crude oil and processes it into various petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other fuel oils. These products are then exported to markets around the world. 5. Aluminum: Outside of the energy sector, Qatar is also a significant exporter of aluminum. Qatalum, a primary aluminum producer in Qatar, operates a large production facility that has an annual capacity of over 600,000 metric tons. This non-energy sector export contributes to Qatar's foreign exchange earnings. 6. Steel: Qatar Steel, a key steel producer in the Middle East, also contributes to the country's export portfolio by exporting its products like rebar, wire rod, and steel billets to international markets. In summary, while Qatar is primarily recognized for its export of liquefied natural gas and crude oil, it also exports a diverse range of products within and beyond the energy sector. With a strong focus on its hydrocarbon industry, the country continues to invest in growth and diversification strategies to maintain its position as a global exporter and economic powerhouse."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a \\"real tree\\" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Grammy Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if they brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his way home, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Mr. Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen to Thneedville residents. O'Hare explains to Ted that because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business whenever he hears people talking about them. After revealing that he has \\"security camera eyes\\" all over the city, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O'Hare's sight (with his grandmother's encouragement) and learns more of the trees' history. Over Ted's various visits, the Once-ler recounts the story that when he was a young man, he departed his family to find good material for his Thneed invention and make a business. After stumbling upon a lush Truffula Tree forest valley, the Once-ler meets the guardian of the forest, the Lorax, after cutting down a Truffula Tree. The Lorax urges the Once-ler to leave the forest, but the Once-ler refuses. Eventually, the Once-ler promises not to chop another tree down, and the two seem to begin a friendship of sorts.

A small Myotis was captured at a cave in Latvia between 2007 and 2010; pending genetic testing, it is suspected to be M. alcathoe. However, this record had not been confirmed in the subsequent national report to EUROBATS in 2014. Luxembourg A single male was caught in 2011 and confirmed as M. alcathoe on the basis of genetic data. Elsewhere in the country it has been recorded on the basis of acoustic data. Poland The species was recorded in four caves in southern Poland in 2005 and 2006, and later at several other sites in the south of the country. It is known from 182 to 1,294 m (597 to 4,245 ft) above sea level, most often in beech forest (Fagus sylvatica), but also in several other forest types. Romania A single M. alcathoe was captured in 2007 in a nature reserve in the eastern Carpathians; the reserve contains riverine and conifer forest. The species was additionally recorded in a forested valley containing a small stream in Alba County. Russian part of Caucasus Bats collected in the Russian part of the Caucasus and in Abkhazia (a breakaway part of Georgia) from 2003 to 2009 may represent M. alcathoe. They are small and morphometrically distinct from other local Myotis mystacinus-like bats. The affinity of these bats to M. alcathoe has recently been confirmed by the genetic and morphological analyses. Serbia The species was reported on the basis of three specimens shortly before 2009, but is probably rare. Slovakia Here, M. alcathoe is known from a single site, a cave in old deciduous forest at 525 m (1,722 ft) altitude.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were  Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When  Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"300 million\\" correctly answer the question \\"How much money did al Qaeda use to fund the 9/11 attacks?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"300 million\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"How much money did al Qaeda use to fund the 9/11 attacks?\\". According to the paragraph, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The 300 million figure mentioned in the text refers to the purported inheritance of Osama Bin Laden, which was later discovered to be inaccurate and not a source of funding for the 9/11 attacks.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Areus I (died 265 BC) was Agiad King of Sparta from 309 to 265 BC, who died in battle near Corinth during the Chremonidean War. He was the grandson of Cleomenes II and was succeeded by his son Acrotatus II.  - Agesipolis II (died 369 BC), son of the king Cleombrotus I, succeeded his father and reigned as Agiad King of Sparta. His rule was exceedingly brief, from, at most, 371 until his death in 369 BC. He was succeeded by his brother Cleomenes II.  - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - In Greek mythology, Eurotas was a king of Laconia, the son of King Myles and grandson of Lelex, eponymous ancestor of the Leleges. He had no male heir, but he did have a daughter Sparta and wife Clete. Eurotas bequeathed the kingdom to Lacedaemon, the son of Taygete, after whom Mount Taygetus is named, and Zeus, according to Pausanias. Lacedaemon married Sparta and renamed the state after his wife.  - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City.  - Cleomenes II (died 309 BC) was Agiad King of Sparta from 369 to 309 BC. The son of Cleombrotus I, he succeeded his brother Agesipolis II. He was the father of Acrotatus I, the father of Areus I, and of Cleonymus, the father of Leonidas II.  - Cleombrotus I ( Greek :    ; died July 6 , 371 BC ) was a Spartan king of the Agiad line , reigning from 380 BC until 371 BC. Little is known of Cleombrotus ' early life . Son of Pausanias , he became king of Sparta after the death of his brother Agesipolis I in 380 BC , and led the allied Spartan - Peloponnesian army against the Thebans under Epaminondas in the Battle of Leuctra . His death and the utter defeat of his army led to the end of Spartan dominance in ancient Greece . Cleombrotus was succeeded by his son Agesipolis II. His other son was Cleomenes II. Many historians cite Cleombrotus as being a Pro-Theban Spartan ( meaning he had pro-Theban tendencies ) unlike his fellow king , Agesilaus II. He was blamed for the humiliating defeat at Leuctra by his contemporaries for being biased towards the enemy , though some modern historians do not believe that he was actually pro-Theban .  - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.  Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki.  - Leonidas II (Greek:  B, \\"Lion's son\\", \\"Lion-like\\"), was the 28th Agiad King of Sparta from 254 to 235 BC. He was raised at the Persian Court, and according to Plutarch's Life of Agis IV, he married a Persian woman. According to other sources, this non-Spartan wife was actually a Seleucid, possibly the daughter of Seleucus I Nicator by his Persian wife Apama. She was therefore not fully Persian, but half-Macedonian and half-Persian. His Persian-influenced lifestyle, his non-Spartan (therefore foreign) wife and his half-Spartan children would all be made issues by the ephor Lysander, the co-king Agis IV and their supporters.  - Acrotatus I (Gr. ) was the son of Cleomenes II, king of Sparta. He incurred the displeasure of an influential group of Spartan citizens by opposing the decree which was to release from infamy all who had fled from the battle in which Antipater defeated Agis in 331 BC. He was thus glad to accept the offer from the Agrigentines who had asked Sparta for assistance in 314 BC against Agathocles of Syracuse.   - Epaminondas (\\"Epameinondas\\"; d. 362 BC) was a Theban general and statesman of the 4th century BC who transformed the Ancient Greek city-state of Thebes, leading it out of Spartan subjugation into a pre-eminent position in Greek politics. In the process he broke Spartan military power with his victory at Leuctra and liberated the Messenian helots, a group of Peloponnesian Greeks who had been enslaved under Spartan rule for some 230 years after being defeated in the Messenian War ending in 600 BC. Epaminondas reshaped the political map of Greece, fragmented old alliances, created new ones, and supervised the construction of entire cities. He was also militarily influential and invented and implemented several major battlefield tactics.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'cleombrotus i' with the relationship of 'occupation'.

Given the below context:  The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" was shot immediately after that of \\"If I Were a Boy\\", but it received less attention during production than the \\"higher-gloss, higher-profile video\\" for \\"If I Were a Boy\\". Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 Bob Fosse routine entitled \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" seen on The Ed Sullivan Show, which featured Fosse's wife, Gwen Verdon, dancing with two other women. \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after Unk's \\"Walk It Out\\" was dubbed over the original mix. Beyoncé wanted to attempt a similar dance and eventually, the choreography of \\"Single Ladies\\" was liberally adapted from \\"Mexican Breakfast\\": I saw a video on YouTube. [The dancers] had a plain background and it was shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.' We kept a lot of the Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So it was a strange mixture ... It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.  Guess a valid title for it!

Article: Erden Eruc has been rowing across the Pacific Ocean in a rowboat since he left California on July 10, 2007. He has been heading for Australia with only birds, fish, and sharks ever since. Crossing the Pacific is only part of his journey. Eruc has decided to go all the way around the world using his own energy. He will row, bike, walk and climb the world without help from any motors  at all. His plan includes climbing the tallest peak on six of the continents  along the way. For the first part of his trip, he bicycled 5,546 miles from Seattle, Washington to Mount McKinley in Alaska and back, walked 67 miles to base camp and climbed 20,320 feet to McKinley's peak. Now in the second part of his adventure , he is rowing to Australia. Why would he try to go around the world this way? He explains that he wants to encourage kids to dream their dreams and get to their own goals. He wants to show kids that there might be hard parts along the way, and sometimes they might not even get to that final goal. But they can have adventures and learn a lot along the way. When his trip around the world takes him across land, he enjoys meeting people---especially children. He has already visited many schools and shared his story. Eruc encourages all kids to set their eyes on a goal and not give up. He says, \\"with goals, we will make progress, and we will be farther along than when we started, even if we don't get to some goals.  That's called life!\\" Question: We can learn from the passage that Eruc   _   during his adventure. Options: A: took a train B: rowed his boat C: traveled by air D: traveled by bus The answer is:","output":"B: Rowed his boat. In the article, it is mentioned that Erden Eruc is attempting to travel around the world using only his own energy, without the assistance of any motors. As part of this incredible journey, he has rowed across the Pacific Ocean in a rowboat, heading for Australia. This endeavor forms the second part of his larger adventure. Eruc's epic quest began with a 5,546-mile bicycle ride from Seattle, Washington to Mount McKinley in Alaska, followed by a 67-mile walk to the base camp and a 20,320-foot climb to McKinley's peak. Eruc's overall mission is to inspire children to dream big, set goals, and persevere despite the challenges they may face. He emphasizes the importance of setting goals and working toward them, even if some goals are not achieved along the way. Throughout his journey, Eruc has enjoyed meeting people, particularly children, and sharing his inspiring story at numerous schools. Given the details provided in the passage, option B, \\"rowed his boat,\\" is the correct answer. This choice highlights a key component of Eruc's adventure, as he seeks to complete his journey around the world using only human-powered transportation methods, such as rowing, biking, walking, and climbing. Options A, C, and D (taking a train, traveling by air, and traveling by bus) are incorrect, as they involve the use of motors, which Eruc is intentionally avoiding in his quest to circumnavigate the globe using only his own energy."},{"instruction":"What type of details about august wilhelm graf von kanitz  can be gathered from the following bio?

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. See a medical professional immediately for treatment, even if you think the bite isn’t serious. After all, it’s easy to incorrectly identify a spider bite. It’s a good idea to get an large antihistamine injection as soon as you can, even if you don’t know the type of spider bite. While anti-venom is available in most ambulances, it might be a little while before the proper one can be selected and administered. This will help slow the spread of the venom and bring down the swelling. If you believe the bite is from a Brazilian wandering spider, apply a warm compress. This will help reduce blood pressure in the area. If the bite is on an arm or a leg, elevate the limb and tie a snug bandage above the bite. You should also move as little as possible to slow the spread of the venom.  Be careful not to cut off circulation when tying the bandage. If you believe you are dealing with a redback bite, don’t tie a bandage around the area. Redback venom spreads slowly, so the bandage won’t do much except worsen the pain. Even if the spider is squashed, try to save it and bring it with you to the medical facility. Blood tests can reveal the type of spider bite, but having the specimen can speed up the identification and treatment process. Rubbing alcohol can be used to preserve a spider.

Seventy-five years ago, the government cut 65-year-old Ida May Fuller a check. It was numbered 00-000-001 - the first Social Security payout. Fuller, of Ludlow, Vermont, didn't realize it at the time, but her check helped launch the granddaddy of all entitlement programs. She had only paid three years' worth of payroll taxes before retiring but by the time of her death in 1975 at age 100, she collected 22,888.92 from Social Security monthly benefits. Scroll down for video Flashback: Seventy-five years ago, the government cut Ida May Fuller, 65, a check. It was numbered 00-000-001 - the first Social Security payout - here she is pictured in 1950 holding a Social Security check for 41.30 Today, even as its future lies in financial uncertainty, many consider","output":"Social Security to be a crucial lifeline for millions of Americans who are retired, disabled, or otherwise in need of monetary support. In the decades since Ida May Fuller's first check was issued, the program has come a long way, evolving to accommodate the changing needs of the American population.  The Social Security system was initially created in 1935 as a response to the Great Depression, with the goal of providing financial assistance to retired workers who may not have had ample savings or employment pension plans to support them. The program was designed to be funded through payroll taxes, with workers and their employers making equal contributions throughout their working lives. The financial stability of the program was based on the assumption that the number of younger workers contributing to the system would always be significantly larger than the number of retirees drawing benefits. However, as the U.S. population has aged and the birth rate has declined, the balance between contributors and beneficiaries has been disrupted, casting doubt on the sustainability of the system. Currently, Social Security not only provides benefits for retirees but also covers disabled workers, surviving spouses, and dependent children. About 64 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, with nearly 70% being retired workers who rely on the program as a major source of their income. Despite the crucial role it plays in providing financial stability for millions of Americans, the trust funds that support Social Security are projected to be depleted by 2035, bringing the future of the program into question. In light of this reality, various policy proposals have been put forth to address the looming financial crisis. Several potential solutions have emerged as being the most logical: 1. Increase the payroll tax rate: By moderately increasing the payroll tax rate, the additional revenue generated could be directed towards the Social Security trust funds, ensuring the system remains solvent for several more decades. 2. Raise the cap on taxable earnings: Currently, there is a limit on the amount of income subject to the payroll tax. By increasing or eliminating this cap, high-income earners would contribute more to the system, which would have a significant impact on Social Security's financial outlook. 3. Gradually increase the retirement age: Given that life expectancies have risen steadily since Social Security's inception, it would make sense to adjust the age at which full retirement benefits are received. By gradually raising the retirement age over time, the government could help extend the life of the trust funds without drastically reducing benefits for current retirees. 4. Make changes to the cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs): Adjusting the formula used to calculate COLAs could help put the program on a more financially sustainable path. This could be done by switching to a different inflation measure or modifying the way COLAs are determined. Ultimately, the future of Social Security will require a mix of adjustments to ensure that the program continues to provide essential support for millions of Americans who depend on it. The passage of time since Ida May Fuller received her first check only underscores the importance of reviewing and adapting the program to meet the evolving needs of the population. While there may be debate over which combination of proposed policy changes would be most effective, one thing is clear: without action, the financial stability of this vital social safety net is in jeopardy, and future generations may not have the same assurances enjoyed by retirees like Ida May Fuller. The most logical way to complete this passage is to emphasize the need for a bipartisan effort to preserve and strengthen Social Security, so that it can continue to serve as a lifeline for countless Americans in the years to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How Donald Lippincott blazed trail as first 100m record holder \\"There are so many stories in the walls,\\" says Gunilla Lyden, archivist, enthusiast, and key-holder to perhaps the best balcony in world sport. Her office (with balcony) lies up a stone spiral staircase in one of the most seductive sporting arenas anywhere: Stockholm's Olympic Stadium. Built for the 1912 Games, the stadium cost 1.25m Swedish Krona - around £5m in today's money. Its brown brickwork is handsome and its scale is intimate. And it is the oldest Olympic stadium still in use - for events ranging from local school competitions all the way up to the Diamond League. Lyden describes being among the 14,000-capacity crowd watching Usain Bolt win the 200m at a Diamond League meeting in July last year. It was so quiet, she says, \\"you could hear Bolt breathe\\". After much fiddling with keys, she opens the door and I am allowed to step on to her office balcony, with a view over the entire track. \\"This is where I can speak to my people,\\" she says, with a twinkle. \\"No, but the architect: he wasn't just creating a stadium. He was creating a dream.\\" The reality was impressive enough. The Stockholm stadium saw 83 world records set at the 1912 Olympics. Perhaps the most glittering was that set by an 18-year-old American, Donald F. Lippincott. This was how one American \\"One Cent\\" newspaper reported his achievement at the time: \\"LIPPINCOTT, PENN ATHLETE, CREATES WORLD'S RECORD. Stockholm, July 6. At the opening day's events of the Olympic games Donald F. Lippincott of the University of Pennsylvania hung up a new world's record for the 100 metres in heat 16, when he ran the distance in the marvellous time of 10 3-5 seconds.\\" These days, Donald Lippincott III remembers his grandfather as \\"a commanding presence, but not overbearing\\". A photograph of the time shows a bulky 18-year-old, with the slight slouch of a teenager unused to the attention. As he crouched at the start of a race, he tried to relieve excess nerves by squeezing a cork. It is still in the family's possession. But Lippincott almost did not make it to the Games at all. He had to raise, by himself, the money for his passage to Stockholm. And as his grandson recalls: \\"There is some lore in the family that his mother may have tried to block his going because he was her baby - the third child. And two months before, the Titanic had sunk. She couldn't bear the thought of losing him.\\" So Mrs Lippincott persuaded her husband to write their son a letter, saying that business was slumping. Donald Lippincott III laughs. \\"There's no record of business ever being bad before, but just by coincidence, it was suddenly bad. But then when he came up with (the sponsorship) money, it was hard for his parents to say no.\\" Lippincott ended up with the bronze in the final. Among the several false starts was one where he and the eventual winner ran the entire race, with Lippincott breasting the tape first, before they were called back. But he still had the world record from the heats - a record made official by the existence of the new International Amateur Athletics Federation. And 10.6 seconds is, as Imre Matrahazi, the IAAF's current keeper of the records, points out, an excellent time. \\"If you imagine the quality of the clay tracks then - and they didn't have starting blocks, they had to dig holes in the tracks. It really is an impressive time, 10.6 seconds.\\" That time was recorded by three men, in straw hats, standing next to the finish line and clicking their thumbs more or less simultaneously on three stopwatches. The Stockholm Olympics did experiment with \\"electric time-keeping\\" and photo finishes. But it would be 1921 before the first IAAF-sanctioned electrical time-keeping device was used. These days, a slit-film camera is aimed at the leading edge of the finish line, and takes 3,000 frames per second, as the runners clatter past. The technology and the athleticism are still improving. Matrahazi says, having watched Bolt set the latest world record of 9.58 seconds, he can imagine 9.5 seconds being within reach. Wherever the 100m is headed next, though, the Swedes will always have a boast of their own. Stockholm's stadium remains an impressive arena, still being used for sport a century after it was built. And it holds one achievement which will never be taken away. It is where the world's fastest man was - for the first time - officially fastest. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Donald Lippincott became the first official 100m record holder in 1912 at Stockholm's Olympic Stadium, setting a time of 10.6 seconds.

Article: Since the end of World War I (WWI) in 1918,Canadians, and millions of others around the world have paused at the 11thhour of the 11thday of the 11thmonth to honour the sacrifices our soldiers have made in different wars, fighting for the freedoms that we all enjoy today. Known as Remembrance Day, the day originated as a tribute to the soldiers of WWI, a dark period for our young country, which claimed the lives of over 60,000 military personnel and civilians and over 16 million dead worldwide. As there are no more surviving soldiers of WWI,today we rely on the wisdom and words of those soldiers who fought in the wars that followed,and this day now also recognizes their heroic contribution. They tell us to always remember what those brave souls fought for, and all they ask in return is that we never forget. That's why we wear the red poppy  ;that's why when we see a soldier in uniform we should stop him or her and say \\"Thank you\\" ; that's why we take a pause from our busy lives for two short minutes today to honor that request. Yet this message is fading away, year after year. Take for example the terrible decision to allow parents to excuse students from Remembrance Day ceremonies at school. Not only is this disrespectful, it distances the student from his or her classmates. It is difficult to understand why any Canadian parent would want to remove their child from the time-honored tradition of reading the poem In Flanders Fields, while a wreath of poppies is laid. It is more important than ever to teach school-aged children about our history,no matter how violent it was. Sheltering them from the realities of war is a great disservice. Understanding why conflicts happened, or happen today, can help shape choices and decisions they make as adults. Of course, because we live in a free society, we cannot force an individual to do something. _ is unfortunate, but some parents now have their child \\"opt-out\\" of the services. These people should be reminded they are free to make such choices only because of the men... Question: What can we learn from the passage? - War history is too violent for school children. - The writer was once a soldier in the Canadian army. - Few students are willing to take part in Remembrance Day ceremonies. - More parents are keeping their children away from frightening war stories. A:","output":"From the passage, we can learn that more parents are keeping their children away from frightening war stories. The author expresses concern that the tradition of honoring soldiers' sacrifices during Remembrance Day is fading away, and they believe it's crucial for school-aged children to learn about history, including the realities of war, to help shape their decisions as adults."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which kinds of software and technology are involved in data mining? How is data mining regulated or processed, if at all? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Hello! I'll break down the answers to your questions so they are easier to understand. 1) Which professors make great mentors to undergraduates at Delhi Technological University (especially in Data Mining)? The first question is asking about specific teachers at a school called Delhi Technological University who are good at helping students learn about Data Mining. Finding the right professor may involve asking for suggestions from classmates or seniors and looking up the professors' profiles on the school's website. Remember, great mentoring experiences can be different for different people, so it's always good to explore different options. 2) Which kinds of software and technology are involved in data mining? How is data mining regulated or processed, if at all? The second question has two parts: a) What kinds of tools help with data mining?    Data mining is like finding hidden treasures (information) in a big pile of mess (data). To do this, people use special software and tools that help them look for patterns and useful information. Some popular ones are called Excel, Python, and R. b) How is data mining regulated or processed?    Data mining has some rules because sometimes information can be private or sensitive, like your favorite toy. When people mine data, they have to be careful not to peek into someone else's private information. Regulation means there are rules for keeping information safe and secure. Processing involves sorting and organizing the data so it becomes easier to find those hidden treasures. Lastly, your two questions are not asking about the same information. The first question is about finding a good teacher for Data Mining at a university. The second question is about the tools and rules used in Data Mining. They're related because both are about learning and understanding Data Mining, but they ask for different details."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Controversial shock jock Anthony Cumia, who rose to fame as co-host of the \\"Opie & Anthony\\" radio show, was arrested on strangulation and assault charges on Long Island, police said Sunday.      Cumia, 54, was at his Roslyn Heights home around 11 a.m. ET Saturday when he got into an argument with a 26-year-old woman that turned violent, according to Nassau County police. He was arrested Saturday morning on charges of strangulation, assault, criminal mischief and unlawful imprisonment.      “Mr. Cumia emphatically denies the allegations brought against him, and is optimistic that when the truth comes out, he will be exonerated,\\" Cumia’s attorney, Alan Schwartz, said in a statement. \\"Simply put, things are not always what they appear to be, and this case is a perfect example of that.”      Cumia pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Sunday and was released without bail. An order of protection requires him to stay away from the woman.      The radio personality has been hosting his own online show since last year, after he was fired for what satellite radio company SiriusXM called a hate-filled Twitter rant.      The company fired him from the show after he expressed his outrage at a woman he said punched him in the face on a New York street. His tweets used an expletive degrading to women, and SiriusXM called them \\"racially charged.\\" The woman he encountered is black.      At the time, Cumia said he used words like \\"animal\\" and \\"savage\\" to describe people who resort to violence, not people of a certain race. He said the tweets echoed the way he had spoken on the radio for years, and he refused to apologize. ||||| Warning: Video contains graphic language      Disgraced former “Opie and Anthony” radio host Anthony Cumia was arrested after a fight with his girlfriend, which she partially captured via live streaming video in a clip that shows her claiming he broke her hand, police sources said Sunday.      The 26-year-old woman claims in the video — which was posted on the Periscope app under the name Dani Golightly — that Cumia, 54, “turned off” her phone when she tried to call the police.      “Hi, I’m in Long Island, I got my hand broken, I’m waiting for police to come,” said the distressed woman, whose real name has not been released. “I tried to call the police, but he turned the phone off.”      The video sharply cuts to the ground, and she yells, “Oh, my God, don’t hit me! . . . Stay away from me!”      The footage then pans to Cumia, who says, “I’ll pay you to leave my house.”      She screams right back, “I don’t need you to pay for a car! I need you to pay for my f–king broken hand!”      Cumia, who appears to be holding a beer, plays it for laughs, “Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Anthony and Dani show!” he says as he walks toward her, she backing away in apparent fear.      Cumia — who was thrown off the radio show last year after going on a racist Twitter rant — now hosts the Web-based “The Anthony Cumia Show.”      He was arrested Saturday morning at his Roslyn Heights home and charged with strangulation in the second degree, unlawful imprisonment in the second degree, assault in the third degree and criminal mischief in the third and fourth degree.      Various social-media accounts describe Golightly as a “NY comic.” She was also introduced as comedian Vinnie Brand’s daughter Danielle in a June 27, 2008, interview on the “Opie and Anthony” show.      The shock jock entered a plea of not guilty and was released on his own recognizance, though he was ordered to stay away from the woman.      “Mr. Cumia emphatically denies the allegations brought against him and is optimistic that when the truth comes out he will be exonerated,” his defense attorney, Alan Schwartz, said in a statement.      Cumia is scheduled to return to court on Jan 4.      The radio host lost his SiriusXM show in 2014 after he made a number of tweets about a Times Square run-in he had with an African-American woman.      “So, I’m taking pix in NYC & a black girl who was in frame punched me in the face. I called her a f–king “&;;-:” cause that’s what she WAS!” he wrote. “She’s lucky I was a white legal gun owner or she’d be dead. Then 5 blacks started giving me s–t!”      He also put out tweets declaring that “Savage violent animal . . . prey on white people. Easy targets.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Radio personality Anthony Cumia, best known as the co-host of the \\"Opie & Anthony\\" radio show, has been arrested on charges of strangulation, assault, criminal mischief, and unlawful imprisonment following an argument with a 26-year-old woman at his home.

Here is an article: January 16, 2014, 7:18 am Businesses have always lived by word of mouth, but in the old days the process was diffuse, hidden, incremental. Then Yelp kicked things up a few notches. It was bad news for bad businesses. Some shopkeepers and restaurant owners have been railing against Yelp since it began. They say customers try to blackmail them — “I want a free dessert or I’m going to post a negative review.” They mutter that Yelp shakes businesses down for advertising. There is no evidence this is true, and lawsuits alleging it have gone nowhere, but the scenario nevertheless populates the comments threads on news stories about Yelp. Now a Virginia carpet and rug cleaner is mounting a different sort of challenge to Yelp. Hadeed Carpet, a business in a Washington, D.C., suburb, had a bunch of negative reviews, the kind that would make any potential customer keep walking. For example, Bob G. said Hadeed ripped him off when he was in desperate need of carpet cleaning. Chris H. said he sent his “precious Afghan and other rugs” to Hadeed, all of which they shrunk. “I was shocked by how they handled my situation,” Chris added. Several customers complained that final charges were double the estimate they had been given. Hadeed asserts that Bob G. and the rest likely do not exist; presumably they were created by competitors trying to bring Hadeed down. That would remove the reviews from the protection of the First Amendment and make them slander. So it filed suit against the anonymous reviewers, and sought to compel Yelp to turn over their real names. If businesses could routinely do that with Yelp’s 47 million reviews, that might significantly undermine the site’s power. “Hadeed Carpet services 35,000 customers per year,” wrote the company’s lawyer, Raighne Delaney, in a comment on a Public Citizen post about the case. “It advertises a lot. It is interesting that a few anonymous comments target Hadeed Carpet’s advertising repeatedly. Are these different posters, or one poster with different names? Hadeed Carpet has not been able to identify these people as customers. If they are customers, Joe Hadeed wants to know so he can fix whatever problem he has.” A local court found in favor of Hadeed in late 2012, ordering Yelp held in civil contempt for failing to comply with the carpet cleaner’s subpoena. Now a Virginia appeals court has affirmed that ruling. The appeals court noted that dissatisfied customers “have a constitutional right to speak anonymously over the Internet. However, that right must be balanced against Hadeed’s right to protect its reputation.” As it stands, the ruling could open the door to a lot of lawsuits, at least In Virginia. “We feel this ruling fails to protect the free speech rights of Internet users, and in particular the rights of consumers who are turning to sites like Yelp to share their experience with a local business,” Yelp said in a statement. The site is appealing to the Virginia Supreme Court. Hadeed has been in business for over 50 years. It would be interesting to get Joe Hadeed’s comments on the suit, in particular who he thinks has such a great interest in maligning him. But he did not return a request for comment. A look at the Yelp page of Hadeed’s Alexandria location reveals 15 reviews. The two most recent are enthusiastic but most of the rest are pans. There are complaints about lowball price estimates, about a botched delivery and the actual work. “Carpets look worse after Hadeed ‘cleaned’ them,” one reviewer wrote. Those in search of a more upbeat picture can easily find one on Hadeed’s own site. Dozens of reviews are there, just about all laudatory. “Their pickup crew was on time, professional, and sweet to our two kitties,” wrote Fran, who chose anonymity even though she had only good things to say.

Answer: Between 1990 and 2010, about 663 million people moved above the absolute poverty level. Question: how poverty affects intelligence","output":"No, this answer does not directly address the question of how poverty affects intelligence.  To provide a detailed answer to the question, \\"how does poverty affect intelligence\\", we can discuss the following factors: 1. Nutrition: Poverty often leads to inadequate and insufficient nutrition, which can affect a child's brain development and cognitive function. Malnutrition, particularly during prenatal development and early childhood, can lead to long-lasting deficits in cognitive abilities. 2. Stress: Living in poverty can expose individuals to chronic stress, which may negatively affect brain development and cognitive functioning. Chronic stress has been linked to impairments in memory, attention, and decision-making. 3. Environmental factors: Poverty is often associated with substandard living conditions that expose individuals to harmful environmental factors such as lead or air pollution. These toxic exposures may result in diminished cognitive abilities and increased incidence of learning disabilities. 4. Limited access to quality education: Impoverished families often reside in areas with underfunded and low-performing schools, restricting access to proper educational resources and opportunities. These educational disparities can contribute to lower cognitive development and inhibit the acquisition of essential skills and knowledge. 5. Lack of cognitive stimulation: Children growing up in impoverished environments may have less access to stimulating activities and materials that foster cognitive development, such as books, educational games, and extracurricular activities. Cognitive stimulation is an essential component for the development of intellectual abilities. In conclusion, poverty can have several negative effects on intelligence through poor nutrition, chronic stress, exposure to harmful environmental factors, limited access to quality education, and lack of cognitive stimulation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the paragraph is discussing the process of expunging criminal records and its implications, we want to choose an option that is consistent with this topic and provides relevant information. Option A: This one is inconsistent with the topic because it mentions that the expungement process will be canceled if you have a criminal conviction, which contradicts the paragraph. Option B: This one is unclear and seems to be discussing consequences related to aggravated felonies but is not coherent enough to provide useful information. Option C: This one is thematically consistent with the paragraph and provides relevant information about the impact of expungement on a person's criminal record. It also mentions that the process will depend on the state, adding useful advice related to jurisdiction. Option D: This one is unrelated to the paragraph as it talks about prevention rather than expungement and lists some criminal offenses. It does not connect to the main topic under discussion.

Possible answers: (a). bladder; (b). pelvis; (c). cranium; (d). clavicle; Q: What supports the scapula, transmits the weight and forces from the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the underlying nerves and blood vessels?   A: Answer:","output":"(d). Clavicle; The clavicle, also known as the collarbone, supports the scapula, transmits the weight and forces from the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the underlying nerves and blood vessels. The clavicle is a long, slightly curved bone that connects the shoulder blade (scapula) to the sternum (breastbone) at the anterior aspect of the thorax. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the shoulder joint by providing stability and preventing dislocation. The clavicle serves as a strut, supporting the upper limb and transferring the forces generated by the arm to the axial skeleton. This ensures that any pressure or stress placed on the limbs is distributed evenly throughout the body, preventing injuries and maintaining balance. Several important nerves and blood vessels pass beneath the clavicle, making it a key component in the protection of these structures. The major blood vessels include the subclavian artery and subclavian vein, which supply and drain blood from the upper limb. The nerves that lie underneath the clavicle are part of the brachial plexus, a network of nerves that control sensation and movement in the arm and shoulder. By protecting these structures, the clavicle ensures their proper function and minimizes the risk of injury. Moreover, the clavicle plays a role in facilitating various movements of the shoulder and upper limb, such as elevation, depression, protraction, and retraction. Several muscles attach to the clavicle, including the pectoralis major, deltoid, trapezius, and sternocleidomastoid. These muscular attachments enable the clavicle to act as a pivot point for the scapula, allowing it to move in multiple planes and providing the necessary range of motion for different activities. In summary, the clavicle supports the scapula, transmits the weight and forces from the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the underlying nerves and blood vessels. Its unique shape and strategic location make it an essential component of the shoulder complex, ensuring stability, protection, and facilitation of various movements involving the upper limb."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Schoolchildren from around Wales also performed a rendition of Myfanwy at St David's Cathedral, Pembrokeshire. The parade in Aberfan on Saturday was one of a number of events in Merthyr Tydfil county leading up to the anniversary of the disaster on Friday. It started at 11:00 BST when veterans from a number of regiments involved in the rescue operation left Aberfan Community Leisure Centre and marched to the memorial garden, where they laid a wreath. For many members of The King's Own Royal Border Regiment, it was their first time back in the village since 1966. They were able to see how the site of the old school had been transformed into a memorial garden. In October 1966, the soldiers had returned from weekend leave in Devon and answered a call to travel up, with 700 men stepping forward. David Baron, a retired staff sergeant who was a 19-year-old private at the time, described the \\"beautiful scene\\" as they approached Aberfan. But then, he said, he saw the \\"big black line\\" of coal waste running through the village, adding: \\"We suddenly realised it was so quiet because there were no kids around playing.\\" Neil Brennand, who was also a private at the time, said that the regiment helped dig graves and there were \\"grown men crying\\". He added: \\"It never leaves you. I think about it constantly. It scarred your life permanently.\\" About 100 people watched the parade, while flowers were also laid by a number of people, including the local mayor. Many tributes have taken place or are planned around the anniversary, with the Welsh football team visiting the village recently. Another event on Saturday called A Tribute to Aberfan saw schoolchildren from across south Wales perform, led by the Llanelli-based Hywel Girls' Choir and Hywel Boys Singers. They sang Myfanwy in Welsh costumes, with the song left unfinished and a single red rose left on stage in memory of the lost generation of Aberfan. The Hywel choir had begun performing worldwide before the disaster.

The primary goals of the platform are knowledge sharing and promoting discussions, allowing users to learn from one another and engage in productive conversations. The name \\"Quora\\" is derived from \\"Quorum,\\" a Latin term that refers to the minimum number of people required to make decisions or conduct a meeting. In general, a quorum ensures that decisions made are representative of an entire group, rather than just a small subset. Additionally, the word \\"quorum\\" is commonly used in the context of legislative or parliamentary sessions, which involve decision-making, debates, and information sharing among all the members involved. By choosing the name \\"Quora,\\" the platform seeks to embody the concept of a quorum in the context of online knowledge sharing. It represents an online community where people come together, ask questions, share valuable information, and engage in intellectual discussions. The platform aims to establish a space where information is not limited to a small group's knowledge but is openly accessible, widely shared, and mutually beneficial to its users. In summary, the name \\"Quora\\" is a nod to the importance of creating a space where users can access reliable information, engage with others, and help create a valuable repository of knowledge for anyone interested in learning or seeking answers to specific questions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At the Presidio Army base in San Francisco, MP Patti Jean Lynch (Jenette Goldstein) is shot dead while investigating a break-in on the base and two San Francisco Police officers are killed in the getaway. Jay Austin (Mark Harmon), a San Francisco police inspector, is sent to investigate. He clashes with Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell (Sean Connery), the base Provost Marshal. Years ago, Austin and Lynch were partners while serving as MPs and Caldwell was their commanding officer. When Austin arrested Lieutenant Colonel Paul Lawrence (Dana Gladstone), Caldwell didn't support him. In the aftermath, Austin was demoted and decided to leave the army. Austin and Caldwell share a mutual dislike for one another. The murder investigation casts suspicion on Lawrence, as Lynch was killed with a Tokarev, a Russian pistol. Lawrence is the registered owner of a Tokarev, but claims he lost it in a poker game. Austin also learns that the getaway car used by Lynch's killer was registered to a civilian named Arthur Peale (Mark Blum), who is wealthy and owns a holding company that, in turn, owns other companies. Austin tries to question Lawrence about the Tokarev, but Caldwell intervenes. This fuels Austin's suspicions that Caldwell will do anything to protect a fellow officer from civilian authorities, even if he is a killer. Recognizing that part of the case is under Caldwell's jurisdiction at the Presidio and part is under Austin's jurisdiction in San Francisco, they uneasily team up to investigate the case. Caldwell states that if the Tokarev bullet that killed Lynch were to match a bullet fired earlier from Lawrence's Tokarev at the Presidio firing range, then Caldwell will arrange for Lawrence to surrender to Austin for arrest. In the meantime, Caldwell and Austin visit Peale, who claims his car was simply...

After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails.

A business plan should describe, in detail, what your plans for the business are and what you hope to achieve. It should also outline the steps you plan on taking in order to reach your goals. A business plan must include an executive summary, which provides a one-page overview of your goals, as well as a market analysis, company description, description of the product line, funding request, financial projections, and more. Investors include anyone that you know or are somehow networked to who can give you money to start the business. Investors usually become part owners of your business. Lenders, on the other hand, are banks and other financial institutions you let you borrow the money in the form of loans. They do not become part owners, but you do need to pay the money back in time. You will need to contact your state government to apply for a business license/permit and to determine your business's tax status. Every state can determine its own regulations regarding business registration, but at the very least, you can expect to fill out the necessary registration forms and pay some sort of fee. More likely than not, you will end up renting or leasing a building rather than buying the space. Make sure that whatever building you lease is zoned for commercial purposes. If you plan on selling organic food at your organic store, make sure that the building is also zoned for food service purposes. If the building is not zoned properly, you will not be allowed to run an organic shop there. Most businesses do not require additional licenses. However, if organic food is a large part of your proposed stock, your state may require that you purchase a food and beverage license. These licenses can be obtained by your local department of health. You may need to go through a health inspection before you can receive one, however.","output":"A business plan should detail your goals, steps to achieve them, include various sections such as executive summary and market analysis, and consider factors like investors, lenders, licenses/permits, zoning, and potential additional licenses depending on your business's focus."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I have a new situation: Mike is a biochemist, working for a science lab. Today, he has two organisms to investigate, organism A and organism B. He notices that organism A has enzymes, but organism B lacks enzymes. He needs to figure out how these conditions would affect the organisms.  But I can use this background: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes .  What is an answer for this question: Under normal conditions, in which organism the chemical reactions would be more plausible, organism A or organism B? The answer is:","output":"Under normal conditions, the chemical reactions would be more plausible in organism A, because it has enzymes that act as catalysts to speed up the necessary biochemical reactions required for life processes.

Patsy tells her Aunt Trish that it's wrong that they are pick-pocketing people, but Trish believes it's okay in some way, and tells her that they only steal from 'those who can afford it'. Trish's former beau Mel (David Hewlett) comes to the diner to talk to Trish, being chased by two guys to whom he owes money. Trish and Patsy leave to go to Limbers department store. Patsy puts on a blond wig and begins to pick-pocket Mr. Limber (Lawrence Dane), the owner of the store. They are caught by security guard Bert (Mark Ruffalo). Trish and Patsy are brought to the office of Limber and threatened with arrest. But since it is almost Christmas, it's late Friday, and Social Services is already closed, Bert is to keep a watch over them at his place, though he protests doing so. After Christmas, on December 26, he is to return them back to the office, when Patsy is to be given to a foster-family who can better look out for her interests and Trish is to face charges. As the hours go by, Trish and Bert begin to develop an attraction for each other. As Christmas is 'ruined' for Trish and Patsy, Bert takes them to Maplewood for his family's holiday dinner, and then to 'Santa's Castle' where Patsy confesses her bad deeds to Santa's head elf (Howard Hesseman) and writes Santa a note, asking him to deliver her bicycle to Bert's apartment, where they've been staying.

Animals have been killed for their fur and feathers, for food, for sport, and simply because they were in the way. Thousands of kinds of animals have disappeared from the world forever. Hundreds more are on the danger list today. About 170 kinds in the United States alone are considered in danger. Why should people care? Because we need animals. And because once they are gone, there will never be any more. Animals are more than just beautiful and interesting. They are more than just a source of food. Every animal has its place in the balance of nature  . Destroying one kind of animal can create many problems. For example, when farmers killed large numbers of hawks  , the farmers' stores of corn and grain were destroyed by rats and mice. Why? Because hawks eat rats and mice. With no hawks to keep down their numbers, the rats and mice multiplied quickly. Luckily, some people are working to help save the animals. Some groups raise money to let people know about the problem. And they try to get the governments to pass laws protecting animals in danger. Quite a few countries have passed laws. These laws forbid   the killing of any animals or plants on the danger list. Slowly, the number of some animals in danger is growing. Animals are important to us mainly because  _   . A) they give us a source of food B) they are beautiful and lovely C) they keep the balance of nature D) they give us a lot of pleasure Answer:","output":"Animals are important to us mainly because \\"C) they keep the balance of nature\\". This is emphasized in the text through the example of how the extermination of hawks, a predatory bird that keeps down the populations of rodents like rats and mice, led to an explosive increase in the populations of these rodents, which in turn wreaked havoc on the farmers' stores of corn and grain. Animals, be they predators or prey, herbivores or carnivores, terrestrial or aquatic, all have a role to play in maintaining the equilibrium of our ecosystems. When one species is exterminated or its numbers drastically reduced, it upsets this equilibrium, often leading to unforeseen and usually negative consequences elsewhere in the ecosystem. Furthermore, each species contributes to biodiversity, which is critical for a healthy and resilient environment. Hence, the existence and protection of animals is integral to the balance of nature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPTIONS: (i). negative (ii). positive","output":"Based on the given options, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as (i). negative. Although the tweet is not directly displaying a very strong negative emotion, it contains a subtle element of negativity in its tone and content. The phrase \\"smack upside the head\\" implies an aggressive action, which often denotes a form of punishment or disapproval. The tweet seems to be expressing the notion that no such act of aggression (the smack) has occurred, implying that something may have warranted it. Additionally, the context in which the full statement is couched may seem to suggest a sense of disbelief or disappointment. To comprehensively analyze the sentiment in this tweet, here's a breakdown of the text: 1. \\"Not a single smack upside the head?\\" - This question indicates an element of surprise or doubt regarding the lack of a \\"smack.\\" It implies that the user expected a disciplinary action or an unfavorable response, which did not happen. The use of the question format adds to the feeling of curiosity and disbelief, which carries a negative undertone. 2. Phrasal implication - The phrase \\"smack upside the head\\" itself is typically considered negative, as it represents physical aggression or an expression of annoyance. Including such a phrase within a statement heavily suggests that the sentiment is negative. Considering these pieces of evidence, it is clear that the sentiment of the tweet is inclined towards Option (i). negative.

Gravitational Potential Energy is affected by position. Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask?

A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned suggests a situation in which a bird has no materials (sticks, grass, leaves, mud, and spider webs) left to build nests. This scenario would indeed have a direct and indirect effect on the process of creating more or larger nests. Direct effects: 1. Inability to build nests: If the bird has no materials to build nests, it simply cannot initiate or complete the nest-building process. This would prevent the creation of more nests and the expansion of existing nests. 2. Compromised nest quality: The lack of materials would make the bird unable to create sturdy and well-structured nests that can support eggs and provide a suitable environment for raising their offspring. Indirect effects: 1. Reduced breeding success: The inability to create more or larger nests would affect the bird's breeding success, as they would not have adequate space or suitable conditions to lay eggs and raise their offspring. This may result in a decline in the bird's population over time. 2. Changes in nesting behavior: In the face of material scarcity, birds might attempt to adapt by altering their nesting behavior. This could involve seeking alternative materials, resorting to communal nesting, or even choosing different nest sites, such as ground-based locations or man-made structures. 3. Resource competition: The reduced availability of nesting materials may intensify competition between birds for resources, leading to more territorial and aggressive behaviors. This could have ecological consequences, as it may influence the distribution and abundance of different bird species in a given area. In summary, the proposed perturbation would have a direct effect on the process of building more or larger nests, as well as indirect effects on the bird's breeding success, nesting behavior, and resource competition. This scenario emphasizes the importance of the availability of nesting materials for birds and the complex interplay between ecological factors and animal behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There are seven continents in the world. Among them, Antarctica is the most special one. It is a world of snow and ice all year round. China has sent many scientists there. They try to find resources under the icy land and study climate change and sea biology. What do they eat? Scientists don't have many choices on what they eat. About 60% their food is frozen food. It is easy to heat . Meat is common on the menu, while vegetables are not usual. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, people often eat dried and canned vegetables. How do they sleep? In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this time, Antarctica faces the sun and gets sunlight 24 hours of the day. In order to get some sleep,scientists cover the window with black cloth to make \\"night\\". How do they work? People can wear warm clothes to be against the cold weather, but they can do little with the strong wind. Sometimes, the wind is even stronger than a typhoon. It can easily blow people away. So there are ropes that connect some research stations. People can hold these ropes to keep balance in strong winds. How do they keep in touch with others? There are no cables or Internet on the frozen continent. So mobiles and computers don't work there. Scientists usually use two-way radios to communicate at work. If they want to say hello to family and friends, they can use the satellite phones. Question: What do scientists do in Antarctica? Options: A: They mostly study on the animals and plants there. B: They mostly find resources and study climate change and sea biology. C: They mostly find different kinds of lives under the ice and study them. D: They mostly study on the ice and geography. The answer is:","output":"B: They mostly find resources and study climate change and sea biology.  In the given article, it is mentioned that scientists are sent to Antarctica to find resources under the icy land and study climate change and sea biology. Although some aspects of the other options may also be included in their research, option B best sums up the scientists' primary activities in Antarctica.  Climate change is a major area of focus for researchers as it has far-reaching consequences on global weather patterns and sea levels, affecting ecosystems and human societies alike. By studying climate change and sea biology, scientists aim to better understand the effects of global warming on ocean ecosystems, which in turn can provide insights into ways to mitigate or adapt to the changing environment. Additionally, the exploration of resources under the icy land can have significant implications for discovering valuable minerals, oil and gas deposits, and other vital materials that could have economic and technological benefits. This allows nations and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about the potential development and exploitation of resources in the region, while considering environmental preservation and sustainable practices. In conclusion, while the work of scientists in Antarctica might cover a broad range of fields, their main focus mentioned in the article revolves around finding resources and studying climate change and sea biology, which is best represented by option B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some of the other reviews point out how dumb Detention is, but many neglect to point out the positives.  Any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed can't be all bad. Why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens? Aren't there any other kind of teens? Does every group of teens have one angry black guy? One genius nerd that nobody likes? One slutty girl who is very friendly and (in this movie) pregnant? One disturbed anti-social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented (but what is the talent?). And one laid-back black kid who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him. Then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color. They don't say much but get shot at some point.  Detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school. Preferably with the writers inside. The dialogue is bad, and the plot is worse. When the bad guys (and girl) finally hijack a van full of drugs, then they sit inside the van making out. They drive the van to the school because they want to re-paint the van at the school's paint shop, but they never get around to re-painting the van. By the way, it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the Police Van. They also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score.  For some reason, they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren) even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours. The handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles, so why go after them?  Anyhow, the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns, and they keep finding the teens (including a guy in a wheel chair) and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss. Towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed. For every time someone gets shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss. The stunts are pretty bad.  I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of 10 Million, and I am amazed.

She examined the situation closely and considered her options for making the marble fit into the cap. Step 1: Assess the size difference She held the marble next to the pen cap to see how much bigger it was compared to the opening. She noted that the difference was only a few millimeters. This gave her hope that she could find a way to make it fit. Step 2: Consider the tools available She looked around her workspace and saw several items that could potentially be useful: a small file, sandpaper, a pair of pliers, and a small hammer. Step 3: Evaluate the risks and benefits of each tool She considered each tool's potential risks and benefits: - The file could be used to gradually shave down the marble, but it would require a lot of time and effort to get the right size. - Sandpaper might work, but it could take even longer than the file and would create a lot of dust. - The pliers might be useful for holding the marble steady while she worked on it, but wouldn't help with actually altering the marble's size. - Finally, the hammer could potentially crack or chip the marble to make it smaller, but there was a significant risk of damaging the marble or making it too small. Step 4: Choose the best tool After evaluating the risks and benefits, she decided that the file offered the best balance between safety and effectiveness. Step 5: Prepare the work area Before she began filing the marble, she put on a pair of safety goggles to protect her eyes, and laid a cloth down on the table to catch the marble shavings. Step 6: File the marble Using the file, she carefully shaved down the marble in a circular motion, periodically checking the size against the pen cap. She made sure to file in a consistent manner to maintain the marble's rounded shape. Step 7: Test the fit After she had filed the marble down enough to fit into the pen cap, she tested it by gently pressing the pen cap onto the marble. It fit snugly and securely. She tried rolling the marble in the cap to ensure that the fit was stable and correct. Step 8: Clean up Satisfied with her work, she carefully wiped away the marble shavings from the table and disposed of them in the trash.

First off, it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works. Some have, as Kubrick did with \\"Lolita\\", gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work. Of course that can't happen here; Kraft-Ebing is long dead. Some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new, unrelated direction (the recent adaptation of \\"Tristram Shandy\\" comes to mind here). You can dumb it down - the film of \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is to my mind an example of that. Or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes. That would be the approach of Woody Allen's \\"Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex\\", and, arguably, this film. Upon consideration, it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like \\"Psychopathia Sexualis\\". The potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed. And so it is here. Point two is the cinematic style. Some would call it an \\"homage\\" to Murnau, Pabst, Carl Dreyer, etc., but I think it more crude than that. Its far too heavy handed and self-conscious to be effective for long. It is eventually just annoying. Point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation. How did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring? I found the film impossible to pay attention to, and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well. I don't want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless, but I have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material, the overt copying of filmic styles, and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level (possibly for fear of being accused of titillation). The film is a dubious exercise from the start and doesn't really work for me, I'm sorry to say.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. Given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a new ending, the task is to generate the counterfactual context that is aligned with the new ending. Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story. And a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. To sum up, you should write the second sentence of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the new ending(last three sentences) of the story. Premise: Jim mouthed off to a fella who'd just gotten out of prison.   Initial Context: The fella had a short temper and got pretty angry real quick.   Original Ending: Jim kept up his trash talking. The fella beat Jim up so much he ended up in a coma and then died. The fella's going back to jail for violating his parole.   New ending: Jim kept up his trash talking. Jim beat up the felon so much he ended up in a coma and then died. Jim is going to jail for violating the law.  Output:","output":"The task is asking you to create a counterfactual context for a story, given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a new ending. Your goal is to write a new second sentence that connects the premise with the new ending. Here are the simple steps to achieve this: 1. Read the premise, which is the first sentence of the story. 2. Understand the original context, which is the second sentence of the story. 3. Analyze the original ending, which is the last three sentences of the story. 4. Study the new ending provided, and notice the differences between the original and new endings. 5. Write a counterfactual context (a new second sentence) that connects the premise and the new ending coherently. For the given example: Premise: Jim mouthed off to a fella who'd just gotten out of prison. New ending: Jim kept up his trash talking. Jim beat up the felon so much he ended up in a coma and then died. Jim is going to jail for violating the law. In this case, you need to create a new second sentence that explains why Jim, instead of the fella, would end up winning the fight in the new ending. One possible counterfactual context could be: Counterfactual Context: To Jim's surprise, the fella was not as strong as he looked and was out of shape after being in prison. So, the revised story would be: 1. Jim mouthed off to a fella who'd just gotten out of prison. 2. To Jim's surprise, the fella was not as strong as he looked and was out of shape after being in prison. 3. Jim kept up his trash talking. 4. Jim beat up the felon so much he ended up in a coma and then died. 5. Jim is going to jail for violating the law."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
