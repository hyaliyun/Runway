He also has the company of long-time best friend Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and his wife Jackie (Julianne White). Their serene life is shattered by the arrival of an old criminal associate, the sociopathic Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), who is intent on enlisting Gal in a bank heist back in London. Organising the heist is Teddy Bass (Ian McShane), a powerful crime lord, who has learned about the bank's vault from Harry (James Fox), the bank's chairman whom he met at an orgy. Gal politely but firmly declines Logan's many demands to join the heist, but Logan will not back down. After revealing an obsessive infatuation with Jackie, Logan also makes several unwelcome attempts at reconnecting with her. Logan eventually grows furious, hurling torrents of verbal abuse at the group while at the same time spitefully painting himself as a victim of their betrayal. After storming away in a rage, Logan boards a plane back to London, only to be kicked off for refusing to put out his cigarette. Seething with hatred, Logan returns to Gal's home with menacing intentions, hitting a glass beer bottle into Gal's ear. DeeDee shoots Logan with a shotgun, incapacitating him. The four friends join in their efforts to kill him, first beating him, stamping on him, shooting him again, and finally crushing his skull. Hoping to cover up Logan's murder, Gal returns to London to perform the job. When asked by Bass about Logan's whereabouts, Gal feigns ignorance and claims Logan had called him \\"from Heathrow\\". However, Bass is visibly suspicious, and Gal's anxieties mount. During the heist, Bass' crew use surface-supplied diving gear to drill into Harry's bank vault from a pool in a neighbouring bath house.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to analyze whether the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise, let's first break down the statement and identify the key elements. Premise: \\"We both looked ridiculous.\\" In this statement, \\"we both\\" refers to two people (the speaker and another person), and \\"looked ridiculous\\" describes their appearance. Altogether, the statement claims that they had absurd or foolish appearances. Hypothesis: \\"It was only I who looked ridiculous.\\" Here, \\"only I\\" refers to the speaker exclusively, and \\"looked ridiculous\\" still refers to an absurd or foolish appearance. The hypothesis proposes that only the speaker looked ridiculous, whereas the other person did not have that appearance. Now, let's evaluate if the hypothesis can be concluded based on the premise. According to the premise, both individuals seemed ridiculous. This establishes that at least one of them, the speaker, looked ridiculous. However, it does not imply that the other person did not look ridiculous. Here is a counter-example to test this hypothesis: Consider a scenario where two friends, Alice and Bob, are attending a costume party. Alice is wearing an outfit that has bright colors and oversized shoes, making her look ridiculous. Bob is wearing an outfit featuring a unicorn onesie, which also makes him appear ridiculous. In this case, the premise is true because they both (Alice and Bob) look ridiculous. However, the hypothesis claims that only Alice (assuming Alice is the speaker) looked ridiculous. This would mean that Bob did not look ridiculous, which contradicts the original premise. In this scenario, the hypothesis cannot follow from the premise. In conclusion, based on the given information, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The premise establishes that both individuals looked ridiculous, but the hypothesis suggests that only the speaker looked ridiculous and the other person did not. This claim cannot be substantiated by the premise alone, as the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:Cristian Diaz, 35, who is from Spain but was living in Enniskillen, admitted carrying out the Lakeland Forum attacks in February and March 2015. He approached the children - aged nine, 10 and 11 - on three separate occasions while they were swimming. A judge said the offences had taken place in a \\"public arena\\" and had involved children of a \\"tender age\\". He said the swimming pool was a place \\"where the children should have been able to feel safe and where parents allow them to go in safety\\". He said the attacks had left the girls \\"understandably confused, distressed and upset at what happened to them\\". A prosecution lawyer told Dungannon Crown Court that following one of the assaults, Diaz, told the child he was \\"sorry\\" but they were too shocked to reply and swam away. The incidents were reported to the police who then identified Diaz from CCTV footage. A defence lawyer said Diaz was a graduate of Madrid University who had been working in Europe as an electrical engineer, before moving to Enniskillen in order to improve his English. His address was given as East Bridge Street in the town. \\"The accused accepts the three complainants were bound to be frightened, stressed and suffer as a result of his actions and for what it's worth he's asked me to apologise for his actions,\\" said the lawyer.

Cast off.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Art of Casting On, Knitting, and Casting Off in the World of Knitting Introduction: Knitting is a relaxing, productive, and creative art form that has been practiced for centuries across various cultures. It is an excellent way for both, beginners and experienced individuals, to create comfortable clothing items, warm blankets, and beautiful decorative pieces. While knitting may seem complex to some, it is ultimately a seamless process that can be divided into three simple stages: casting on, knitting to the desired length, and casting off. This article will delve into the world of knitting, providing a detailed explanation of these vital stages, providing tips for success and elaborating on how to take your knitting projects to the next level. 1. Casting On: Before you can begin knitting, it is crucial to cast on your project, which provides a foundation row of stitches upon which the rest of the piece will be built. Here is a step-by-step guide to casting on: a. Start by making a slipknot with your chosen yarn. Leave a long tail to ensure there is enough yarn to create your foundation row. b. Slip the loop onto a knitting needle, with the slipknot counting as your first stitch. c. Hold the needle with the slipknot in your right hand. Use your left hand to hold the yarn in a way that the tail is towards you and the working yarn is away from you. d. Create a loop with the yarn by dipping your left thumb and index finger between the working yarn and tail, spreading the strands apart.  e. Bring the needle under and through the loop on your thumb, then over the yarn on your index finger. Pull the needle through the thumb loop.  f. Remove your thumb from the loop, tighten, and repeat steps d-e until you have the desired number of stitches on your needle.  Tip: When casting on, ensure that your stitches are loose enough to work with, but not too loose that they unravel easily. Maintain consistent tension when creating stitches to maintain evenness throughout your work. 2. Knit to Desired Length: Once the foundation row is set, the process of knitting begins, following a designated pattern or stitch type to achieve the desired look. a. Hold the needle with the cast-on stitches in your left hand, and use an empty one in your right hand. b. Insert the right needle into the first stitch from left to right, under the left needle. The right needle should now be at the back of the left needle. c. With the working yarn at the back, bring it over the right needle, between the two needles. d. Pull the right needle (now in front) through the stitch on the left needle, while holding the right-hand needle under the left-hand needle. You've just created a new stitch on the right-hand needle. e. Slip the old stitch from the left needle and repeat steps b-e until all stitches have been transferred between the needles. f. Continue knitting rows, making sure to maintain correct tension and consistent stitches, until your project reaches the desired length. Tip: Add stitch markers if you're using a pattern with multiple stitch types or if you are knitting in the round. Also, consider utilizing different stitch types to add texture and visual appeal to your project. 3. Casting Off: Once your knitting project has reached the desired length, it is time to cast off, securing the stitches and ensuring a smooth, finished edge. a. Begin by knitting the first two stitches of your final row. b. With the left needle, insert it into the second stitch on the right needle, lifting it up and over the first stitch and off the needle. c. Knit another stitch and repeat step b until only one stitch remains on your right needle. d. Cut the yarn, leaving a tail long enough to weave in.  e. Pull the cut yarn through the final stitch to secure it, and remove the needle. Weave in your ends for a clean, polished appearance. Tip: While casting off, maintain a tension similar to your knitting tension to avoid a tight or irregular edge. If desired, use a larger needle size to cast off to achieve a looser finish. Conclusion: Knitting is an art form that allows you to create beautiful, functional, and personalized items. Taking the time to properly understand casting on, knitting, and casting off will enhance the quality of your projects and improve your overall knitting experience. Practice and determination are key to improving your knitting skills and expanding your repertoire of knitting techniques. So, grab your needles and yarn, and dive into the wonderful world of knitting to create cozy garments, luxurious blankets, and stunning accessories all crafted by your hands."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose work was dismissed by some critics? is inside the article: Nixon in China is an opera in three acts by John Adams, with a libretto by Alice Goodman. Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip. To create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action. Following the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company. Recent critical opinion has tended to recognize the work as a significant and lasting contribution to American opera., can you guess it ?

The tweet is directed at a specific user (@HeyAmaretto). It's common to mention another user when the tweet is intended for them, which can be a way of interacting with or supporting them.   2. The phrase \\"since you wanted original earworms\\" suggests that the sender of the tweet is offering something the recipient desired, which is more likely to have a positive connotation.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? bucket","output":"The goal mentioned is to complete a \\"bucket list\\" which is a list of experiences, achievements, or life goals that an individual wants to fulfill in their lifetime. Accomplishing a bucket list can be an extremely significant and personal journey. Here are some steps to help someone go about accomplishing their bucket list: 1. Define your bucket list: First, take some time to think about what you want to accomplish in your life. Be honest with yourself and consider what brings you joy and fulfillment. Reflect on your interests, passions, and the impact you want to have on the world. Your bucket list should be personal and unique to you. 2. Write your list down: Writing down your bucket list will help to solidify your intentions and make the list feel more real. It can also make it easier to evaluate and reassess your goals as you progress. Be specific about your goals and consider organizing them into categories, such as personal growth, travel, adventure, career, relationships, health, and cultural experiences. 3. Create actionable steps: Break down each goal into smaller, actionable steps that will help you achieve it. For example, if one of your goals is to travel to a specific destination, the steps may include researching the best time to visit, saving money for the trip, obtaining necessary travel documents, and booking accommodations. 4. Prioritize and set deadlines: Not all bucket list items carry the same level of importance, so prioritize them according to your values and interests. Then, set realistic deadlines for achieving each goal. Deadlines will help keep you accountable and focused on making steady progress. 5. Develop a plan of action: Once you know what goals you want to accomplish and when, create a detailed plan of action. This plan should include the resources you will need, such as finances or expertise, and any challenges you anticipate facing. Your plan of action should also outline the actionable steps you defined in step 3, along with their deadlines. 6. Get started and stay committed: Begin working on your bucket list by tackling the items you are most passionate about or those that are time-sensitive. Remember to be patient and persistent in your efforts, and don't be afraid to reassess your goals and make adjustments as needed. 7. Celebrate your achievements: As you accomplish items on your bucket list, take the time to celebrate your successes. Reflect on the growth and experiences you've gained along the way, and share your progress with friends and family. 8. Stay inspired: Maintaining motivation is integral to achieving your bucket list. Constantly remind yourself of the reasons why you created the list and the benefits you will gain from accomplishing your goals. Surround yourself with positive people who support your journey and seek out inspiration from books, movies, and other sources. 9. Revisit and revise your list: As your life changes, your bucket list should evolve to reflect your current values, desires, and circumstances. Periodically revisit your list and consider adding new goals or modifying existing ones. 10. Help others with their bucket lists: Sharing your experiences and knowledge with others can be incredibly rewarding and can help to strengthen your commitment to your own goals. Get involved in group activities, volunteer opportunities, or online communities, where you can offer guidance and support to others pursuing their bucket lists. Remember, the purpose of having a bucket list is to make the most of your life by pursuing meaningful experiences and personal growth. It's important to enjoy the journey, stay flexible, and be open to change while working towards your aspirations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on... Answer:","output":"The real names of the men who helped add a \\"more analogue sound\\" to the song \\"Galang\\" previously recorded by M.I.A are Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, collectively known as the Cavemen. These two professionals collaborated with M.I.A. in a studio setting, enhancing the initial version of the song, which was created using the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine and a basic four-track tape recorder, by adding a bass line and new vocals to achieve a richer and more analogue sound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well. President Barack Obama has set... Question: who was behind Obama's decision to resettle refugees === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"President Barack Obama's decision to resettle refugees in the United States was influenced by a combination of factors, including humanitarian concerns, international obligations, and policy recommendations from various government departments and agencies. 1. Humanitarian concerns: The ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, Iraq, and Libya, have resulted in millions of people being forcibly displaced from their homes. As a global leader, the United States has a responsibility to help address this humanitarian crisis by providing assistance to refugees, including offering resettlement opportunities. 2. International obligations: The United States is a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which defines a refugee and outlines the rights and protections afforded to them. By agreeing to resettle refugees, the United States is fulfilling its obligations under international law and demonstrating its commitment to protecting vulnerable populations. 3. Government departments and agencies: Various U.S. government departments and agencies have provided input and recommendations on refugee resettlement. The Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within the Department of Health and Human Services are all involved in the process of resettling refugees in the United States. These agencies work together to identify, screen, and assist refugees throughout the resettlement process. In summary, President Obama's decision to resettle refugees was influenced by a combination of humanitarian concerns, international obligations, and policy recommendations from various government departments and agencies. The goal of this decision was to provide aid to those fleeing conflicts and persecution while upholding the United States' commitment to human rights and global leadership."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Invincible was release October 30, 2001 by Epic Records.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the album \\"Invincible\\" was released on October 30, 2001, by Epic Records. This information is supported by the initial statement provided, which gives a clear and concise detail of the album's release date and record label. \\"Invincible,\\" as mentioned earlier, is the final studio album by the legendary American recording artist, Michael Jackson. It was also his sixth studio album released through Epic Records, one of the leading music labels that have played a significant role in shaping Michael Jackson's illustrious career. \\"Invincible\\" showcased Jackson's continued artistic growth and mastery of his craft, while also addressing a wide range of themes in its lyrics, such as love, romance, isolation, media criticism, and social issues. The album features a diverse range of musical styles and genres, illustrating Jackson's broad musical influences and his adaptability to contemporary sounds. Several producers, including Rodney Jerkins, Teddy Riley, and Michael himself, contributed their talents to crafting the album's unique sonic palette. \\"Invincible\\" debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 363,000 copies in the United States in its first week. Although \\"Invincible\\" did not achieve the same level of commercial success as some of Jackson's previous albums, such as \\"Thriller\\" or \\"Bad,\\" it still stands as an important testament to his undeniable artistry and creativity. Unfortunately, \\"Invincible\\" would be the last full studio album released during his lifetime, as Jackson tragically passed away on June 25, 2009. In summary, we can definitively conclude that \\"Invincible\\" was released on October 30, 2001, by Epic Records, marking the final studio album produced by the iconic Michael Jackson before his untimely passing. The album, while not as commercially successful as previous efforts, remains a significant and compelling addition to Jackson's exceptional body of work, showcasing his eternal devotion to his craft, passion for innovation, and his ability to connect deeply with his audience through the exploration of universal themes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: That's all from us today, a day that began with a violent end to the 16 hour siege that held 17 people captive, and ended with a city united in mourning.      Thousands covered Martin Place in flowers and thousands have written notes of condolence on pieces of paper that the NSW Goverment has pledged they will bind together into books.      We celebrated the lives of the two hostages who died, Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson. And we learned about the 15 survivors who came from all walks of life but will be bounded by this tragedy.      Also today, we learned more about gunman Man Horan Moris while Prime Minister Tony Abbott faced questions about why someone known to the Australian Federal Police and ASIO was not on the terror watch list.      Rick Feneley has written what is known so far about the siege here.      About 9.30am on Monday, barristers Katrina Dawson and Julie Taylor popped into the Lindt Chocolat Cafe. The pair worked together in commercial law, around the corner at the prestigious Eight Selborne Chambers next to the Supreme Court.      Ms Dawson, a 38-year-old mother of three young children, and Ms Taylor, pregnant, were among nine customers and eight staff inside that small cafe in Martin Place. They were there with Stefan Balafoutis, another young member of the NSW bar, from the 10th Floor Selborne/Wentworth Chambers.      There were some familiar faces in the crowded room: Elly Chen, their smiling barista, a 22-year-old student from the University of NSW; Tori Johnson, the cafe's affable 34-year-old manager.      They would not have recognised 30-year-old Harriette Denny, visiting Sydney from the Sunshine Coast. A 75-year-old woman was also among the customers.      Then, through the cafe's automatic glass sliding doors, entered a bearded 50-year-old man. This was Man Haron Monis. He was wearing a bandanna and carrying a blue bag that contained a shotgun.      Read the rest here. ||||| Story highlights The hostages who died are identified as Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson      All of those injured are described by police in stable condition      \\"It will take time to clarify exactly what happened ... and why,\\" PM says      The gunman's social media postings reflect a radical Sunni extremist theology      The deadly siege of a central Sydney cafe has ended but the investigation is just beginning.      Australian authorities stormed the cafe where a self-styled Muslim cleric had been holding hostages early Tuesday, killing the gunman. They moved in some 16 hours after the siege began, after hearing gunfire inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe, New South Wales police Commissioner Andrew P. Scipione told reporters.      Two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died, according to Scipione. They were later identified as Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34. Other people were injured, including a police officer who suffered a wound to the face from gunshot pellets. All were described by police to be in stable condition.      \\"Understandably, there is a lot of speculation, but it will take time to clarify exactly what happened ... and why,\\" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters Tuesday.      Man Haron Monis.      What did the gunman want? Why did he choose the cafe as his target?      \\"There is nothing more Australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee, and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident,\\" Abbott said.      He offered his condolences to people caught in the attack and to their loved ones.      \\"These events do demonstrate that even a country as free as open as generous and as safe as ours is vulnerable to acts of politically motivated violence,\\" the Prime Minister said. \\"But they also remind us that Australia, and Australians are resilient and we are ready to respond.\\"      Gunman had violent history      JUST WATCHED Australian PM: Hearts go out to hostages Replay More Videos ...

Abbott told reporters that the gunman was already well-known to authorities, and that he had a \\"long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability.\\"      Before the raid, Monis had demanded a flag and phone call with Abbott, CNN affiliate Sky News Australia reported. He made the demands through hostages who contacted media organizations, Sky News reported.      Some hostages had also reportedly posted messages to social networking sites and the YouTube online video service. Police urged media early Tuesday not to show the videos.      Monis, also known as Sheikh Haron, pleaded guilty in 2013 to writing letters to relatives of Australian service members saying they were \\"Hitler's soldiers,\\" according to Australian media reports.      He was believed to be acting alone, and he didn't appear to be part of a broader plot, additional U.S. law enforcement and intelligence sources said.

After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Which country would have lower labor supply in response to their taxation?  Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. A:","output":"France would have a lower labor supply in response to their taxation policies since they implemented a tax rate above the critical rate. According to the Laffer curve, this would result in a decline in labor supply."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is true about the mother Options: - She wants the teacher to be fired - She wants the best for her daughter - not enough information - She wants to report the principal to the school board Answer:","output":"She wants the best for her daughter"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some kids love the spotlight and would enjoy being a part of as many aspects of the ceremony and reception as possible. Other kids may want to take supporting roles. Once you have decided on the basics of your ceremony and reception, sit the kids down and ask them what they might like to do.  Tell them your basic ideas for the ceremony, and which parts of the ceremony you would like them to participate in. Be sure to explain traditional wedding roles (like the wedding party, ushers, or flower girls) if they aren’t aware of them. You could say, “I would like all of the kids to play a part in the wedding ceremony in some way. What kind of things do you think you would like to do in our wedding?” Get their ideas. Ask the kids for their ideas about things they could do at the ceremony or reception. Try to incorporate at least one suggestion from each child. For example, your children may have food preferences or want cupcakes instead of cake. You could choose to have a cupcake station at your reception instead of a traditional wedding cake. If they are old enough, have them look at wedding websites for ways kids can be a part of a wedding. Remember, they did not fall in love with your spouse-to-be, you did. They may not be as excited for the wedding as you are. Try to understand where they are coming from, and do not force them to do something they may not want to. It may build resentment and make you get off to a rough start with your new, blended family.  Figure out what, if any, wedding activities you want your child or future stepchild to participate in, and let them know your expectations. If the child is unwilling to participate, talk to them and try to understand why. You could say, “I understand that you’re still upset that your dad and I divorced, and you don’t want me marrying Michael. You don’t have to participate in the ceremony if you don’t want to, but I want you to be at the wedding handing out programs, and I want you to participate in the family dance at the reception.” Give the kids some power and delegate responsibility. Give them control over an aspect of the wedding you think they can handle and don’t mind delegating. For example, you could let them choose:  Themes. You could ask the kids to choose a symbol that represents your new family, that could be incorporated into your wedding invitations, centerpieces, or favors. Maybe all of you love to go fishing and camping, and you could create your wedding with an outdoor theme, for example. Colors. You could also ask the kids to decide what colors will be a part of your wedding. If there are kids from both you and your spouse-to-be, you could let each side of the family choose one color. Use both colors in your wedding as a representation of your families coming together. Ceremony programs. Older kids could design a program on the computer, or they could draw a picture to be used on the cover. Most children could help you fold or assemble them, as well. The menu. Have your children help you select the kids’ menu at your reception. You could even take them along to your tasting to help you make decisions! Favors. Involve them in creating the favors that guest will take home with them. Older kids may even be able to handle selecting the favors and assembling them with minimal supervision. Their outfits. For example, you could let your stepdaughter-to-be select her flower girl dress (you could narrow down her choices to two or three) and shoes. If you are hiring a photographer to shoot your wedding, make sure they take lots of family portraits and have experience working with kids. It will help send the message to everyone that they are part of the family. You will also have lots of beautiful family photos from your special day.  Talk to the kids about any fun photos they would like to take on the wedding, and make sure the photographer tries to incorporate their suggestions. If you are taking engagement pictures before the wedding, include some pictures with the kids as well. If you have a budding photographer or videographer in your family, consider giving that child a camera to help document the wedding. If it’s feasible and within your budget, let your kids each invite a few close friends to the wedding. They will have a lot of fun with their friends, and it helps them celebrate their new family, as well as the two of you. Be clear of your expectations ahead of time. For example, you may want your family to sit together during dinner, and the kids may have other responsibilities during the ceremony or reception that will take away from time with their friends. Before or after the wedding, plan to do something special with your new spouse and kids to help everyone bond and relax. Get their input on a special activity or getaway.  For older kids, you could let them do some research. You could say, “We would like to do a weekend trip with all of the kids after the wedding. Here’s our budget. Could you help us by making a list of places we could go with that amount of money?” For younger kids, you could say, “Next weekend we want to go somewhere special with our whole family. Where would you like to go, to the zoo or the children’s museum?” Summary:","output":"Incorporate children into your wedding by discussing their preferred roles, considering their ideas and preferences, giving them responsibility over certain aspects like themes or favors, and providing opportunities for family bonding and celebrating the new family unit."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his compositional style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, the music of all of whom he admired, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.

Pick your answer from:  *you can use a broom to push the dirt under the furniture so you don't see it..  *you can scoop the dirt on a piece of paper and throw it outside.....I think the answer is","output":"The more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of cleaning dirt off the floor is to scoop the dirt on a piece of paper and throw it outside. There are a few reasons why this is a better choice compared to using a broom to push the dirt under the furniture. 1. Thorough cleaning: By scooping the dirt onto a piece of paper and disposing of it outside, you are effectively removing the dirt from the floor and your living space. This ensures that the area is clean and any allergens, germs, or particles in the dirt are no longer present in your environment. 2. Prevention of future cleaning issues: When you push dirt under the furniture with a broom, you are only hiding the problem temporarily. Eventually, the dirt will accumulate and may lead to more significant cleaning tasks in the future. By removing the dirt from the room, you prevent this accumulation and promote a cleaner living space. 3. No risk of damage to furniture or floor: By pushing dirt under the furniture, there is a risk of scratching your floor or damaging the furniture. When you remove the dirt completely, you avoid these risks and protect your belongings. 4. Improved air quality: The presence of dirt and dust can impact the air quality in your living space. By removing the dirt from your floor and disposing of it outside, you will improve the air quality in your home and create a healthier environment for you and your family. 5. Sense of accomplishment: Ultimately, scooping the dirt onto a piece of paper and throwing it outside is a more satisfying method of cleaning because it demonstrates that you are taking meaningful action to maintain a clean living space. Choosing to only push the dirt under furniture may result in feelings of guilt or dissatisfaction with your efforts. In conclusion, while both methods can temporarily improve the appearance of your floor, scooping the dirt onto a piece of paper and disposing of it outside is the more reasonable method for achieving your goal of cleaning dirt off the floor. This approach ensures a cleaner living environment, prevents future cleaning issues, protects your belongings from damage, and offers you a sense of accomplishment in maintaining your home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In an effort to understand the factors contributing to this concerning trend, researchers at the University of Stirling have been studying the exposure of children to junk food marketing. Their findings reveal alarming amounts of such marketing materials targeting young consumers, raising questions on the need for stricter regulations to protect children from unhealthy food choices. Children's vulnerability to junk food advertising Children are particularly susceptible to the influence of marketing due to their limited understanding of advertising intent. As a result, they can be easily swayed by attractive marketing materials and promotions geared towards their age group. The University of Stirling's study highlights the importance of examining the potential impact of junk food marketing on children's eating habits in order to address the issue of childhood obesity. Scope and methodology of the study The University of Stirling's research team focused on evaluating the prevalence of junk food marketing in the media that is frequently accessed by children. This included television shows, online platforms, and radio programs, among others. Through a systematic and comprehensive analysis, researchers sought to quantify the frequency and types of marketing materials encountered by these young consumers. Alarming findings and their implications The study revealed that children are being exposed to concerning amounts of junk food marketing. Various tactics such as celebrity endorsements, catchy tunes, colorful visuals, and the use of animated characters are employed by marketers to appeal to this vulnerable demographic. This concerning situation poses several implications for children’s health. Exposure to such marketing materials can result in increased consumption of unhealthy foods that are high in fat, sugar, and salt. Over time, unhealthy eating habits can contribute to the development of chronic health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Calls for stricter regulations and interventions Given the study's findings, there is an urgent need for stricter regulations and interventions that limit the exposure of children to junk food marketing. Possible steps include administering stricter guidelines on advertising content and placement to reduce children's exposure, implementation of advertising bans during children's television programming, and reducing the number of digital advertisements on websites and social media platforms frequented by children. Additionally, efforts should be made to increase the promotion of healthy food options to children. Educational programs and campaigns aimed at raising awareness about the importance of good nutrition and the dangers of consuming unhealthy foods could be implemented in schools and communities. Conclusion The University of Stirling's study offers an alarming insight into the world of junk food marketing and its potential impact on children's health. It is imperative that policymakers, health professionals, and parents take action to protect children from being exposed to harmful marketing tactics that can lead to unhealthy eating habits and long-term health issues. Understanding the extent of the problem is the first step in implementing effective strategies to create a healthier environment for future generations."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The story opens on the night of December 6, 1941, at a dance in the Officers' Club at Pearl Harbor.

When the band launches into an upbeat swing tune, Liz engages in an exotic dance that for better or for worse draws the attention of every person in the club. Mac finally asks the band to make an end and play something else, which is heeded to Liz's disappointment.

Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech... Answer:","output":"Smetana's piece is now called the Festive Symphony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: If one is a mechanic, what are they likely to work with? - washing a car - oil engine - servicing airplane - machine parts - machine tool  The best answer is A:","output":"If one is a mechanic, they are likely to work with a variety of tasks and tools related to the maintenance, repair, and servicing of vehicles and machinery. While a mechanic's specific tasks may vary depending on their specialization and work setting, some common tasks they may perform include washing a car, working with oil engines, servicing airplanes, handling machine parts, and using machine tools. Below is a more detailed explanation of what a mechanic might do for each of these tasks. 1. Washing a car: While washing a car may not seem like the most technical aspect of a mechanic's job, it can be an essential step in ensuring that a vehicle looks its best and runs smoothly. Washing a car can involve cleaning the exterior using soap, water, and specialized brushes, as well as vacuuming and wiping down the interior. This task may also include cleaning the engine bay to remove dirt and debris, which can help a mechanic inspect and work on the various components more easily. 2. Oil engine: An oil engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, plays a critical role in powering most vehicles and machinery. A mechanic who works with oil engines will need to understand the principles of combustion, as well as the many components involved, such as spark plugs, pistons, valves, and shafts. They may perform regular maintenance on these engines, like changing the oil, replacing filters, and checking for wear or damage. Additionally, they may diagnose and repair a range of engine-related issues, from leaks and noisy operation to performance problems and total engine failure. 3. Servicing airplane: Aviation mechanics, or aircraft technicians, specialize in the maintenance, repair, and inspection of aircraft. This can involve working on engines, landing gear, electrical systems, and other components essential to flight. Servicing an airplane may require performing routine maintenance, such as checking fluid levels, testing systems, and cleaning and lubricating parts. It can also involve diagnosing and repairing issues that could hinder an aircraft's safe operation, like corrosion, worn or damaged components, or system failures. Aviation mechanics must be meticulous and follow strict regulations to ensure aircraft are safe and reliable. 4. Machine parts: Mechanics may work with a wide array of machine parts, from engines and transmissions to suspension systems and exhausts. They may need to diagnose issues, disassemble and reassemble components, and perform repairs or replacements as needed. On a given day, a mechanic might handle brake pads, fuel pumps, timing belts, or countless other parts critical to a vehicle's or machine's operation. These professionals need to be skilled in interpreting technical manuals, using diagnostic equipment, and working with precision tools to ensure proper fit and function. 5. Machine tool: In the course of maintaining and repairing vehicles and machinery, mechanics must be proficient in using an array of machine tools, including wrenches, pliers, screwdrivers, and specialized equipment like torque wrenches, engine analyzers, and hydraulic presses. They may also employ diagnostic tools like multimeters and oscilloscopes to identify electrical issues or software tools to troubleshoot and update onboard systems. Being adept with various machine tools allows mechanics to efficiently and safely perform their duties while maximizing the longevity and performance of the vehicles and equipment they service. In summary, a mechanic is likely to work with a diverse range of tasks and tools that may include washing cars, handling oil engines, servicing airplanes, working with machine parts, and using machine tools. The best answer here would be to emphasize that a mechanic's work can span across multiple areas and requires a versatile skill set to diagnose, maintain, and repair an assortment of vehicles and machinery."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

North Sister, also known as \\"Faith\\", is the oldest and most highly eroded of the three, with zigzagging rock pinnacles between glaciers. It is a shield volcano that overlays a more ancient shield volcano named Little Brother. North Sister is 5 miles (8 km) wide, and its summit elevation is 10,090 feet (3,075 m). Consisting primarily of basaltic andesite, it has a more mafic composition than the other two volcanoes. Its deposits are rich in palagonite and red and black cinders, and they are progressively more iron-rich the younger they are. North Sister's lava flows demonstrate similar compositions throughout the mountain's long eruptive history. The oldest lava flows on North Sister have been dated to roughly 311,000 years ago, though the oldest reliably dated deposits are approximately 119,000 years old. Estimates place the volcano's last eruption at 46,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene.North Sister possesses more dikes than any similar Cascade peak, caused by lava intruding into pre-existing rocks.

Write an article based on this summary: – One big factor in a deadly fire at Trump Tower over the weekend in New York City is drawing a lot of attention: The 50th-floor apartment that burned had no sprinkler system, though that was perfectly legal. The city passed a law requiring sprinklers in high-rises in 1999, but only for new buildings, explains the AP. Because Trump Tower went up in 1983, it didn't need to comply. Trump was among the developers who opposed the 1999 law as too expensive, arguing that it would add 4 per square foot to an apartment. As the New York Post reported in 1999, he personally called council members to lobby against the measure. The opposition affected the final version of the legislation, allowing older buildings to be grandfathered in, per the Washington Post. However, Trump also made a move at the time that went above and beyond the new law. He decided to spend an extra 3 million to add sprinklers to Trump World Tower, then under construction. Legally, he didn't need to do so under the law. \\"People feel safer with sprinklers,\\" he told the New York Times back then. \\"But the problem with the bill is that it doesn’t address the buildings that need sprinklers the most.

One of the central points of discussion arising from the disaster concerns the fact that the 50th-floor apartment, which was almost completely burnt in the fire, did not have a sprinkler system installed. Although this was perfectly legal under the current city legislation, it has raised questions about whether the law goes far enough to protect residents in older high-rise buildings. New York City passed a law in 1999 mandating the installation of sprinkler systems in high-rise buildings. However, this law applied only to new constructions, exempting buildings such as Trump Tower, which was built in 1983, from having to comply. Developers, including Donald Trump, were vocal in their opposition of the 1999 legislation. Critics of the law argued that it would impose a significant financial burden on developers, with estimates suggesting that it would add around 4 per square foot to the cost of an apartment. As reported by the New York Post in 1999, Trump personally reached out to council members to lobby against the legislation. His opposition, along with others, influenced the final version of the law and ultimately allowed older buildings to be \\"grandfathered\\" in, according to the Washington Post. Despite his vociferous resistance to the original legislation, Trump took a proactive approach in ensuring the safety of the residents in his developments. At the time, Trump made the decision to invest an extra 3 million in adding sprinklers to Trump World Tower, which was under construction. While this move was not legally required, Trump stated to the New York Times that \\"people feel safer with sprinklers,\\" but pointed out that \\"the problem with the bill is that it doesn't address the buildings that need sprinklers the most.\\" Trump went on to argue that if one examines fire-related deaths in New York, almost all of them occur in one- or two-family houses. Although his statement highlights the necessity of addressing fire safety concerns in family homes, the recent Trump Tower fire has brought focus back on the specific issues related to high-rise buildings. The fire on Saturday tragically claimed the life of 67-year-old Todd Brassner, an eccentric art collector who lived alone in the Trump Tower apartment. A friend of Brassner's shared with the New York Times that he had been trying to sell the apartment since the 2016 election, but that potential buyers were discouraged by the association with Trump. The cause of the devastating fire has not yet been determined. This tragic incident at Trump Tower serves as a reminder that although the 1999 legislation requiring sprinkler systems in the city's high-rise buildings was a step in the right direction, it may not have gone far enough in addressing fire safety concerns in older structures. As investigations into the cause of the fire continue, it is crucial for lawmakers, developers, and residents to reflect on the current state of fire safety measures in high-rise buildings and to consider whether additional legislative actions should be taken. If the death toll from fires in both high-rise and single-family homes is to decrease, a comprehensive and nuanced approach to fire safety regulations must be adopted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.

Passage:A very large snowbelt in the United States exists on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, near the cities of Houghton, Marquette, and Munising. These areas average of snow each season. For comparison, on the western shore, Duluth, Minnesota receives per season. Lake Superior and Lake Huron rarely freeze because of their size and depth; hence, lake-effect snow can fall continually in the Upper Peninsula and Canadian snowbelts during the winter months. Main areas of the Upper Peninsula snow belt include the Keweenaw Peninsula and Baraga, Marquette and Alger counties, where Lake Superior contributes to lake-effect snow, making them a prominent part of the Midwestern snow belt. Records of of snow or more have been set in many communities in this area. The Keweenaw Peninsula averages more snowfall than almost anywhere in the United States—more than anywhere east of the Mississippi River and the most of all non-mountainous regions of the continental United States. Because of the howling storms across Lake Superior, which cause dramatic amounts of precipitation, it has been said that the lake-effect snow makes the Keweenaw Peninsula the snowiest place east of the Rockies. Only one official weather station exists in this region. Located in Hancock, Michigan, this station averages well over per year. Farther north in the peninsula, lake-effect snow can occur with any wind direction. The road commission in Keweenaw County, Michigan collects unofficial data in a community called Delaware, and it strictly follows the guidelines set forth by the National Weather Service.

Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union.  - Diplomatic immunity is a form of legal immunity that ensures diplomats are given safe passage and are considered not susceptible to lawsuit or prosecution under the host country's laws, although they can still be expelled. Modern diplomatic immunity was codified as international law in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) which has been ratified by all but a handful of nations, though the concept and custom of such immunity have a much longer history dating back thousands of years. Many principles of diplomatic immunity are now considered to be customary law. Diplomatic immunity as an institution developed to allow for the maintenance of government relations, including during periods of difficulties and armed conflict. When receiving diplomats, who formally represent the sovereign, the receiving head of state grants certain privileges and immunities to ensure they may effectively carry out their duties, on the understanding that these are provided on a reciprocal basis.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.  - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.  - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada.  - Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province.  - An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration). Since \\"the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law\\", the term \\"official language\\" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government.  - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - La Sarre is a town in northwestern Quebec, Canada, and is the most populous town and seat of the Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality. It is located at the intersection of Routes 111 and 393, on the La Sarre River, a tributary of Lake Abitibi.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest.   - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city.

The region is divided into five regional county municipalities (\\"French\\": municipalité régionale de comté, or MRC) and 79 municipalities. Its economy continues to be dominated by resource extraction industries. These include logging, mining all along the rich geologic Cadillac Fault between Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda, as well as agriculture.  - Villa rustica (countryside villa) was the term used by the ancient Romans to denote a villa set in the open countryside, often as the hub of a large agricultural estate (\\"latifundium\\"). The adjective \\"rusticum\\" was used to distinguish it from an urban or resort villa. The \\"villa rustica\\" would thus serve both as a residence of the landowner and his family (and retainers) and also as a farm management centre. It would often comprise separate buildings to accommodate farm labourers and sheds and barns for animals and crops. In modern British archaeology, a \\"villa rustica\\" is commonly (and misleadingly) referred to simply as a \\"Roman villa\\".  - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian  (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.  - The Canada 2011 Census is a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population on May 10, 2011. Statistics Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, conducts a nationwide census every five years. In 2011, it consisted of a mandatory short form census questionnaire and an inaugural National Household Survey (NHS), a voluntary survey which replaced the mandatory long form census questionnaire; this substitution was the focus of much controversy. Completion of the (short form) census is mandatory for all Canadians, and those who do not complete it may face penalties ranging from fines to jail time.  - Statistics Canada, which was formed in 1971, is the Government of Canada government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. Its headquarters is in Ottawa.  - Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region.  - Ville is the modern French word of Latin origin now meaning \\"city\\" or \\"town\\", but the first meaning in the Middle Ages was \\"farm\\" (from Gallo-Romance < Latin \\"villa rustica\\") and then \\"village\\". The derivative suffix \\"-ville\\" is commonly used in English in names of cities, towns and villages.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits.

Math problem: Solve -17*o + 1071 = 26*o - 36*o + 336 for o. What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -17*o + 1071 = 26*o - 36*o + 336 for o, I will proceed step-by-step: Step 1: Simplify each side of the equation. On the left side, the equation is already simplified, so we can keep it as is: -17*o + 1071. On the right side, we combine the terms with o: 26*o - 36*o is -10*o. So, the simplified right side is -10*o + 336. The simplified equation looks like this: -17*o + 1071 = -10*o + 336 Step 2: Isolate the variable o. To do this, I will first move the -10*o term from the right side to the left side of the equation by adding 10*o to both sides: -17*o + 10*o + 1071 = 336 This simplifies to: -7*o + 1071 = 336 Next, we need to isolate the o term by moving the constant term (1071) from the left side to the right side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 1071 from both sides: -7*o = 336 - 1071 This simplifies to: -7*o = -735 Step 3: Solve for o. To find the value of o, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -7: o = -735 / -7 This simplifies to: o = 105 So, the solution to the equation -17*o + 1071 = 26*o - 36*o + 336 is o = 105."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Argento, who was dating Anthony Bourdain at the time of his death, appeared in two episodes of the show, which took place in Rome and Southern Italy, and she directed another episode in Hong Kong.      Argento and Bourdain first met on Parts Unknown while filming the Rome episode in Season 8.      In the \\"Hong Kong\\" episode in Season 11, which Argento directed, Bourdain gave a nod to their romance.      \\"To fall in love with Asia is one thing. To fall in love in Asia is another.

A fourth episode that took place in Buenos Aires was also removed, but for unspecified reasons. Bourdain and Asia reportedly met while filming the Rome episode, which aired in 2016.      As we've reported ... Asia was accused of sexually assaulting a then 17-year-old Bennett, and reportedly paid him a settlement of 380k. She denied ever having sex with him, but photos and texts obtained by TMZ appear to prove otherwise.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is chalcopyrite?\\" is in \\"Copper is synthesized in massive stars and is present in the Earth's crust at a concentration of about 50 parts per million (ppm), where it occurs as native copper or in minerals such as the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and chalcocite, the copper carbonates azurite and malachite, and the copper(I) oxide mineral cuprite. The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US. Native copper is a polycrystal, with the largest described single crystal measuring 4.4×3.2×3.2 cm.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Chalcopyrite is a copper iron sulfide mineral with a chemical composition of CuFeS2. It is an essential ore for copper extraction due to its abundance in the Earth's crust and its contribution to the global copper supply. Chalcopyrite is typically found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, particularly in hydrothermal veins and contact metamorphic zones. Chalcopyrite is a brassy-yellow mineral with a metallic luster, often displaying iridescent tarnish. As a result, it can easily be mistaken for gold or pyrite (commonly known as fool's gold). However, chalcopyrite is softer and more brittle than gold and has a lower specific gravity, which helps in distinguishing between the two. In addition to copper, chalcopyrite may also contain trace amounts of gold, silver, and other valuable elements. During the extraction process, these trace elements can be recovered as valuable byproducts. The extraction of copper from chalcopyrite typically involves a series of chemical, physical, and electrochemical processes, including roasting, smelting, and refining. Chalcopyrite, along with other copper-bearing minerals such as chalcocite, azurite, malachite, and cuprite, contribute to the Earth's copper reserves. As stated, copper is present in the Earth's crust at a concentration of about 50 parts per million (ppm) and is vital for a wide range of applications, such as electronics, plumbing, construction, and even coins. The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US. In summary, chalcopyrite is a copper iron sulfide mineral and an essential ore for copper extraction. It is abundant in the Earth's crust and has significant importance in the global copper supply. Its striking appearance, coupled with its economic significance, makes chalcopyrite a fascinating and essential mineral for our modern world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Did Alan Moore first publish comic strips in 2000 AD or Warrior? Passage 1:Saint Mari, also known as Mares and originally named Palut, is a saint of the Church of the East. He was converted by Thaddeus of Edessa (a.k.a. Addai) and is said to have had Mar Aggai as his spiritual director. He is believed to have done missionary work around Nineveh, Nisibis, and along the Euphrates, and is said to have been one of the great apostles to Syria and Persia. He was buried in Dair-Kuni. His feast day is 5 August in the Christian calendar. He and Thaddeus are credited with the Liturgy of Addai and Mari. Despite the fact that there is little, if any, concrete information on Mari, he is still venerated as a saint by the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. He is distinct from St Mari of the seventy disciples with whom the Apocryphal Acts of Mar Mari are connected.  Passage 2:White sharks also attack dolphins and porpoises from above, behind or below to avoid being detected by their echolocation. Targeted species include dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops ssp.), Humpback dolphins (Sousa ssp.), harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli). Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour. White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989, a juvenile male pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark. In addition, white sharks attack and prey upon beaked whales. Cases where an adult Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), with a mean mass of around , and a juvenile Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), an individual estimated at , were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed. When hunting sea turtles, they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper, immobilizing the turtle. The heaviest species of bony fish, the oceanic sunfish (Mola mola), has been found in great white shark stomachs.  Passage 3:Moore started writing for British underground and alternative fanzines in the late 1970s before achieving success publishing comic strips in such magazines as 2000 AD and Warrior. He was subsequently picked up by the American DC Comics, and as \\"the first comics writer living in Britain to do prominent work in America\\", he worked on major characters such as Batman () and Superman (), substantially developed the character Swamp Thing, and penned original titles such as Watchmen. During that decade, Moore helped to bring about greater social respectability for comics in the United States and United Kingdom. He prefers the term \\"comic\\" to \\"graphic novel\\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s he left the comic industry mainstream and went independent for a while, working on experimental work such as the epic From Hell and the prose novel Voice of the Fire. He subsequently returned to the mainstream later in the 1990s, working for Image Comics, before developing America's Best Comics, an imprint through which he published works such as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the occult-based Promethea. In 2016, he published Jerusalem: a 1266-page experimental novel set in his hometown of Northampton, UK.","output":"3"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation.

What is the answer to this question? who wrote the book it takes a village?","output":"The book \\"It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us\\" was written by Hillary Rodham Clinton. Published in 1996, the book focuses on the influential role various individuals and institutions have on a child's upbringing and development. As the First Lady of the United States at the time of publication, Hillary Clinton expressed her vision and ideas related to child welfare, emphasizing a collective responsibility that relies on partnerships between families, teachers, volunteers, and government policymakers. \\"It Takes a Village\\" earned critical acclaim and controversy, as it raised discussions about the role of the government in children's lives and the importance of social policies aimed at improving their well-being. The book's title has since become an emblematic phrase representing the belief that a collective, community-based approach is necessary to effectively raise and nurture the children who will shape the future. In the book, Clinton shares anecdotes and personal experiences from her own life, as well as her work as an advocate for children in Arkansas and as the First Lady. She also delves into topics such as early childhood education, healthcare, crime prevention, and the role of businesses in fostering a healthy community for children. The central thesis of the book essentially lies in the belief that every person and institution has a part to play in the nurturing and development of children.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Kittens should not leave their mother before 8 weeks of age. Indeed there is some debate about when is the right time, with some people arguing that 12 weeks is the correct age to go to a new home. However, at 12 weeks of age a kitten's ability to accept new experiences is slowing up, which means it can be harder for it to fit into a new home. Most kittens brought up from birth in loving homes and with plenty of food and love, are confident enough to leave their mothers after 8 weeks. This is a good compromise to allow the kitten to be socialized in their new home at the right age. You need to kitten proof your home before the little one arrives. Put away all hazards that the kitten could get into. This includes cleaning supplies, medicines, and small items that you treasure and don't want broken. You should also keep cords, such as computer cords or cords on blinds, out of reach of the kitten.  You may want to consider certain areas off limits to the kitten. If that is the case, you need to figure out a way to block off the areas so the kitten can't get in. Get rid of plants that are poisonous to cats. There are a wide variety of common house plants that can severely injure, or kill, a cat if it eats them. Research your plants to see if they cause a threat to your new family member. You will need to buy a variety of items in order to meet the needs of your new family member. These items include (but are not limited to):  A litter box: A kitten's little legs require a low-sided tray so it can hop in without problems. You can always change to a deep-sided litter box once the kitten is older. Cat litter: Avoid clumping cat litter since kittens like to explore with their mouths and if it swallows clumping cat litter it can form a blockage in its gut. Food and water bowls: Ceramic or stainless steel are best, as these wash well and the surface doesn't scratch and harbour bacteria like plastic bowls do. Kitten food: Start by feeding the same food the kitten was weaned onto. Ask whoever has been taking care of the cat for the brand of food and how much they have been giving it. Hiding places: The kitten will be anxious at first, so provide plenty of hiding places, such as cardboard boxes, where it can feel safe as it gathers its courage. Blankets or a soft bed: Soft bedding to snuggle into is important for the kitten. Try to bring the blanket or soft bed when you pick up the kitten, so that you can get some familiar smells on it from its mother and original home. Comb or brush:  Groom your kitten from an early age so it doesn't mind being combed as an adult. This is especially important for long-haired cats. This should contain its food, water, bedding, hiding places, and litter tray. Leave the kitten in peace to explore for a little while and find that the room is safe.  Spend some time with the kitten in its room and sit on the floor. Let it come to you to explore. Speak gently and quietly, and if she rubs against you gently stroke her back. As the kitten gets to know where to find food, water, and its tray, and over the coming days as it becomes bolder, you can start leaving the room door open so it can slip out to explore.","output":"This article emphasizes waiting until kittens are at least 8 weeks old before separating them from their mother and provides tips for kitten-proofing homes, buying necessary supplies, and helping them adjust to their new environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A Nobel Prize is considered by most people one of the highest international honours  a person can receive. As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement. In 1972, for example, no Nobel Peace Prize was given. Question: When was Alfred Nobel born? Options: A: In 1938. B: In 1833. C: In 1896.

Fictional characters play a crucial role in captivating readers and immersing them in the world of literature, cinema, and other forms of creative media. When a character is skilfully portrayed, it can leave a lasting impression on the audience, making them reflect on their own life experiences and behaviour. This can even lead to dedicated fans who invest their time and energy into exploring the depth of these characters and their significance within the story. One of the key factors that helps in creating such strong connections to fictional characters is the level of detail and complexity in their descriptions. A well-developed character has distinctive traits, emotions, desires, and morals, which are often portrayed through thoughtful actions, dialogue, and background stories. This makes these characters easily relatable, intriguing, and memorable, generating a genuine interest in understanding their motivations and worldviews. Through a deep and intricate exploration of a character's psyche and motivations, the author has the opportunity to instil a sense of depth and realism that leaves the audience wanting more. When a character's actions and decisions are driven by a set of consistent values and motivations, it translates to authentic and human emotions, thereby evoking powerful responses from the readers. Many popular and thought-provoking stories have fascinated their audience by focusing on complex and multi-dimensional characters. Some examples of these captivating characters include: 1. Sherlock Holmes – When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created the character of Sherlock Holmes, he gave birth to a genius detective with exceptional observational and deductive reasoning skills. Holmes' eccentricities, intriguing personality, and exquisite methods of solving mysteries have been a subject of keen analysis and admiration for generations of readers. 2. Hamlet – William Shakespeare's Hamlet raises deep questions about human nature, morality, and the meaning of life through the tormented character of Hamlet, whose contemplations on revenge, death, and uncertainty have been interpreted in various ways by scholars and theatre enthusiasts worldwide. 3. Severus Snape – J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series introduced us to Snape, a character whose true motives and loyalties remained hidden until the final book. Snape's complicated past and role in the series evoked strong emotions from the fandom, turning him into one of the most debated characters in modern literature. The in-depth exploration of these characters' actions and motivations, combined with their relatable nature, led to a lasting following and devotion among the audience. Analyzing fictional characters can serve as a form of escapism, self-discovery, and curiosity, enriching and expanding our understanding of human emotions and experiences. This connection and fascination with characters in literature and media further highlight the importance and impact of skilled character development in captivating and engaging audiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, they ended up lost in the park.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Guitar Hero Encore : Rocks the 80s ( titled Guitar Hero : Rocks the 80s in Europe ) is a music rhythm game and the third installment in the popular Guitar Hero series . It was released in July 2007 in North America and Europe , and in August 2007 in Australia . Players use a guitar - shaped controller ( purchased separately ) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player . Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series , rather than a full sequel . No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game . As implied by the game 's title , the game features a 1980s theme , consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters , fashions , and artwork that reflect the time period . The game was not as well - received as the prior two Guitar Hero games , due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack . Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band . The next major installment of the series , Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , was developed by Activision 's Neversoft division .  - A game controller is a device used with games or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. A controller is usually connected to a game console or computer by means of a wire or cord, although, since the mid-2000s, wireless controllers have become widespread. Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games, are also game controllers.  - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.   - Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.

Recently, inactivation of STAT3 has been demonstrated as a therapeutic candidate for autoimmune arthritis.

We hypothesized that PTEN regulated by p53 might reduce CIA severity and inflammatory response via inhibiting STAT3 activation. Our results revealed that PTEN could ameliorate experimental autoimmune arthritis by reducing STAT3 activity and Th17 differentiation. Systemic infusion of PTEN overexpression downregulated CIA severity. In addition, PTEN overexpression decreased the activation of T cells and modulated reciprocal differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells. We observed that PTEN expression downregulated by p53 deficiency induced the activation of STAT3. Loss of p53 exacerbated autoimmune arthritis and dysregulated the population of Th17 and Treg. These data suggest that induction of STAT3-modulatory activity of PTEN may be a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis therapy.

Does the sentence \\"Bryzoa may be the most basal phylum (the one that first became distinctive) within the Lophotrochozoa, and the relationships between the other members are not yet known.\\" answer the question \\"What is the other superphylum besides protostomes?\\" Possible answers: (I) yes (II) no","output":"(II) No, the sentence \\"Bryzoa may be the most basal phylum (the one that first became distinctive) within the Lophotrochozoa, and the relationships between the other members are not yet known.\\" does not directly answer the question \\"What is the other superphylum besides protostomes?\\". To answer that question, we first need to understand the context of the two primary superphyla within the animal kingdom - protostomes and deuterostomes. In the animal kingdom, there are two main groups of animals distinguished by their early embryonic development: protostomes and deuterostomes. Protostomes and deuterostomes are termed as superphyla because they encompass several phyla within each group, based on key developmental and morphological features. Protostomes are a diverse group of animals that undergo a specific pattern of embryonic development called protostomy (meaning \\"mouth first\\"). These animals are characterized by a spiral cleavage pattern during embryonic development, and the blastopore, or the first opening formed during embryogenesis, develops into the mouth. Protostomes are further divided into two major groups: Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. Lophotrochozoa include phyla like mollusks, annelids, and bryozoans, while Ecdysozoa include arthropods and nematodes. The sentence provided in the question discusses the uncertainty in the relationships between the phyla within Lophotrochozoa, specifically mentioning Bryzoa as potentially the most basal phylum. Deuterostomes are the other superphylum, distinguished by a different pattern of embryonic development called deuterostomy (meaning \\"mouth second\\"). Deuterostomes display radial cleavage patterns and the blastopore develops into the animal's anus, with the mouth forming later. Key phyla within the deuterostome superphylum include chordates (e.g., vertebrates like humans), echinoderms (e.g., starfish), and hemichordates (e.g., acorn worms). In conclusion, the sentence provided in the question does not answer the inquiry about the other superphylum besides protostomes, which is deuterostomes. Instead, it primarily discusses intra-group relationships within a subgroup of the protostome superphylum, Lophotrochozoa."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: In 2000, Apple released the Power Mac G4 Cube, their first desktop since the discontinued Power Macintosh G3, to slot between the iMac G3 and the Power Mac G4. Even with its innovative design, it was initially priced US200 higher than the comparably-equipped and more-expandable base Power Mac G4, while also not including a monitor, making it too expensive and resulting in slow sales. Apple sold just 29,000 Cubes in Q4 of 2000 which was one third of expectations, compared to 308,000 Macs during that same quarter, and Cube sales dropped to 12,000 units in Q1 of 2001. A price drop and hardware upgrades could not offset the earlier perception of the Cube's reduced value compared to the iMac and Power Mac G4 lineup, and it was discontinued in July 2001.

And the answer is?","output":"The patron saint for soldiers is Saint Martin of Tours, who is also known as Saint Martin the Merciful and the Apostle of Gaul. Born in 316 or 336 AD in Pannonia, which is modern-day Hungary, Martin was the son of a high-ranking officer in the Roman army, and he was to follow in his father's footsteps by joining the military. At the age of 15, Martin was conscripted into the Roman army and was stationed in Gaul, which is now modern-day France. His life took a remarkable turn when young Martin encountered a shivering beggar at the city gates of Amiens in France during a particularly harsh winter. Despite the freezing cold, Martin decided to cut his own military cloak in half and shared it with the beggar. That night, he dreamt of Jesus Christ wearing the half of the cloak he had given to the beggar. In the dream, Jesus told the angels that Martin, who was not yet even baptized, had clothed him. The dream had a profound impact on Martin, and he was baptized soon after. He remained in the military but requested to be released, claiming that he could not serve both God and the Roman Emperor. Upon being discharged, Martin embarked upon a spiritual journey, learning from and eventually succeeding Saint Hilary of Poitiers, the bishop who had baptized him. In 371 AD, Martin was elected as the third bishop of Tours, a position he held until his death in 397 AD. Although he desired a more secluded monastic life, as bishop, he travelled extensively to spread the Christian faith, fought against paganism, and sought social justice for the poor. His compassionate nature and dedication to the service of God eventually led to him being venerated as the patron saint of beggars, wool weavers, the poor, and of course, soldiers. Saint Martin of Tours is celebrated on November 11th, known as \\"Martinmas,\\" which is a notable day in the Christian calendar that also traditionally marks the beginning of winter. Over time, Saint Martin's protection and guidance became especially significant for those who serve in the armed forces, as they often encounter situations of danger and conflict that can challenge their faith, just as Martin did during his time both in the military and afterward as a spiritual leader."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

This crime thriller is notable for featuring the last on-screen performance of James Gandolfini before his death and another strong performance from actor Tom Hardy. Adapted from the short story titled \\"Animal Rescue\\" by Dennis Lehane, the same author who wrote \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" and \\"Mystic River,\\" \\"The Drop\\" was directed by Michaël R. Roskam and is a prime example of the author's gritty and immersive storytelling style used in his other works. \\"The Drop\\" takes place in Brooklyn, New York, and revolves around a simple yet kind-hearted bartender named Bob Saginowski (played by Tom Hardy). He works in a local bar that serves as a \\"drop bar\\" for funneling the dirty money gathered by mobsters. The bar is owned by Bob's cousin, Marv (James Gandolfini), a former criminal who has lost his influence and position in the underworld due to his inability to adapt to the new rules of the game. Marv is resentful not only towards the new mobsters but also himself for failing to stand up against them. The movie delves into themes of criminal underworlds, family loyalty, and sacrifice. Throughout the film, Bob navigates the moral dilemmas of his position, balancing his allegiance to Marv and his own values of doing what's right. The narrative also explores the complexity of Bob's relationship with a woman named Nadia (Noomi Rapace), who he meets after finding an abused and abandoned puppy in her garbage can. Gandolfini delivers a powerful performance as the bitter and resentful Marv, capturing the complexities of a character who realizes he has lost the power he once had.

Upon witnessing the near-disastrous event, the building's inhabitants and on-site personnel couldn't help but feel a swell of gratitude for the engineers who had so skillfully averted a catastrophe. They mused about the countless hours spent meticulously studying design specifications, running simulations, and fine-tuning the intricate web of synthetic fibers that comprised the nearly invisible, yet crucial, safety net. Even though the situation had been brought under control, the necessity of addressing the issue of the compromised floor could not be ignored. But now, instead of panicking, everyone involved approached the problem with renewed confidence, knowing that the engineers' expertise and attention to detail would help to quickly resolve the situation. A team of specialists was immediately dispatched to the site, conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the structural problem and formulating a plan of action for repairs and possible improvements to further guarantee the facility's integrity. The findings of their research not only highlighted the importance of diligent monitoring of infrastructure for early signs of wear, but also emphasized the crucial role that cutting-edge technology played in architecting — and safeguarding — these modern marvels of construction. The engineers' achievements were recognized beyond the confines of the building, as word spread about their ingenious solution to a potentially fatal problem.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 9*r - 13*r = 16 for the variable r, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the r terms Both terms on the left side of the equation contain the variable r. Therefore, we can combine these two terms. To do so, we subtract 13*r from 9*r. 9*r - 13*r = -4*r Now, the equation becomes: -4*r = 16 Step 2: Isolate the variable r To isolate r, we will need to divide both sides of the equation by -4. This will allow us to cancel out the -4 on the left side, leaving us with just the variable r. (-4*r) / (-4) = 16 / (-4) On the left side, -4 cancels out: r = -4 Step 3: Check the solution (optional) To ensure that our solution is correct, we can plug the value of r back into the original equation and check if both sides of the equation are equal. 9*(-4) - 13*(-4) = 16 -36 + 52 = 16 16 = 16 Both sides of the equation are equal, so r = -4 is the correct solution.

Article: Time spent in a bookshop can be most enjoyable, whether you are book-lover or only there to buy a book as a present. You may even have entered the shop just to find a shelter from a sudden shower. Whatever the reason is, you can soon be totally unaware of your surroundings. You soon become attracted in some books or others, and usually it is only much later that you realize you have spent too much time there and must dash off to keep some forgotten appointments. This opportunity to escape the realities of everyday life is the main attraction of a bookshop. A music shop is very much like a bookshop. You can wander round such a place to your heart's content. If it is a good shop, no assistant will approach you with the greeting \\"Can I help you?\\" You needn't buy anything you don't want. In a bookshop an assistant should remain in the back ground until you have finished reading. Then, and only then, are his services necessary. Once a medical student had to read a text book which was far too expensive for him to buy. He couldn't obtain it from the library and the only copy he could find was in a certain bookshop. Every afternoon, therefore, he would go along to the shop and read a little of the book at a time. One day, however, he was disappointed to find the book missing from its usual place. He was about to leave, when he noticed the owner of the shop beckoning to him. Expecting to be told off, he went towards him. To his surprise, the owner pointed to the book which was tucked away in a corner. \\"I put it there in case anyone was tempted to buy it!\\" he said, and left the delighted student to continue his reading. Question: According to the passage, the main attraction of a bookshop is   _   . Answer: Select from: A). the chance to get free from the reality. B). learning something from the books. C). a shelter from a sudden shower. D). the surrounding of books. Answer:","output":"A). the chance to get free from the reality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Kids Who Lose A Parent More Likely to Commit Suicide In what would definitely win the prize for Saddest Health Discovery of the Week, a new study has found that kids whose parents die while they are young are more likely to commit suicide later in life than kids whose parents survive until they are adults. Researchers in Denmark had previously established that kids who lost a parent were more likely to die in the next 40 years than people whose parents survived until the kids were at least 18 years old, but after they dug deeper into the data they found that part of the reason for that was that they were more likely to commit suicide. Only about 4% of kids lose their parents while they’re young, at least in western countries with modern healthcare, and the vast majority of them manage to adapt. But others develop what the researchers call “preventable social and psychological problems.” The numbers of those taking their own life in the ensuing years are small but significant. The study, which was done by researchers at Aarhus University, looked at government data on 7.3 million kids from Denmark, Sweden and Finland. They found 189,094 who had a lost a parent before they turned 18. They compared that with data on 1.8 million kids who went through childhood with their parents intact. They followed the outcomes for both groups for 40 years. Kids who lost a parent were twice as likely to commit suicide as the control group, especially if they were boys. The risk was equally high no matter the cause of death, whether the parent committed suicide or not. While the study just looked at data and could not control for such risk factors as genetics, social networks and family lifestyle, its results are borne out by an earlier study from the University of Pittsburgh, which found that kids whose parents died suddenly were at higher risk for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. While parents hardly need to be warned to take whatever steps they deem necessary to live for a good long time, there are other less obvious implications from the study. The Danish authors conclude that even if the kids look like they’re doing fine, therapy may well be warranted: “Our study points to the early mitigation of distress to reduce the risk of suicidal behavior among children who had a parent who died during childhood,” they write. While the study limited its scope to families in Scandinavia, where access to health care and social services is plentiful, the situation for the many millions of kids who live in countries without such supports, or where the death of a parent is much more likely, would seem to be even more dire. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses a study that found children who lose a parent while they are young are more likely to commit suicide later in life compared to those whose parents survive until they are adults. The study was conducted by researchers at Aarhus University and analyzed data from 7.3 million kids in Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. Children who lost a parent before turning 18 had twice the risk of committing suicide compared to those with both parents intact, especially if they were boys. The risk was the same regardless of the cause of the parent's death. This study supports the findings of an earlier study from the University of Pittsburgh that showed children whose parents died suddenly had a higher risk for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The Danish researchers concluded that even if children appear to be coping well after the loss of a parent, therapy might be beneficial to mitigate distress and reduce the risk of suicidal behavior.

Article: Millions of stars are travelling about in space. A few form groups which travel together, but most of them travel alone. And they travel through a universe which is so large that one star seldom comes near to another. For the most important part each star makes its journey in complete loneliness, like a ship on an empty ocean. The ship will be well over a million miles from its nearest neighbour. From this it is easy to understand why a star seldom finds another anywhere near it. We believe, however, that some two thousand million years ago, another star wandering  through space, happened to come near our sun just as the sun and the moon raised its tides  on the earth, so this star must have raised tides on the surface of the sun. But they were very different from the small tides that are raised in our oceans; A large tidal  wave must have travelled over the surface of the sun, at last forming a mountain so high that we cannot imagine it. As the cause of the disturbance came nearer, so the mountain rose higher and higher. And before the star began to move away again, its tidal pull had become so powerful that this mountain was torn to pieces and thrown off small parts of itself into space. These small pieces have been going round the sun ever since. They are the planets. Question: Some two thousand years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because   _  . - the star moved away from the sun - another star happened to come near the sun - the sun and the moon raised the tides on the earth - a large tidal of wave travelled over the surface of the sun Answer:","output":"Some two thousand years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because another star happened to come near the sun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

Article: A meteorite   flew fast across the sky and exploded over central Russia on Friday, raining fireballs over a vast area and causing a shock wave that smashed windows, damaged buildings and injured l,200 people. People heading to work in Chelyabinsk heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt the shock wave. According to Russian space agency Roscosmos, the fireball, travelling at a speed of 30km per second, had burnt very brightly across the horizon, leaving a long white trail that could be seen as far as 200km away. Car alarms went off, thousands of windows shattered and mobile phone networks were disrupted. \\"I was driving to work, it was quite dark, but it suddenly became as bright as if it were day,\\" said Viktor Prokofiev, 36, a resident of Yekaterinburg in the Urals Mountains. \\"I felt like I was blinded by headlights.\\" The meteorite, which weighed about 20 tons and may have been made of iron, entered Earth's atmosphere and broke apart 30-50km above ground, according to Russia's Academy of Sciences. The energy released when it entered the Earth's atmosphere was about several thousand tons, the academy said, the power of a small atomic weapon exploding. No deaths were reported, but the Emergencies Ministry said 20,000 rescue and clean-up workers were sent to the region after President Vladimir Putin told Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov to ease the disruption and help the victims. The Interior Ministry said about l,200 people had been injured, at least 200 of them children, and most from broken pieces of glass.\\"While events this big are rare, an impact that could cause damage and death could happen every century or so.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.

PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian’s Style Secrets Revealed      “Okay, I love you, bye,” viewers heard the woman on the other end say, as Kourtney remarked in confessional that the whole thing was “shady.”      But Bruce had confided to the cameras that he was lonely after his split from Kris, and admitted he even missed her drama.      Still, there was big drama to come after Kourtney told Kim and Khloe the news.      “It’s weird Bruce hasn’t mentioned to anyone talking to one of my mom’s good friends,” Kim Kardashian told the cameras.      PHOTOS: Kanye’s 60 Most Outrageous & Unbelievable Quotes      After Kris learned from the girls what her ex-husband was doing, she sighed to the cameras, “It stings a little bit if Bruce is going to hang with my friends.”      Later in the episode, Kim, who felt bad for her mom, decided to confront Bruce.      “Do you actually think I’m dating anybody?” Bruce scoffed.      “My mom cries at night about how her friend can do this to her,” Kim told him.      PHOTOS: 20 Most Ridiculous Moments From The Kardashians’ Reality Shows      Bruce revealed in confessional it was only a friendship, and that Kris couldn’t dictate who he could see, but he decided to talk things out with the “Momager” anyway.      As Kim looked on, Kris told him, “There isn’t anybody that would think that this is okay — it’s shady, Bruce.”      Bruce insisted the lady was a friend and added, “I am not trying to hide anybody — I have not done anything.”      But Kris bashed her ex: “All you care about is brushing it under the rug and continually saying, ‘Oh, it’s okay.’ Because it’s okay with you, and your needs are being met. You don’t care about the hurt feelings you leave along the way.”      PHOTOS: Say What?! 18 Of Kris Jenner’s Most Outrageous Quotes      Bruce countered, “This is your problem, not mine.”      Raging Kris said, “You didn’t take into any consideration any of our feelings and how this would affect us. You’re kind of an a**hole. I’m sorry, that’s the way I feel.”      Bruce replied, “I’m sorry if I made you feel bad … there was nothing mean in my heart … sorry.”      Kris revealed in confessional that Bruce was her best friend for years, and she had expected a little more communication and respect, but there would be “growing pains” as they both moved on.      PHOTOS: See How Fame — And Plastic Surgery — Transformed Kris & Bruce Jenner Over 22 Years Of Marriage Before Divorce      Also on the episode, the girls threw their mom a Hawaiian-themed “Kris J needs a lei” party to counter Bruce’s sons Brandon and Brody celebrating his single life with a “Bruce on the loose” bash.      As Radar previously reported, viewers also saw Kim telling all about her sex life and attempts to get pregnant with a second child by husband Kanye West, to add to their family with daughter North.      At one point, Kim told her sisters that she was lying down because she’d just had sex with West and was hoping to conceive!      Later, there was more TMI as Kim did a nude photo shoot, and revealed to Khloe that she had forced West to visit, telling him, “I’m ovulating today!”      PHOTOS: Kim Kardashian Says Pregnancy Weight Gain Was God’s Way of Humbling Her — 13 Pics Of How Huge She Got      Kim indicated they’d had sex in the bathroom of the photo studio because, “There’s only a 20 percent chance of getting pregnant every month. I know that I’m ovulating right now so you gotta get it in where you can get it in.”      Mario, Kim’s makeup artist, revealed how West followed her into the bathroom and ten minutes later “she comes out and she had the most beautiful glow on her face, little bits of sweat dripping, and she goes, ‘I gotta lay down for ten minutes.'”      Also, Kim consulted a fertility doctor as part of her “mission to get pregnant.”      The reality queen desperately wanted daughter North to grow up with siblings as she had.      PHOTOS: Painted Prima Donnas! Breakouts, Skin Disease, Temper Tantrums & More—Kardashians’ Makeup Artists Tell All!      “Because it’s been so tough, I’m seeing fertility doctor to see exactly when I’m ovulating and increase my odds of getting pregnant naturally,” she said.      Kim asked the doctor if they were more likely to have a boy if they had sex right when she was ovulating (instead of a few days before), but he laughed that was a myth.      Later, when all the girls took Bruce to lunch, a disappointed Kim showed up and announced she’d gotten her period and wasn’t pregnant that month.      But Kim admitted in confessional that she and West needed to relax and avoid planning so much.      PHOTOS: Kardashian Family Secrets – Housekeepers Reveal All Their Hidden Dirt      Viewers also learned on the Sunday premiere that Khloe was taking a break with her rapper boyfriend French Montana, and sister Kourtney was relieved, saying, “He’s so dumb.”      Viewers also saw Bruce’s son Brody diss Kim’s hubby Kanye.      At a party for Bruce in Las Vegas, Brody talked to his brother Brandon, Kourtney, Scott Disick, and Bruce’s son Burt about not attending Kim’s wedding.      Brody said about Kim and Kanye, “I’m very happy for them, but do you think that they were really like, ‘We have to have Brody and Kaitlynn [Carter, his girlfriend] there. If they’re not there then this wedding is not going to happen.’      PHOTOS: From Biggest Diva & Set Drunk To Most Fake—’KUWTK’ Producers Tell All!      “Nobody really gave a f*ck if Kaitlynn or I went.”      When Bruce pointed out that Brody had attended the wedding of Reggie Bush, Kim’s ex, Brody said, “Of course! Why wouldn’t I? I love Reggie. Put Kanye and Reggie together in a burning building, guess who I’m saving? Reggie all the way.”      Later, Bruce’s rarely-seen oldest son, Burt, mysteriously told Kourtney to say goodbye to Rob and Khloe for him because of Kris and Bruce’s divorce.      But Kim later indicated all of the step-sons were family to her.

A: Soviet propaganda and representatives went to great lengths to minimize the importance of the fact that they had opposed and fought against the Nazis in various ways for a decade prior to signing the Pact.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: The anti-Nazi propaganda machine operated for quite some time before the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. To provide a detailed and long answer about the duration of the anti-Nazi propaganda, let's examine the timeline of events leading up to the infamous pact. The rise of the Nazis in Germany began in the early 1930s, with their political ascent and the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. The anti-Nazi propaganda machine wasn't limited to any single country and wasn't only used by the Soviets. The anti-Nazi sentiment was common in Western Europe and the United States as well. Taking a closer look at the Soviets, we can see that they first began their anti-Nazi propaganda campaign soon after the Nazis took power. This campaign picked up momentum after the Nazis declared their intention to eradicate communism and expand eastwards to build their “Greater Germany.” Therefore, the beginning of the Soviet anti-Nazi propaganda can be traced to early 1933. In the following years, the anti-Nazi propaganda efforts were particularly marked by the establishment of the Popular Front policy, which aimed to unite the Soviet Union and other European countries against the growing German threat. The Popular Front policy was implemented by the Communist International (Comintern) from 1934 to 1939. On August 23, 1939, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (also known as the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact) was signed between the German Reich and the Soviet Union. The Soviets continued their anti-Nazi propaganda efforts up until the pact was signed, despite backchannel communications between the two nations. Given that the Soviet anti-Nazi propaganda campaign started in early 1933 and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed in August 1939, the anti-Nazi propaganda machine ran for approximately six and a half years before the pact-signing. However, it is essential to note that the anti-Nazi propaganda continued in different forms and by other nations throughout World War II, especially after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, which marked the end of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Murder by Death Movie plot: A group of detectives, each accompanied by a relative or associate, is invited to \\"dinner and a murder\\" by the mysterious Lionel Twain (Truman Capote). Having lured his guests to his mansion (the address of which is shown early on as \\"22 Lola Lane\\" and spoken later as \\"Two-Two Twain\\") managed by a blind butler and a deaf-mute cook, named Yvetta (Nancy Walker), Twain announces that it is in fact he who is the greatest detective in the world. In order to prove his claim, he challenges the guests to solve a murder which will take place in the house at midnight that very night; a reward of 1 million will be presented to the winner.Before midnight, the butler is found dead, and at midnight Twain himself appears, also dead; the cook is discovered to have been an animated mannequin, now packed in a storage crate. The party spends the rest of the evening investigating, dining and bickering. They are manipulated by a mysterious behind-the-scenes force, confused by red herrings, baffled by the \\"mechanical marvel\\" that is Twain's house and ultimately find their own lives threatened.

However, each detective then claims that the butler is in fact various incarnations of Twain's associates (such as Irving Goldman or Marvin Metzger) or even his daughter. At first the butler plays the part of each of the persons with whom he's identified, but then pulls off a mask to reveal Lionel Twain himself, very much alive. Twain then disparages each of the detectives (and effectively the authors who created them) for the way in which the plots in their adventures have been handled, including:...

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

Is \\"According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Zähringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear.\\" the correct answer?","output":"No, the answer you provided does not directly answer the question about the live animals kept in the Bärengraben. However, it does provide a background on the significance of bears in Bern's history. Let me provide you with a detailed response to your question. The Bärengraben, or Bear Pit, is a bear enclosure located in the city of Bern, Switzerland. The historical Bear Pit has been a symbol of the city since its founding, and a bear has been present in Bern for centuries. It has been documented that the Bärengraben has housed live bears since the early 16th century. The significance of the bear is derived from the local legend you mentioned, which states that the founder of Bern, Berchtold V, Duke of Zähringen, named the city after the first animal he encountered on a hunt, which happened to be a bear. Originally, the Bärengraben was an actual pit, and bears were kept in confined spaces with limited facilities for their well-being. As the years passed and awareness about animal welfare grew, changes were introduced to improve the living conditions of the bears. Gradually, the Bärengraben shifted from being a pit to a more spacious enclosure, allowing the bears to move around, play, and swim. The bear enclosure was expanded in 2009 when the \\"BärenPark\\" (Bear Park), a larger and more natural habitat for the bears, was built along the River Aare. The bears that have been historically kept in the Bärengraben are European brown bears (Ursus arctos arctos). These bears are native to Europe and are the most widely distributed of all the eight species of bears. Currently, the BärenPark houses two bears named Finn and Björk, who have been living there since 2010. The bear park also witnessed the birth of a female cub named Ursina in 2019, who eventually moved to another bear park in Switzerland in 2020. In summary, the Bärengraben traditionally housed European brown bears, representing the animal from the local legend which inspired the name and symbol of the city of Bern. Over the years, the bear enclosure has shifted from a pit to a more natural, modern habitat designed to ensure the well-being of the bears."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

When Ince suddenly goes missing, it's up to an elite group of agents to uncover the truth behind his disappearance.

Step 3: Unravel the conspiracy As they delve deeper into the mystery, the team stumbles upon a sinister plot. They realize that Dr. Ince had been selling state secrets to the highest bidder, having developed a secondary missile control system that could be manipulated by foreign powers.

Answer the following question: Two earth-like planets orbited the same star.  The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II ,however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which planet caused more climate change?  Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Answer:","output":"Given the information in the paragraph and the hint provided, Earth I caused more climate change.  Step 1: Identify the sources of climate change mentioned in the text. - The text mentions that anthropogenic (human-made) releases of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, contribute to climate change and global warming. Step 2: Compare the two Earth-like planets' approaches to the environment. - Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. - Earth II was more environmentally conscious and protected its environment from anthropogenic changes. Step 3: Analyze how each planet's actions affect climate change. - Earth I directly contributed to climate change by releasing greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the atmosphere, leading to global warming. - Earth II took measures to prevent anthropogenic changes, implying that they likely released fewer greenhouse gases and had a smaller impact on climate change. Conclusion: Earth I caused more climate change due to its release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, while Earth II made efforts to protect its environment from anthropogenic changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As I strolled through the packed corridors of the mall, I couldn't help but notice the vast array of colorful shops and shoppers in a hurry. Loud advertisements bombarded me from every angle, urging me to make impulse purchases I didn't need. I longed for an oasis of calm amidst the cacophony of noise, and that's when my olfactory senses guided me to the cafe. Upon entering the cafe, I was met with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. It was an eclectic blend of modern and vintage decor, complete with mismatched furniture and a rustic wooden barista station. The large windows filled the space with abundant natural light, allowing for an open and airy feel. Green plants dotted around the interior added a touch of life and color. The cafe's patrons appeared at ease—students typing away on laptops, friends catching up over steaming mugs of coffee, and individuals enjoying a quiet moment with their favorite novel. The gentle murmur of conversations and the soft tunes of indie rock playing in the background created a serene environment, in stark contrast to the frenzied mall outside. I approached the counter, greeted by a friendly barista wearing a vibrant, patterned apron. Her genuine smile made me feel instantly at home, and she attentively took my order as she explained the day's specials. Unable to resist the allure of a caramel macchiato and almond croissant, I gratefully collected my tray and searched for a table with an inviting ambiance. As I sipped on my perfectly crafted beverage, my nerves began to settle, and my senses were engaged by the delicate textures and flavors of my chosen pastry. Each bite was divine, as the flakes of buttery dough harmonized with the sweet, nutty filling. I relished every mouthful, appreciative of the culinary artistry put into each creation. Leisurely savoring each moment in the cafe, I pulled out a book and found myself lost in its pages, comfortably seated on a plush sofa next to an old-fashioned floor lamp. Time seemed to slow, as if the cafe was a refuge from the hurried energy of the outside world. My experience at the cafe was a testament to the power of ambiance and thoughtful design. It cultivated an environment where customers could unwind, momentarily escaping the relentless pressures and distractions of the world. As I reluctantly left the sanctuary of the cafe and braced myself to face the mall again, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to recharge and indulge in the comfort of its warm embrace. I look forward to the next time I find myself seeking solace, knowing the cafe awaits with open arms and a promise of serenity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This statement can be analyzed and understood from multiple perspectives such as emotional, environmental, aesthetic, and practical. 1. Emotional perspective: The use of the word \\"hate\\" indicates a strong negative emotion in which the person making the statement may be experiencing a heightened sense of agitation or frustration. This emotive language is an indication that the individual has a particularly strong level of dislike for dry grass, perhaps beyond what might be expected in a casual conversation. 2. Environmental perspective: From an environmental viewpoint, dry grass may signify a lack of water or poor environmental conditions that lead to grass becoming parched and brittle. Consequently, the sentiment in the tweet may reflect concerns about climate change, water scarcity, or any deterioration of natural habitats. Indirectly, the statement could be a call for more sustainable practices to preserve the environment and maintain the health of the grass and the ecosystem it supports. 3. Aesthetic perspective: From an aesthetic perspective, the sentiment expressed in the tweet could indicate a preference for more vibrant, lush, and green landscapes. In this context, dry grass is in opposition to what the person finds visually appealing, as it is often characterized by a pale, yellowish hue and a coarse, straw-like texture. In this respect, the tweet may be seen as an expression of a personal aesthetic judgment or a broader commentary on the beauty of well-maintained landscapes. 4. Practical perspective: The mention of dry grass may also be interpreted as a pragmatic concern. When grass becomes dry, it is often sharp, crunchy, and generally uncomfortable to engage with physically – whether by walking barefoot, sitting, or engaging in recreational activities. Aversion to dry grass may reflect the individual's preference for comfort, or a desire to avoid potential hazards like grass fires, which are more likely to occur in dry conditions. 5. Personal experiences: The sentiment expressed in this tweet could be based on the person's prior experiences with dry grass. Negative experiences like allergies or inhaling the dust or pollen from dry grass, as well as insect infestations, could have shaped this person's aversion to the unpleasantness of dry grass. In summary, the sentiment embodied by this tweet is a strong aversion to dry grass that can be understood through various perspectives, including emotional, environmental, aesthetic, practical, and personal experiences. This statement may reveal the individual's deep dislike for dry grass and an underlying concern for a variety of interconnected issues, such as environmental conservation and personal well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It can be an effective way to address various issues, such as financial affairs, property division, and child custody. To initiate a legal separation, several forms must be completed, filed with the court, and served to the other party. This article will provide a step-by-step guide to filling out necessary forms and the process to follow for a smooth legal separation. Step 1: Fill out a Petition for Legal Separation The first step in the legal separation process is filling out a Petition for Legal Separation. This document officially requests the court to grant a legal separation and states the reasons for the request. Both spouses must provide personal information, such as names, addresses, and marriage details. They must also include details related to their children (if any), property, and financial circumstances. It is essential to be honest and thorough when completing this form, as it sets the tone for the entire legal separation process. Step 2: Fill out a Summons A Summons is a legal document used to notify the other spouse (the respondent) that a legal separation has been initiated. This form contains information about the court where the case will be heard and deadlines to respond to the Petition for Legal Separation. The respondent must be served with this document to be legally informed of the process and provide them the opportunity to respond accordingly. Step 3: Complete a Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) (if applicable) If the separating couple has minor children, a Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) form must be completed. This form helps the court determine the appropriate jurisdiction to handle custody and visitation issues. The form asks for information about the children, their residences, and any other custody cases or proceedings involving the children. Step 4: Fill out a Fee Waiver (if applicable) If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee for a legal separation, you can apply for a Fee Waiver. This form requests the court to waive the filing fees due to financial hardship. To qualify for a fee waiver, you must provide proof of your financial situation, such as income, expenses, and any public assistance you receive. Step 5: Complete any required local forms Local court jurisdictions may have additional forms required for the legal separation process. Check with your local court to determine if any other documents need to be completed. Step 6: File your forms with the court Once all necessary forms are filled out, file them with the court in the county where you or your spouse reside. Pay the filing fee (unless a fee waiver is granted) and obtain a stamped copy of the filed documents for your records. Step 7: Serve the filed forms on the other party After filing your forms with the court, the other spouse must be officially served with copies of the filed documents. You cannot serve the papers yourself; instead, they must be delivered by someone who is not involved in the case, such as a sheriff, private process server, or another eligible adult. Proof of service, typically in the form of a completed and signed Affidavit or Proof of Service form, must be filed with the court. Conclusion Initiating a legal separation can be a complex process, but by carefully following each step outlined above and diligently completing the required forms, you can ensure a smoother legal journey.

What was the exact London address of Sherlock Holmes?","output":"Sherlock Holmes' exact London address, as originally depicted in the stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is 221B Baker Street, London, England. This famous location served as the residence and primary investigatory base for both Holmes and his loyal friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson. 221B Baker Street is located in the affluent and bustling Marylebone area of London, towards the northern end of Baker Street. The address was chosen by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to reflect the importance and prestige of the fictional detective and his profession. However, it is important to note that when the stories were written in the late 19th and early 20th century, the higher-numbered addresses did not exist on Baker Street, making the location purely fictional. Today, the location is a site of enormous cultural significance, drawing tourists and fans of the famed detective from all around the world. In 1990, the Sherlock Holmes Museum was established at 221B Baker Street (although the actual building's address is 239 Baker Street) to pay tribute to the great detective and his creator. The museum is set up as if Holmes and Dr. Watson still reside there, complete with their private study, laboratory, and personal belongings. Additionally, a plaque commemorating Sherlock Holmes can be found outside the Baker Street tube station in London. Overall, 221B Baker Street has become an iconic fictional address, signifying the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes and the remarkable genius of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's literary creation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” According to the above context, answer the following question. Who got a law degree? A:","output":"Desmond Meade got a law degree."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write a title for this article: Do you care if Wall Street analysts--sometimes referred to as sell-side analysts or, perhaps, Darth Vader sans the warmth--are happy? It would be understandable if you were to say \\"no.\\" It hasn't even been a full decade since those folks inspired as much anger as derivatives traders and mortgage lenders do today. During the technology bubble, their insincere projections and recommendations got the attention of lots of angry people, including then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer who extracted a few pounds of flesh from the banks who employed them. But if the U.S. can become best buddies with Germany and Japan (Does anybody remember World War II?) and if Vietnam can become a tourist destination, surely we can reach a détente with the sell-side community, especially since awareness of what analysts like can actually be profitable.

The Portfolio123 Enhanced Expectations Model looks for that which makes analysts happy: upward-earnings estimate revisions and ratings upgrades. This model selects those that make the top 25 under our Balanced Fundamentals ranking system. In case you're skeptical, balanced fundamentals and analyst favor can go hand in hand. The notion that analysts just talk up their employers' books is a great fantasy for those who need to vent, but it does not accurately reflect reality. Below is a graph going back to 2001 showing how this strategy performed from March 31, 2001, to the present. (The results assume that the list is refreshed once every four weeks.) Enhanced Expectations Screen since 2001 Here is a look at more recent performance, year-to-date since Dec. 31, 2008. The reality is that analysts do have some influence with major institutional investors, and when they turn thumbs-up on shares of fundamentally sound companies, the latter tend to listen, and more importantly, they buy. We don't have to like how Wall Street works. We can wish as hard as we'd like that analysts would stand up and say \\"sell\\" instead of offering milquetoast ratings like \\"market perform\\" to signal bearishness. But we don't rule Wall Street. We just trade in it, and if we're going to do that, a dispassionate acceptance of reality will get us a lot further than whining about an elusive utopia. Several drug stocks and technology companies like JDSU have made money for Turnaround Letter readers. Click here for current buys. Looking at the stocks that have been making analysts smile, I see the full cross section of industry exposure, but can't help noticing the prominence of consumer offerings. Interestingly, though, it's not the likes of Coca Cola ( KO - news - people ) or Wal-Mart ( WMT - news - people ) I'm seeing. Instead, it's mainly lesser names that catch my eye. Consider, for example, warehouse clubs, which you'd think would be worth a look in this still-tight economy. Costco ( COST - news - people ) is king of that hill. But the stock being flagged by the model is one of the other guys, BJ's Wholesale Club ( BJ - news - people ). Interestingly, though, image aside, BJ is holding its own rather nicely with its returns on capital being slightly ahead of five-year averages, in contrast to those of COST, which are a bit down. Meanwhile, BJ's valuation multiples are a bit lower. Gurus urge investors to always buy the \\"best in class\\" (whatever the heck that means). But in fact, sometimes, if the price is right, No. 2, or three or four, may be a better choice. Who is top dog in pizza delivery? Some say Domino's Pizza ( DPZ - news - people ). Others cite the Pizza Hut unit of YUM! Brands ( YUM - news - people ). When it comes to image, few cite Papa John's ( PZZA - news - people ), notwithstanding its advertising slogan \\"Better ingredients, better pizza.\\" Papa John's is the outfit that rose up in our model. Pizza Hut isn't a pure investment play, but between PZZA and DPZ, the latter is a bit more modestly valued and does feature very strong fundamentals. The case for PZZA is that it's much smaller, with about one-third as many stores, indicating more potential for growth. Also, PZZA's fundamentals are trending upward, while with DPZ, what you see is pretty much what you get. First Solar's September calls at the 140 to 150 strikes were huge winners last week.

(Some might say women rule and that the men's category as a whole is also-ran.) When it comes to size, Men's Wearhouse ( MW - news - people ) wins hands down. When it comes to fundamentals, Jos. A Bank ( JOSB - news - people ) is on a high perch. When it comes to our model, the winner is \\"both of the above.\\" Both MW and JOSB sell a lot of business suits and high-grade business casual apparel. In the recent past, analysts haven't been shy about bashing these stocks, citing reduced demand resulting from lackluster employment trends, and rightfully so as it turned out. The fact that stocks like these have now been moving into sell-side favor may be saying something about where analysts expects the economy to go. As to teen apparel, my kid would confirm that nobody who asks what Green Day is has a right to declare anyone a leader or an also-ran. But to the extent teens have been voting with their dollars (or, rather, the dollars that come from parents still willing and able to dole them out), Aeropostale ( ARO - news - people ) is a big gorilla. It also makes our list, suggesting the analysts aren't always going for Brand X. This company's fundamentals are off the charts (in a good way), something that does not appear to be reflected in the stock's ho-hum valuation. Gymboree ( GYMB - news - people ), also on our list, wasn't always a leader in children's apparel. In fact, early in the decade, the company was struggling and the shares were down near penny-stock levels. But the company has been climbing as it's been elbowing its way up the market-share food chain. Whatever happened in the past is over and done with. Now, this is a debt-free high-return multi-chain retailer (besides Gymboree, there's a luxury concept, an outlet chain and a deep discount brand) with reasonable stock valuation metrics.

The premise mentions that the unity among the east coast communities trading with the Thais, Indochinese, and Chinese came from multiple factors, making it impossible to attribute their unity solely to a single shared religion. The factors mentioned in the premise include: 1. Their shared rice economy: This economic factor played a significant role in their unity as they all relied on the rice economy for trade and sustenance. 2. Language: A shared language makes communication and trade easier among the communities, fostering unity and cooperation. 3. Islamic culture: While a shared religion does contribute to their unity and common cultural understanding, Islamic culture encompasses more than just religion. It also includes social norms, customs, and practices that bring these communities closer together. 4. Political and social customs inherited from the Melaka Sultanate: This indicates that the ancestral connections, political structures, and social customs from the Melaka Sultanate played a role in their unity as well.

They keep to themselves, with Edward working as a doctor and Bella as a teacher at the local school. It is apparent that there is a deep connection and love between them, but something is hidden beneath the surface. One day, Bella discovers that she is pregnant and shares the news with Edward, who becomes slightly concerned but tries to keep it hidden. Unknown to Bella, her pregnancy isn't an ordinary one – it's the product of a centuries-old curse tied to their family's bloodline. Jacob, Bella's childhood friend and secret admirer, unexpectedly arrives in town, drawn by an inexplicable force. Upon his arrival, he senses something peculiar about Bella's pregnancy and becomes upset, realizing the potential danger it poses to her life. His own background as a werewolf gives him an insight into the supernatural world from which the threat arises. As the pregnancy progresses, danger and strange occurrences multiply both around Bella and throughout the town. Jacob confronts Edward about the origins of the curse and what it means for Bella's safety, but Edward is unwilling to divulge the complete truth, believing he has the situation under control. Jacob becomes increasingly frustrated and shares his concerns with Bella, urging her to question Edward about their family's history. Despite her initial trust in Edward, Bella's intuition leads her to the discovery of a hidden library filled with knowledge of the dark forces that shroud their family. Together, Jacob and Bella embark on a journey to uncover the truth and break the curse that threatens not only their lives but that of their unborn child. As they delve deeper into the world of shadows, they uncover secrets about their ancestors and the reason behind Edward's initial fear of the child's birth. Throughout their quest, Jacob and Bella encounter various supernatural creatures and must overcome numerous obstacles, ultimately forging a powerful bond between them. Meanwhile, Edward spirals deeper into his own darkness, attempting to find an independent solution that will protect his wife and child. As the climax nears, Jacob and Bella, now fully aware of the curse's origins and consequences, confront Edward. His obsession with maintaining control has blinded him to the damage he has caused, leading to a heated final battle. Together, Bella and Jacob ultimately break the curse, ensuring their child's safety and the future of their once-doomed lineage. In the end, Edward is redeemed, thanks to Bella and Jacob's forgiveness and understanding.

The irish wolfhound Answer:","output":"Title: The Hounds of Eire Genre: Mystery, Adventure, Drama Plot Summary: In the small, picturesque village of Baskerville, located in the heart of the Irish countryside, legends of the Hound of the Baskervilles have haunted the townsfolk for generations. Many believe that the spectral hound, an enormous and terrifying Irish Wolfhound, is a harbinger of doom, appearing to those who are destined to meet a tragic fate. But for others, the Hound of the Baskervilles represents hope, a symbol of the strength and resilience of the Irish people and their culture. The film revolves around two estranged siblings – Isla, an ambitious investigative journalist, and Connor, an urban artist struggling to find his voice – who return to their hometown after the mysterious death of their beloved grandfather. As they settle the affairs of his estate, Isla and Connor uncover letters, journal entries, and artwork that suggests their grandfather, an Irish folk historian, had been researching the legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles for years. Believing that there's more to the legend than meets the eye, the siblings decide to delve deeper into the mystery, hoping to validate their grandfather's study. As they set out on a journey across Ireland to explore the origins of the legend, Isla and Connor find themselves immersed in the rich history, folklore, and magic of the land. Along the way, they encounter several other passionate believers, historical clues, and Celtic motifs that reinforce the importance of the Irish Wolfhound as a symbol of national identity. During their journey, Isla and Connor also come to appreciate the significance of their family's connection to the legend. They learn that their ancestors were among the few who considered the Hound of the Baskervilles a symbol of hope and protection instead of fear, and their family has played a crucial role in preserving the positive aspects of this myth. However, the siblings face numerous challenges while seeking the truth behind the legend. They must confront a heavily biased academic community that dismisses their research as quackery, self-doubt as they inevitably question their own sanity, and a shadowy, nefarious organization determined to suppress the truth about the Hound of the Baskervilles and eliminate those who stand in their way. As the film reaches its climax, Isla and Connor come face to face with the supernatural hound in a breathtaking confrontation during the full moon on an ancient Celtic hillfort. This encounter reveals their family's true connection to the Hound of the Baskervilles and the powerful message it carries. The siblings learn that the hound represents both their family legacy as well as the intrinsic strength and resilience of the Irish people throughout the ages. In the end, the siblings embrace their newfound purpose and understanding of the legend, confidently taking up the mantle of guardians and protectors of the Hound of the Baskervilles myth. The film concludes with Isla and Connor deciding to continue their grandfather's work, ensuring that future generations remember the legend of the Irish Wolfhound and the message of hope it represents for the people of Ireland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What does the author seem to most probably believe about the availability of seasonal produce?

Article: How can you help kids cope with  stress? Proper rest and good nutrition can improve coping skills, so can good parenting. Make time for your kids each day. Whether they need to talk with you or just be in the same room with you, make yourself available. Even as kids get older, quality time is important. It's really hard for some people to come home after a tiring day of work, get down on the floor, and play with their kids or just talk to them about their day -- especially if they've had a stressful day themselves. But expressing interest in your kids shows that they' re important to you. Help your child deal with stress by talking about what may be causing it. Together, you can come up with a few solutions.  For example, he should cut back on after-school activities, spending more time talking with his parents or teachers, developing an exercise plan or keeping a journal. You can also help by predicting potentially stressful situations and preparing kids for them. For example, let a child know ahead of time, but not too far ahead of time, that a doctor's appointment is coming up and talk about what will happen there. Keep in mind, though, that younger kids probably won't need too much advance preparation. Too much information can cause more stress. Remember that some level of stress is normal, Let kids know that it's OK to feel angry, scared, lonely, or anxious and that other people share those feelings, too. When kids can't or won't discuss these problems, try talking about your own concerns. This shows that you're willing to handle tough topics and are available to talk with when they're ready. If a child shows symptoms that concern you and is unwilling to talk, consult a counselor  or other mental health experts. Most parents have the skills to cope with their children's stress. The time to seek professional attention is when any change in behavior continues to exist, when stress is causing serious anxiety, or when the behavior is causing significant problems in functioning at school or at home. Question: Why do some parents feel it difficult to spare quality time for their kids? - Their kids are growing so fast. - They have too much housework. - Their kids are losing interest in them. - They are tired out after work.

Inspired by the success of the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France, the race was first organized in 1935. The race was prevented from being run by the Spanish Civil War and World War II in the early years of its existence; however, the race has been held annually since 1955. As the Vuelta gained prestige and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend all around the globe. Since 1979, the event has been staged and managed by Unipublic, until in 2014, when Amaury Sport Organisation acquired control, with both working together. The peloton expanded from a primarily Spanish participation to include riders from all over the world. The Vuelta is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI ProTeams, with the exception of the wild card teams that the organizers can invite.  - The USA Cycling National Racing Calendar (NRC) is an annual competition of road bicycle racing events held in the United States and sponsored by USA Cycling. The NRC includes a men's and women's individual and team rankings based on points awarded at the events.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve for d in the equation -5*d + 38 + 2 = 0, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the constants in the equation. The equation -5*d + 38 + 2 has two constants, 38 and 2. Combine them: -5*d + (38 + 2) = 0 -5*d + 40 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable (d in this case). To isolate the term with the variable (d), we need to move the constant to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: -5*d + 40 - 40 = 0 - 40 -5*d = -40 Step 3: Solve for the variable d. To solve for d, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is -5 in this case: -5*d / -5 = -40 / -5 d = 8 So, the solution of the equation -5*d + 38 + 2 = 0 is d = 8."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: It's interesting to see how people make use of the time they spend on public transport in Indian cities like Delhi and Mumbai. In crowded buses and trains people manage to take a short nap and some even reach the snoring stage. Or they spread out a newspaper over multiple knees and arms to read about the latest sport results or political crisis. Then there are the experienced travellers who have been playing cards with the same group over the last decade or so. They even have their specific seats so well-worn that you can make out the shape of their backsides. There is no doubt about it. Travelling by public transport is being in the thick of the seasons of life -- a sweaty life in summer where people, blissfully unaware of the rivers of sweat running down their brows and inside their clothes. At the first smell of a perfumed man or woman boarding the stuffy bus or train, most people feel they are reborn. During the rains you can't avoid getting wet or muddied. The windows, almost always, are not a perfect fit and if you're not drenched by a sudden, heavy rain shower then you are bound to catch a jet spray of muddy water caused by a fellow motorist driving fast through a puddle. Rains are a perfect time for people to switch their old umbrellas for new ones. Since there are so many that look alike, it's impossible to tell whose is whose. Winter is the time when it feels good -- or at least warm -- to be part of a crowd. It is amazing how much the collective breaths of a 100 or so people can raise the freezing temperature inside. Looking at the masses dressed in their bright red pullovers or green coats, it's fun to imagine what faces lie beneath their dark woolen hats. The cold winter passes, making way for spring. It is impossible not to see every little flower by the wayside blooming proudly. And the warm sun manages to transmit some of their pleasantness to the inside of a bus or train.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: When someone puts you down, deal with it by not immediately reacting to him. Giving a quick comeback or getting angry will reinforce his behavior. It gives him what he wants — a response from you.. Also, it's not good for you to act out of anger or other negative emotions. You could do or say something you will regret, or you could damage yourself with stress.   Take a deep breath or two. This will help you to remain calm. Slowly count to five while you make sure you are calm. You may want to respond with a put-down of your own, but doing this can make you seem as petty as her. It can also increase the tension, and really won't solve the problem.  Just like reacting immediately, retaliating gives her what she wants. Even though you might want to, don't reply to rude comments and posts online with mean posts of your own. Avoid gossiping about her later. It may feel good in the moment, but does nothing to solve the problem. Sometimes silence can be the best weapon. Ignoring someone that is putting you down denies them the pleasure of a response from you.  It keeps you from wasting time and energy on someone that isn't worth it. Plus, her bad behavior will really stand out against your good behavior.  Just act as though she didn't say anything. Continue doing what you were doing without giving her a glance. Unless the person is incredibly thick-headed, she will usually leave you alone after being ignored. This is a clear way to let the person know that you want him to quit putting you down. If ignoring the person didn't work or if the situation is especially annoying or hurtful, telling him to stop can help resolve the problem.  Make sure you are calm. Look him in the eyes and use a controlled, confident, clear voice. For example, if a peer insults you, take a few deep breaths and then calmly say, “Stop putting me down.” With a co-worker, you might try saying, “I don't like or appreciate how you are talking to me and about me. I want you to stop putting me down.” If it's a friend that may not actually be trying to be mean, you might say, “I know you didn't mean to, but what you said hurt my feelings. Please don't put me down like that.” Summary:","output":"When someone is mean to you or makes you feel bad, try not to react right away. Getting angry or upset can actually make them continue to be mean. Instead, take deep breaths and count to five to stay calm. Don't speak back to them with mean words, this can just make the situation worse. One of the best things you can do is to ignore them. If they continue to bother you, try telling them in a clear and confident voice to stop.

As an important railroad and road junction and production center, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (Stöcken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Forced labourers were sometimes used from the Hannover-Misburg subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp. Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city center was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids. After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Which campaign specifically targeted Hanover during World War I?","output":"There was no specific bombing campaign that targeted Hanover during World War I. Aerial bombing campaigns, as we know them from World War II, were in their infancy during World War I, and the technology available at the time was not as advanced as it was during World War II. During World War I, aircraft were primarily used for reconnaissance, and to some extent, bombing raids were carried out, but these were less strategic and less frequent compared to the large-scale strategic bombing campaigns seen in World War II. Hanover, as an industrial center, might have been potentially targeted during air raids in World War I; however, it did not suffer a specific campaign like the Oil Campaign during World War II. In general, World War I was characterized by trench warfare, with artillery serving as the primary means of inflicting damage on enemy lines, and aviation playing a supplementary role. The strategic bombing campaigns that targeted cities and industrial centers in an attempt to cripple enemy war production became more prevalent and widespread in World War II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which entity is this text about? Vlade Divac (Serbian Cyrillic: Vlade Divats, pronounced [vla:de di:vats]; born February 3, 1968) is a Serbian professional basketball executive and former player, currently serving as the vice president of basketball operations and general manager of the Sacramento Kings. Divac spent most of his career in the National Basketball Association (NBA). At 7 ft 1 in, he played center and was known for his passing skills. He was among the first group of European basketball players to transfer to the NBA in the late 1980s and was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors. In late 2000, following the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic whose policies Divac had been openly critical of throughout mid-to-late 1990s, Divac and former teammate Predrag Danilovic took over their former club KK Partizan. They did so on initiative by Ivica Dacic, the club's outgoing president and, more importantly, a suddenly marginalized politician who, due to his association with Milosevic, was forced to leave his post at the club. Seeing that various state-owned companies and community property were being taken over in a dubious manner during the power vacuum that resulted from regime change, Dacic saw it prudent to bring the club's two former greats as a safeguard against the same happening to KK Partizan. Divac became the club's president while Danilovic took the vice-president role.  Freshly retired from playing, Danilovic was actually running the club's day-to-day operations since Divac was still very actively involved with the Sacramento Kings at the time. The head coach they inherited, Darko Russo, finished out the 2000-01 season before they decided in summer 2001 to bring back their mentor Dusko Vujosevic to be the new head coach.  Though the duo never stated so outright, their additional motivation in getting involved with KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the Serbian parliament. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, at least until the law appears. Divac and Danilovic appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continued to be involved with it in a lesser capacity for a few years afterwards.

But analysis of House of Commons Library figures last week by the Press Association suggests it could be the biggest 12-month period we've had. In the financial year 2015-16, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) reckons the government could raise about £32bn from selling public assets, the biggest chunk of which would be about £13bn from the sale of the government's stake in Lloyds Banking Group, followed closely by about £12bn from the sale of UK Asset Resolution, which owns the remaining bits of Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley. Other big price-tag sales include more of the government's stake in RBS, Royal Mail and the Student Loan book. PA adjusted previous years of privatisations to current money and found that 2015-16 would be the biggest year for privatisations by far. The previous high-water marks had been 1987 when chunks of BA, BAA, BP and Rolls-Royce raised about £22.7bn in today's money, and 1991 when the sale of parts of BT, National Power, PowerGen and regional electricity companies in Scotland raised about £22.6bn. Now, these figures are not perfect - for starters we are comparing a financial year, 2015-16, with previous calendar years. Also, IFS director Paul Johnson's recent review of inflation statistics warned against the use of RPI for anything whatsoever as a result of its statistical flaws. Even so, the difference between 2015-16 and any year since the start of the Thatcher era in 1979 is startling. The OBR suggests that we won't be seeing another year like it any time soon, predicting total proceeds of £32bn from the rest of the remaining four years of the parliament put together. But that figure is only made up of continuing sales of the RBS stake and the Student Loans book. The Conservatives' manifesto this year was very clear that the party planned to continue selling stakes in bailed-out banks and building societies and also that it would continue to sell unneeded government property. But there was no mention of any of the other rumoured sales such as the Royal Mint or the Met Office. The sale of the government's stake in Eurostar has been announced, but there are still difficulties in the sale of the stake in Urenco, which is a supplier of nuclear fuel. It's important to remember what the sale of public assets does for the public finances. It does not reduce the deficit, which is the amount the government needs to borrow in a year. It does reduce the country's overall debt, which also reduces the amount of interest that has to be paid each year. On the other hand, while the government gets cash upfront when it privatises something, it loses its share of any profits that might have been made in the future. This article was about:","output":"The article discusses the analysis of House of Commons Library figures that indicate that the financial year 2015-16 could be the biggest 12-month period for selling public assets in the UK. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that the government could raise approximately £32bn from the sale of these assets. The largest portions of this would come from the sales of the government's stake in Lloyds Banking Group, UK Asset Resolution, more of the government's stake in RBS, Royal Mail, and the Student Loan book. This analysis suggests that 2015-16 would be the largest year for privatizations, surpassing previous records set in 1987 and 1991. The article also highlights that selling public assets does not reduce the deficit, but rather reduces the country's overall debt and the amount of interest paid each year. However, the government loses its share of potential future profits from privatized assets."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Explanation: The correct answer is option iii because it continues focusing on warming up and stretching the necessary muscles for performing a backbend. It ensures your shoulders are prepared for the arching motion. Option i is incorrect because it introduces a different stretch (planks and valley position) that doesn't directly relate to backbends and seems out of context. Option ii is wrong because it talks about losing tension while stretching and is too focused on specific muscles instead of preparing the body for a backbend.

Given the question: Information:  - Carposinidae , the \`\` fruitworm moths '' is a family of insects in the lepidopteran order . These moths are narrower winged than Copromorphidae , with less rounded forewing tips . Males often have conspicuous patches of scales on either surface ( Dugdale et al. , 1999 ) . The mouthparts are quite diagnostic , usually with prominent , upcurved \`\` labial palps '' , the third segment long ( especially in females ) , and the second segment covered in large scales . Unlike Copromorphidae , the \`\` M2 '' and sometimes \`\` M1 '' vein on the hindwings is absent . The relationship of Carposinidae relative to Copromorphidae needs further investigation . It is considered possible that the family is artificial , being nested within Copromorphidae ( Dugdale et al. , 1999 ) . The Palearctic species have been revised by Diakonoff ( 1989 ) .  - A pupa (Latin \\"pupa\\" for doll, plural: \\"pupae\\" or \\"pupas\\") is the life stage of some insects undergoing transformation. The pupal stage is found only in holometabolous insects, those that undergo a complete metamorphosis, going through four life stages: embryo, larva, pupa and imago.  - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.  - Caterpillar is the common name for the larvae of members of the order Lepidoptera (the insect order comprising butterflies and moths).  - Copromorphoidea, the \\"fruitworm moths\\" is a superfamily of insects in the lepidopteran order. These moths are small to medium-sized (1050 mm. in wingspan) and are broad-winged bearing some resemblance to the superfamilies Tortricoidea and Immoidea. The antennae are often \\"pectinate\\" especially in males, and many species of these well camouflaged moths bear raised tufts of scales on the wings and a specialised fringe of scales at the base of the hindwing sometimes in females only; there are a number of other structural characteristics (Common, 1990; Dugdale et al., 1999) . The position of this superfamily is not certain, but it has been placed in the natural group of \\"Apoditrysia\\" \\"Obtectomera\\" (Minet, 1991), rather than with the superfamilies Alucitoidea or Epermenioidea within which it has sometimes previously been placed, on the grounds that shared larval and pupal characteristics of these groups have probably evolved independently. It has been suggested that the division into two families should be abandoned (e.g. Holloway et al., 2001).  - Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.  - Copromorphidae, the \\"tropical fruitworm moths\\" is a family of insects in the lepidopteran order. These moths have broad, rounded forewings, and well-camouflaged scale patterns. Unlike Carposinidae the mouthparts include \\"labial palps\\" with the second rather than third segment the longest. The position of the enigmatic New Zealand genus \\"Isonomeutis\\" in this family in uncertain, as it lacks the flimsy cuticle of the pupa characteristic of other Copromorphoidea. With other unusual structural characteristics of the caterpillar and adult, it could represent the sister lineage of all other extant members of this superfamily (Dugdale et al., 1999). The genus \\"Sisyroxena\\" from Madagascar is also notable for its unusual venation and wing scale sockets (Dugdale et al., 1999).  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.

Background: Triumph is a Canadian hard rock band formed in 1975 that was popular in the late 1970s and the 1980s, building on its reputation and success as a live band. Between the band's 16 albums and DVDs, Triumph has received 18 gold and 9 platinum awards in Canada and the United States. Triumph was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, including Group of the Year Award in 1979, 1985, 1986, and 1987. Triumph is most known for its guitar-driven rock songs, such as \\"Lay It on the Line\\", \\"Magic Power\\", \\"Fight the Good Fight\\", and \\"World of Fantasy\\". Context: Guitarist Emmett's songwriting style showed a progressive rock influence, as well as displaying his classical music influence; each Triumph album included a classical guitar solo piece. Moore also doubled as lead singer on many of the band's heavier songs and in their later years, some softer ballads; bassist and pianist Levine produced their early albums. Triumph's style proved unpopular with rock critics, much like many progressive rock and heavy metal bands. Rolling Stone reviewers labeled them a \\"faceless band.\\"  Moore and Levine scouted Emmett one summer night in 1975 at a west-end Toronto club on The Queensway, called The Hollywood Tavern, where Emmett was playing in a band called ACT III. The three musicians subsequently got together for a jam session in the basement of Moore's house in Mississauga, after which Moore and Levine showed Emmett promo materials and contracts they had already secured for gigs starting in September of that year. They offered Emmett a guaranteed minimum weekly paycheck of 175, and Emmett agreed to join as an equal founding partner.  Triumph's first paid concert was at Simcoe High School on September 19, 1975, for 750. By August 26, 1978 they were headliners at the Canada Jam Festival at Mosport Park playing before a crowd of 110,000 people.  Triumph signed their first record deal with Attic Records in Canada. They later signed with RCA Records in the US covering all areas except Canada. After the RCA deal ended in acrimony, MCA Records picked up the band and re-released all their music to date in 1984. After the shift to MCA, the band began to work with outside producers, and their studio albums became increasingly difficult to replicate onstage. Triumph later added Rick Santers, a Toronto guitar and keyboard player, to support their last three tours.  Triumph's first album (originally self-titled but later renamed In the Beginning) was rare outside Canada, but their widely released second LP, Rock & Roll Machine, received some scattered airplay in the US, with Gil Moore's cover of Joe Walsh's \\"Rocky Mountain Way.\\" In mid 1978 Triumph subbed in for Sammy Hagar on an FM radio-station promotion date in San Antonio, Texas, followed by a run of 5 shows in Texas for JAM Productions (a promoter named Joe Anthony), then toured across Canada with fellow Canadian rockers Moxy and Trooper. San Antonio remained a popular location for the trio throughout its career. Question: What was there first album?

In 1963 when zip codes were assigned, the section of Levittown in Oyster Bay was given a Hicksville, New York zip code and has since been part of Hicksville. Joel's father, Howard (born Helmuth) Joel, a classical pianist, was born in Germany, to a Jewish family, the son of a merchant and manufacturer, Karl Amson Joel. Howard emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States (via Cuba, as immigration quotas for German Jews prevented direct immigration at the time) to escape the Nazi regime. Influenced by early-rock-and-roll and rhythm-and-blues artists, including groups such as The Beatles, The Drifters and The Four Seasons, he favored tightly-structured pop melodies and down-to-earth, unpretentious songwriting.  After seeing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, Joel decided to pursue a career in music. In an interview he said of the group's impact, \\"That one performance changed my life ... Up to that moment I'd never considered playing rock as a career. And when I saw four guys who didn't look like they'd come out of the Hollywood star mill, who played their own songs and instruments, and especially because you could see this look in John Lennon's face - and he looked like he was always saying: 'F--- you!' - I said: 'I know these guys, I can relate to these guys, I am these guys.' This is what I'm going to do - play in a rock band'.\\"  Joel joined the Echoes, a group that specialized in British Invasion covers. The Echoes began recording in 1965. Joel (then 16) also played piano on several records released through Kama Sutra Productions and on recordings produced by Shadow Morton. Joel played on a demo version of \\"Leader of the Pack\\", which would become a major hit for the Shangri-Las. Joel states that in 1964 he played on a recording of the Shangri-Las' \\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\\" but he is unaware of whether he played on the demo or master version; The released single included a co-producer credit for Artie Ripp, who later was the first to sign and produce Joel as a solo artist after Michael Lang, who had given Joel a monetary advance, passed Joel along to Ripp to focus his attentions elsewhere instead.  In late 1965, the Echoes changed their name to the Emeralds and then to the Lost Souls. Joel left the band in 1967 to join the Hassles, a Long Island group that had signed with United Artists Records. Over the next year and a half they released four singles and two albums (The Hassles and Hour of the Wolf). All were commercial failures. Joel and drummer Jon Small left the Hassles in 1969 to form the duo Attila, releasing an eponymous debut album in July 1970.

Plot title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored.

At least 41 members of Boko Haram  have been killed in clashes with the army in Cameroon this weekend, the government said today. The Cameroonian army launched a series of air strikes and on-the-ground attacks on the  militant Islamist group after it crossed the border and seized a military base. President Paul Biya personally ordered the retaliation attack which forced Boko Haram  to flee the military base at Assighasia, a government representative said in a statement late Sunday. Fighting back: At least 41 members of Boko Haram, pictured is their leader Abubakar Shekau, were killed in several retaliation attacks by the Cameroonian Army this weekend. 'Fighter planes went into action for the first time since the start of the conflict on the Cameroonian side of the frontier, after several months of deadly cross-border Boko Haram raids', Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said. 'After two strikes and heavy fire... the assailants fled the Assighasia camp... losing several fighters,' he said. Military operations were still under way, he added, saying that 'the toll from combat will be released once the operational evaluation is complete'. The extremists of Boko Haram, have made frequent raids into neighbouring Cameroon since they began their insurgency in northern Nigeria in 2009. Orders: The attacks against Boko Haram were ordered by Cameroon's president Paul Biya. Boko Haram tactics include massacres of civilians on both sides of the frontier, bomb attacks on state institutions and schools, and the razing of villages and mass kidnappings. Since early in 2014, the movement has sent growing numbers of fighters into Cameroon, prepared to battle the army head-on as well as attacking and intimidating villagers. On October 15, Boko Haram forces equipped with a captured tank and an armoured vehicle attacked a military base at Amchide, near the border, in a raid that killed several dozen civilians and eight soldiers, according to officials. The air strikes marked 'a new escalation in the Cameroonian response... to multiple enemy attacks by the Boko Haram terrorist group,' the statement said, but it also sent a signal to other countries. Cameroon's neighbours, together with former colonial power France, have long criticised the authorities for what they considered a passive response to the actions of the jihadist movement even as its members used Cameroonian territory to rest and buy food and weapons. When a French family was kidnapped in 2013, along with two Italian priests and a Canadian nun, President Biya sent major army reinforcements to confront the Islamists in 'Operation Alpha'. The hostages were freed this year in Nigeria. Some 2,000 Cameroonian troops patrol the far-north region, but security sources say that many more are needed because the area is so remote with a very porous border. Military sources accuse Nigeria's army of failing to do enough against jihadist forces who have taken control of large swathes of the northeast of the country. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- At least 41 Boko Haram members were killed in clashes with the Cameroonian army this weekend. - The Cameroonian army launched air strikes and on-the-ground attacks against the group after it seized a military base. - Cameroon's President Paul Biya personally ordered the retaliation attack, forcing Boko Haram to flee the military base at Assighasia. - This marked the first time fighter planes were used since the start of the conflict on the Cameroonian side of the border. - Boko Haram has made frequent raids into neighboring Cameroon since the beginning of their insurgency in northern Nigeria in 2009. - The Cameroonian response marks a new escalation in the fight against the jihadist group and sends a signal to neighboring countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  Two neighboring towns used different approaches to agriculture. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods.  Which town had less growth of algae because of fertilizer? The answer to this question is:","output":"Small town had less growth of algae because of fertilizer. Step 1: Understanding the problem The problem states that there are two neighboring towns with different approaches to agriculture. Big town uses pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town uses permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Step 2: Identifying the cause of algae growth The cause of algae growth mentioned in the problem is the presence of dissolved fertilizer in the water bodies due to runoff from farm fields. Step 3: Comparing the agricultural practices of both towns Big town uses pesticides and fertilizers in their agriculture, which have been identified as a cause of algae growth when they end up in water bodies. Small town, on the other hand, applies permaculture principles and organic farming methods, which do not involve the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Step 4: Analyzing the impact of agricultural practices on algae growth Since chemical fertilizers are a major cause of algae growth, it can be concluded that Big town would be more likely to have issues with algae growth in nearby water bodies. Small town, with its organic farming practices, would have less of an impact on algae growth due to the absence of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Step 5: Conclusion Based on the information provided and the analysis of the agricultural practices of both towns, it can be concluded that Small town had less growth of algae because of fertilizer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process:  - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it takes longer for rocks to break down happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"If the process of rocks breaking down takes longer, there will be a direct effect on the rate of weathering. Weathering is the process by which rocks and minerals are broken down into smaller particles through various physical, chemical, and biological processes. In the given process, the main factors contributing to the breakdown of rocks are the freeze-thaw cycle, temperature changes, and water seepage. If rocks take longer to break down, this implies that the rate at which these processes occur has decreased. This can be due to several reasons, such as a change in climate conditions, the composition of rocks, or a decrease in the availability of water. As a result, weathering would occur at a slower rate, leading to a decrease in the overall pace of landscape transformation. However, it's also important to consider that the interactions between different weathering processes can lead to indirect effects on the rate of weathering. For example, a slower rate of mechanical weathering (physical breakdown of rocks) might lead to a reduced availability of fresh surface area for chemical weathering to occur, thus indirectly slowing down the overall weathering process. Alternatively, slower mechanical weathering could potentially result in larger fragments of rocks that are less susceptible to further physical breakdown and therefore reduce the overall weathering rate. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of rocks taking longer to break down would directly affect the rate of weathering by slowing it down. This slower rate of weathering could, in turn, have indirect effects on the interactions between different weathering processes, potentially leading to an even slower overall rate of weathering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Will I be discriminated against by my friends?\\" Please tell me if those questions are the same. pick from the following. (i). no (ii). yes","output":"(i). no The two questions are not the same, as they address different topics. The first question pertains to the possibility of human beings traveling one Planck's time (approximately 5.39 × 10^(-44) seconds) for one Planck length (approximately 1.62 × 10^(-35) meters). Planck units, such as Planck time and Planck length, are fundamental parameters derived from physical constants like the speed of light, gravitational constant, and the Planck constant. They represent the smallest possible units of time and distance that can be meaningfully quantified, according to the current understanding of physics. In terms of human travel, moving one Planck length in one Planck time is beyond the scope of our current capabilities. The restrictions of the speed of light, combined with our present technological limitations, make this feat impossible. Additionally, such incredible speeds would also require an immense amount of energy that is impractical with today's technology. Lastly, it is also important to understand that traversing such minuscule distances in such infinitesimally short periods may not have any feasible practical applications. On the other hand, the second question relates to social interactions and potential discrimination based on height. It asks whether a 5'5\\" tall Australian male would be discriminated against by his friends. This query involves subjective experiences and interpersonal dynamics, which are quite distinct from the first question's focus on physics and technology. Discrimination could occur in various forms and depends on factors such as cultural norms, personal biases, and general attitudes towards height differences. However, it is crucial to remember that people's experiences will differ based on their social circle, values, and perceptions. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same because the first one concerns the scientific possibility of extremely fast and short travel, while the second one addresses the social dynamics and potential discrimination based on height."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City.  and a hint : Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Please answer this question : Which city experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking? Answer:","output":"Based on the given situation and hint, Tokyo experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking than Kansas City.  The primary reason behind this conclusion is the earthquake frequency and location of the two cities. Tokyo is located near the boundaries of four tectonic plates: the Pacific Plate, the Philippine Sea Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the North American Plate. This proximity to multiple plate boundaries makes Tokyo one of the most seismically active cities in the world. The tectonic plates' movement due to convection within the Earth causes stress to build up in the rocks near the plate boundaries. When this stress surpasses the rocks' capacity, they break, leading to earthquakes. Kansas City, on the other hand, is situated in the central United States and is not near any tectonic plate boundaries. Consequently, this region experiences far fewer earthquakes than Tokyo. The central U.S. is part of the North American Plate, which is relatively stable compared to the boundaries of multiple tectonic plates in areas like Tokyo. As a result, there is less stress build-up and fewer instances of rocks breaking in Kansas City. The Elastic Rebound Theory explains how earthquakes occur due to the sudden release of energy when rocks break to relieve accumulated stress. When an earthquake happens, the rocks typically move several centimeters, and in rare cases, a few meters. As Tokyo experiences a significantly higher frequency of earthquakes compared to Kansas City, it's reasonable to conclude that more energy is released in Tokyo due to rocks breaking than in Kansas City. This energy release is primarily due to Tokyo's location near multiple tectonic plate boundaries, leading to frequent stress build-up and subsequent earthquakes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Question: \\"Who was the final enemy that were being patrolled for?\\"  Context: \\"Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of 5.8 km2 (2.2 sq mi) of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by US Air Force transport and refuelling aircraft and by US Navy aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first German and, later, Soviet. The principal installation, Kindley Air Force Base on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated Naval Air Station Bermuda. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and Canadian Forces aircraft.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The final enemy that was being patrolled for in the context of Bermuda's airbases were Soviet submarines. During the earlier years of operation, the US Air Force transport and refuelling aircraft, as well as the US Navy aircraft, patrolled the Atlantic for German enemy submarines. However, as the global political scenario evolved, their focus shifted to patrolling for Soviet submarines during the Cold War era. The construction of the airbases, which began in 1941, played a significant role in maintaining a strong military presence in the Atlantic region. The strategic location of Bermuda allowed the military to effectively monitor and counter the activities of enemy submarines. The airbases, including the Kindley Air Force Base that later became the Naval Air Station Bermuda, facilitated coordination between the US Air Force and Navy, and hosted various transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft. Additionally, these bases also supported transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and Canadian Forces aircraft, strengthening the collective defense capabilities of the allied forces. With the end of the Cold War, the threat perception from Soviet submarines dwindled, leading to a change in the focus of military activities in the region. Nonetheless, it's important to understand that throughout their operational history, Bermuda's airbases served a crucial role in deterring potential enemies, safeguarding both the immediate region and wider transatlantic interests. The fact that these bases were involved in patrolling for German and later Soviet submarines highlights the changing dynamics of global conflicts during the 20th century and the adaptability of military strategies, deployments, and alliances to address evolving threats."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. It is obvious that John is a fool. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence? Choices: [I] unacceptable [II] acceptable","output":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"It is obvious that John is a fool\\" can be examined from various aspects, including grammar, syntax, style, and semantics. Let us engage in a detailed analysis of these dimensions before determining its level of acceptability. 1. Grammar: The sentence is structurally sound from the perspective of grammar. It consists of a complete subject (\\"It\\") and a predicate (\\"is obvious that John is a fool\\") that contains a linking verb (\\"is\\") followed by an adjective (\\"obvious\\"). Additionally, the object complement clause (\\"that John is a fool\\") specifies further detail to the adjective, rendering the sentence grammatically correct. 2. Syntax: Analyzing the sentence from a syntactical standpoint, it follows the conventional subject-verb-object pattern in English. The subject \\"It\\" starts the sentence, followed by the verb \\"is\\" and followed by the adjective \\"obvious,\\" which is then supplemented by the complement clause \\"that John is a fool\\" to describe John's perceived foolishness. The sentence follows standard English syntax rules and is coherent. 3. Style: From a stylistic perspective, the sentence employs the use of a placeholder subject \\"It,\\" which is a common technique in English. This placeholder is used when the true subject of the sentence is a verb or a propositional phrase that is not ideally used at the beginning of a sentence. In this case, the true subject is the complement clause \\"that John is a fool,\\" while its placeholder is \\"It,\\" enabling the sentence to flow smoothly. The sentence is therefore stylistically acceptable. 4. Semantics: In terms of semantics, the sentence conveys a clear and unambiguous meaning. It asserts that the speaker believes John's foolishness to be evident and apparent. While the statement is subjective and a judgment of John's character, the intended meaning is apparent to the reader or listener. Taking into account the above analysis related to grammar, syntax, style, and semantics, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"It is obvious that John is a fool\\" can be deemed acceptable. However, it is important to note that the tone of the sentence is judgmental and potentially offensive, which should be considered in the context of where it is utilized and among whom it is shared. Thus, considering the linguistic components analyzed, the sentence can be classified as: [II] Acceptable"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Wenn durch Chinas steigenden Wohlstand irgendetwas verloren ging, dann die tröstliche Vorstellung, dass Kapitalismus und eine wachsende Schicht wohlhabenden Bürgertums unweigerlich zu einer liberalen Demokratie führen. Which language is this?","output":"The language of the text provided is German. The text discusses the notion that China's increasing prosperity has discredited the comforting idea that capitalism and a growing affluent middle class inevitably lead to a liberal democracy. Here's a more detailed translation and discussion about the topic: The text states that if anything has been lost due to China's rising prosperity, it is the comforting idea that capitalism and a growing middle class of affluent citizens inevitably lead to a liberal democracy. This idea was prevalent in the past, particularly during the period following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. As China has experienced tremendous economic growth in recent decades, it has not transitioned to a liberal democracy as some theorists may have predicted. Instead, China has maintained a one-party system under the Communist Party of China, while successfully growing its economy and raising the living standards of its citizens. China's economic success and growth have been primarily driven by a mix of market-oriented reforms and state intervention, with the Communist Party remaining firmly in control. This has led some experts to question the traditional belief that capitalism and an expanding middle class would inevitably lead to democratization. Some explanations for this phenomenon include: 1. The nature of China's political system: China's one-party system grants the Communist Party significant control over the nation's resources, media, and decision-making process. 2. The role of Confucian values: Traditional Confucian values, which emphasize social harmony and respect for authority, may be contributing to the acceptance of a one-party system in China. 3. Economic growth as a priority: The Chinese government has made economic growth a top priority, which has kept the population satisfied and has maintained social stability, reducing the urgency for democratic change. 4. The use of digital surveillance and social control: Emerging technologies, such as social credit systems and digital surveillance, are being used by the Chinese government to monitor and control its citizens, limiting dissent and the potential for democratic change. In conclusion, the case of China's rising prosperity and its continued adherence to a one-party system challenges the conventional wisdom that capitalism and a growing affluent middle class will inevitably result in a liberal democracy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although words related in form or meaning, e.g. Hellenist (Ancient Greek: Ἑλληνιστής, Hellēnistēs), have been attested since ancient times, it was J. G. Droysen in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work Geschichte des Hellenismus, i.e. History of Hellenism, coined the term Hellenistic to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander’s conquest. Following Droysen, Hellenistic and related terms, e.g. Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold, where Hellenism is used in contrast with Hebraism.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, the text does not directly answer the question \\"Which of the following was born earlier: Droysen or Alexander?\\" However, we can infer the answer by analyzing the given details. The excerpt states that J.G. Droysen coined the term \\"Hellenistic\\" in the mid-19th century in his work \\"Geschichte des Hellenismus,\\" to define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander's conquest. From this, it is apparent that Droysen lived and pursued his academic work in the 19th century. On the other hand, Alexander, to whom this text refers, is likely to be Alexander the Great, a renowned king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon, who ruled between 356 and 323 BCE. The term \\"Hellenistic period\\" was created to describe the era right after Alexander's conquests, during which Greek culture and influence spread across the non-Greek world. Given these historical contexts, it is clear that Alexander was born earlier than J.G. Droysen. Alexander the Great lived during the 4th century BCE, while Droysen was a 19th-century figure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Valentine’s Day sucks. Which may sound odd coming from someone who ceaselessly praises love and sex, but it is true. I am not a fan. My mother and father were married in a small Baptist Church on Valentine’s Day in 1959. They are no longer together. They are still technically married but my father now lives in a residential care home for dementia patients and my mother lives alone. My father’s disease makes him angry and aggressive leaving my mother with blurred and fading memories of his kindness. It is a sad day for all those whose partners are transformed into strangers by illnesses. Some things aren’t fair. It is my step(ish) daughter’s birthday on Valentine’s Day (I am not married to my boyfriend so I can’t claim to be a step-mum and there is no other term for it). The end of my boyfriend’s marriage has put continents between him and his children. When he hangs up the phone after talking to his daughter, his eyes are dark with pain. It is a sad day for all those whose love is diluted by oceans. Some things can’t be changed. I remember the last Valentine’s Day I spent with my ex-husband. I was a couple of weeks away from moving out but I hadn’t told him yet. I felt sick and scared and heartbroken. My husband and I passed the entire day without speaking. As I stood on the edge of the cliff summoning up the courage to jump, I felt entirely alone. It is a sad day for all those whose love has withered away. Some things can’t be fixed. I want to believe that “love is all you need” because it feels as though it could almost be true, but then I remember, on days like this, that for as many hearts that sing, there are equally as many that struggle to beat. Question: Why does the author dislike Valentines day? Answer: A:","output":"The author dislikes Valentine's Day for several deeply personal reasons that stem from the complicated and painful experiences of love, separation and heartache involving themselves and the people closest to them. Firstly, their parents were married on Valentine's Day, but since then, their father developed dementia and became aggressive, tarnishing their mother's fond memories of his kindness. Their relationship has now dissolved, their father living in a residential care home and their mother alone, making Valentine's Day a reminder of the love that was lost due to illness. Secondly, the author's step(ish)daughter's birthday falls on Valentine's Day as well. Her boyfriend, who is the father of the child, had his marriage end and is now geographically distanced from his kids. The pain and longing that her boyfriend experiences after talking to his daughter, particularly on this day, serve as a reminder of how love can be diluted and separated by factors beyond anyone's control. Lastly, the author recalls a Valentine's Day spent with their ex-husband, during which they did not speak and faced the reality of their failing marriage. This memory highlights how love can wither away and the heartache these situations can bring. For the author, Valentine's Day serves as a stark reminder of the harsh realities of love and relationships, rather than being a celebration of love and happiness that it's typically associated with. Their dislike for the day stems from the confluence of all these personal experiences and the acknowledgment that sometimes love isn't enough to mend broken hearts or relationships."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

He began his career as a dissident working towards the independence and unity of the Ottoman Empire 's Arab territories and was consequently imprisoned and tortured for his activism . When the Kingdom of Syria was established , Quwatli became a government official , though he was disillusioned with monarchism and co-founded the republican Independence Party . Quwatli was immediately sentenced to death by the French who took control over Syria in 1920 . Afterward , he based himself in Cairo where he served as the chief ambassador of the Syrian - Palestinian Congress , cultivating particularly strong ties with Saudi Arabia .

He subsequently went into exile in Egypt , returning to Syria in 1955 to participate in the presidential election , which he won . A conservative presiding over an increasingly leftist - dominated government , Quwatli officially adopted neutralism amid the Cold War . After his request for aid from the United States was denied , he drew closer to the Eastern bloc . He also entered Syria into a defense arrangement with Egypt and Saudi Arabia to confront the influence of the Baghdad Pact . In 1957 , Quwatli , who the US and the Pact countries failed to oust , sought to stem the leftist tide in Syria , but to no avail . By then , his political authority had receded as the military increasingly bypassed Quwatli 's jurisdiction by separately coordinating with Quwatli 's erstwhile backer , Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser . In 1958 , after months of unity talks , Quwatli merged Syria with Egypt to form the...  - The Great Syrian Revolt or Great Druze Revolt (19251927) was a general uprising across Mandatory Syria and Lebanon aimed at getting rid of the French, who had been in control of the region since the end of World War I.

An outspoken Shiite prayer leader who demonstrators say was arrested last Friday was a focal point of the \\"day of rage\\" protest, said Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society. Sheikh Tawfeeq Al-Amer was arrested Friday after a sermon stating that Saudi Arabia should become a constitutional monarchy, al-Mugaiteeb said. Saudi Arabian authorities could not be immediately reached for comment. The protest comes on the heels of two similar demonstrations held in the province Thursday, al-Mugaiteeb said, when about 200 protesters in the city of Qatif and 100 protesters in the city of Awamiyya called for the release of Shiite prisoners. Al-Mugaiteeb said authorities arrested 22 people who participated in Thursday's protest in Qatif. \\"We deplore this action by the Saudi security forces,\\" he said. Another protest took place in Riyadh after Friday prayer, according to two Saudi activists. The sources asked not to be identified because of concerns for their safety. According to the activists, as many as 40 anti-government demonstrators gathered outside Al-Rajhi Mosque for a short protest. At least one man involved in organizing the protest was arrested by Saudi police, the activists said. The activists said the protesters attracted a crowd of worshipers leaving the mosque. Some of the protesters carried signs showing a map of Saudi Arabia that did not contain the words \\"Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\\" a clear affront to the Saudi royal family. Saudi Arabia has cracked down on protests in the past. Shiites are a minority in Saudi Arabia. They live primarily in the Eastern Province -- where many major oil companies operate. The protests come as sectarian violence between Shiites and Sunnis flares in neighboring Bahrain. Analysts believe protests in Bahrain could spill over into Saudi Arabia's oil fields, located mostly in Shiite provinces. After three months abroad for medical treatment, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah returned home late last month to a Middle East shaken by unrest, and announced a series of sweeping measures aimed at relieving economic hardship and meeting with Bahrain's beleaguered monarch. The Saudi government released three Shiite political prisoners ahead of the king's return.

Article: If you are considering reporting your boss for their behavior, pause before going to upper level management.  First, have a talk with your boss to see if things improve.  There could be things going on in their life that you don’t know about or perhaps they are frustrated with your work as of late.  During a time of calmness, approach them and see if they have a few minutes to talk.  If they are typically very busy, then set up a meeting beforehand. Say something like “I really enjoy working here but sometimes, especially in the mornings, you yell at me and other team members.  That makes it hard for me to want to work hard for you because I am frustrated.  Is there anything going on with you right now or anything that I can do better or differently? Try to manage your own emotional reaction to keep from inflaming the problem. Moodiness might cause your boss to accuse you of poor performance, even when you are doing your best at your job.  By keeping detailed records of what the boss has asked of you, including asking for clarifications, extensions, and changes to your work, you can provide proof when your moody boss accuses you of not following directions. It's not your place to prevent their moodiness, but it is your place to prove that you had a set of expectations in place and that you have fulfilled these as requested.  After meetings with your boss, consider sending them an email about what you were asked to do, to clarify. You can say something like “As a clarification, in our meeting you said that you want me to create a one page document highlighting all of our services and to share it with the team before publishing it.  I wanted to confirm that this is correct before moving forward.” Know that you have a right to express your boundaries in the workplace. This means making it clear in a polite but forthright manner when things are not appropriate in your interactions together. For example, if your moody boss is working up to a screeching match about some work you've done, instead of screeching back, simply say firmly that you will return to discuss the work when the two of you have had a chance to calm down and think about it a little more.  Or, if you feel constrained to sit there, be calm and confident and when the tirade ends, simply say \\"Thank you for your observations. I will consider them all in detail and provide you with a written response.\\" Use evidence and logic when your moody boss veers off into blanket allegations or rants. Avoid accusations, allegations, and ultimatums yourself. These upset any person, moody or not, and even if your boss is using these tactics, don't copy. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article suggests various strategies to handle a moody boss before considering reporting their behavior to upper management. Firstly, it recommends having a conversation with the boss to understand any underlying issues causing their behavior and seeking possible improvements. It emphasizes maintaining emotional control, keeping detailed records of tasks and expectations to disprove false accusations, and setting clear boundaries in workplace interactions. Additionally, it advises using evidence and logic while avoiding accusations, allegations, and ultimatums as they only upset the situation further.

He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term, meme. With his book The Extended Phenotype (1982), he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment. Dawkins is a prominent critic of creationism, a religious belief that humanity, life, and the universe were created by a deity without recourse to evolution. He has described the Young Earth creationist view that the Earth is only a few thousand years old as \\"a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood\\"; and his 1986 book, The Blind Watchmaker, contains a sustained critique of the argument from design, an important creationist argument. In the book, Dawkins argues against the watchmaker analogy made famous by the eighteenth-century English theologian William Paley via his book Natural Theology, in which Paley argues that just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things--with their far greater complexity--be purposefully designed. Dawkins shares the view generally held by scientists that natural selection is sufficient to explain the apparent functionality and non-random complexity of the biological world, and can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, albeit as an automatic, unguided by any designer, nonintelligent, blind watchmaker.  In 1986, Dawkins and biologist John Maynard Smith participated in an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because \\"what they seek is the oxygen of respectability\\", and doing so would \\"give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all\\". He suggests that creationists \\"don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public.\\" In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that \\"among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know.\\" When Moyers questioned him on the use of the word theory, Dawkins stated that \\"evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening.\\" He added that \\"it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English.\\"  Dawkins has opposed the inclusion of intelligent design in science education, describing it as \\"not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one\\". He has been referred to in the media as \\"Darwin's Rottweiler\\", a reference to English biologist T. H. Huxley, who was known as \\"Darwin's Bulldog\\" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's evolutionary ideas. (The contrasting sobriquet of \\"God's Rottweiler\\" was given to Pope Benedict XVI while he was a cardinal working for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.) He has been a strong critic of the British organisation Truth in Science, which promotes the teaching of creationism in state schools, and whose work Dawkins has described as an \\"educational scandal\\". He plans to subsidise schools through the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science with the delivery of books, DVDs, and pamphlets that counteract their work. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he write a book about creationism?","output":"Yes, Dawkins wrote a book about creationism. In his 1986 book, The Blind Watchmaker, he offers a sustained critique of the argument from design, which is an important creationist argument."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Question: \\"What new fire technology astonished Marco Polo when he reached the capital of China?\\" Response: \\"Capturing fire\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

Premise: \\"She was either terribly ignorant about economic affairs or terribly foresighted.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"We thought it was better for her to be terribly foresighted than ignorant.\\"?","output":"From the given premise (\\"She was either terribly ignorant about economic affairs or terribly foresighted.\\"), we can deduce a scenario in which a woman has one of two distinct qualities with respect to her understanding of economic affairs. On the one hand, if she is deemed to be terribly ignorant, she would likely possess a limited and potentially flawed understanding of economic concepts, trends, and how they affect overall economic well-being. Conversely, if she is considered terribly foresighted, she most likely has an advanced grasp of economic matters, one that enables her to make accurate predictions and understand the dynamics of the economic machinery, often long before others do. Now, let's address the hypothesis \\"We thought it was better for her to be terribly foresighted than ignorant.\\" This statement indicates that, given the premise, a group of people holds the belief that it would be more advantageous for the woman in question to possess the attribute of being terribly foresighted rather than being terribly ignorant. The thought process behind this hypothesis may be grounded in the potential benefits that foresight brings in economic matters, such as the ability to anticipate changes and adapt accordingly and the capacity to make informed decisions that promote financial success and stability. In order to examine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must first clarify what it means for a statement to \\"entail\\" another statement. In the context of logical arguments, the term \\"entailment\\" refers to the relationship between two statements in which the truth of one statement (the premise) guarantees the truth of the other (the conclusion). If the premise is true and logically entails the hypothesis, then the hypothesis must also be true. Conversely, if the premise is true but does not logically entail the hypothesis, then the hypothesis might still be false under some circumstances. In our case, the premise informs us of two possible states regarding the woman's knowledge of economic affairs, while the hypothesis is concerned with the preference of a group of people. Although the premise establishes the existence of two distinct qualities she might possess, it does not make any explicit claim about which quality is preferred or better from any particular perspective. The original premise is simply presenting a dichotomy of either ignorance or foresight, without any inherent value or preference attached to either of these qualities. It is important to note that the hypothesis might still be true even if the premise does not entail it. In other words, in a given situation, people might indeed find it better for her to be terribly foresighted than ignorant. However, this preference is not implied or guaranteed by the premise. Therefore, even if the premise is true, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow; the two statements are logically independent. In summary, the truth of the premise \\"She was either terribly ignorant about economic affairs or terribly foresighted\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"We thought it was better for her to be terribly foresighted than ignorant.\\" Although the premise lays the foundation for a possible scenario involving the woman's level of understanding about economic matters, it does not inherently guarantee or imply the preference expressed in the hypothesis, which remains independent and will rely on additional information about the beliefs and values of the group of people involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dreyfus promptly escapes from the asylum and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed, Dreyfus enlists an army of criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \\"doomsday weapon\\" in return for his daughter's freedom. Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, dissolves the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his adviser (based on Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill the other assassins to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine.

If \\"A young Indian boy holding up two newspapers with a headline on \\"Murder\\".\\", does this mean that \\"indian boy holding a newspaper with a headline on \\"murder\\"\\"?","output":"Yes, the phrase \\"A young Indian boy holding up two newspapers with a headline on 'Murder'\\" implies that there is an Indian boy who is holding newspapers that feature the headline \\"Murder.\\" Therefore, it can be appropriately rephrased as \\"Indian boy holding a newspaper with a headline on 'Murder',\\" albeit with some slight differences in emphasis and specificity. In the first phrase, the words \\"young\\" and \\"two\\" are included. These words provide additional context and details about the situation. The word \\"young\\" emphasizes that the Indian boy is not an adult, but rather a child or teenager, which could invoke different emotions or reactions from readers, such as sympathy or concern for his well-being and exposure to such sensitive topics. Furthermore, the mention of \\"two newspapers\\" signifies that the boy is holding more than one copy, suggesting that either the story of the murder made headlines in multiple sources or that he has two copies of the same newspaper. This detail might indicate that the story about the murder is a significant or high-profile event that has captured the attention of not only the young Indian boy but also the general public. It draws focus to the impact and influence of the news media in disseminating information about such incidents. On the other hand, the rephrased statement, \\"Indian boy holding a newspaper with a headline on 'Murder',\\" is a simplification of the original description. This version neglects to mention the age of the boy and the specific number of newspapers. However, the core meaning is still conveyed: an Indian boy is holding a newspaper that features a headline about a murder. The choice between these two phrasings would depend on the context in which the statement is being used, as well as the intended focus or interpretation. The original description, \\"A young Indian boy holding up two newspapers with a headline on 'Murder,'\\" provides more specific information and may provoke a stronger emotional response, while the rephrased version, \\"Indian boy holding a newspaper with a headline on 'Murder,'\\" is more straightforward and could be suitable for a more neutral context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The...

Investors want predictable profits and will punish companies that vacillate up and down. Managers want accountable employees who they can trust to get things done. Customers want to deal with firms that they can be sure will be around next week. When things are uncertain, penalties are imposed. Valuations tumble, people get fired, customers flee. That’s why managers learn to eliminate complexity from the system and keep it simple. They strive to remain within their realm of expertise and not stray too far into the unknown. Yet to manage complexity we must do more than just ignore it. We can, of course, limit uncertainty by sticking with what we know and avoiding what we don’t. Still, uncertainty is not a bug, but a feature of any system that is exposed to the real world. Sooner or later, no matter what we do to avoid it, it’s going to catch up. So, in the end, we need to meet it head on. One way for managers to limit uncertainty is to put their faith in numbers. “You manage what you measure,” as the saying goes, so devising clear metrics and analyzing them conscientiously has long been a central part of every executive’s playbook. And you can see why. People and markets can be fickle, but 1+1 always equals 2 and 2+2 always equals four. Math also ladders up to logic, so honing your analytical skills can help with a lot more than adding up balance sheets and income statements, it can help you think and act with clarity. Yet in the early 20th century, logic was where math ran into problems. That’s when Bertrand Russell came up with his famous paradox, which can be summarized as “The barber of Seville shaves every man who does not shave himself.” It seems innocent enough, but it shook mathematics to its foundations. Here was a statement —expressed mathematically—that contradicts itself and that wasn’t supposed to be possible. In fact, this little statement was so troublesome that mathematicians feared that if it was not resolved, even our certainty that 1+1 always equals 2 would be in question. At the time, David Hilbert was the global don of mathematics and, like any good CEO, he moved quickly to set things aright and close the hole that Russell opened up. He called on the world’s mathematicians to create a formal system of axioms that would be both consistent and complete. He also wanted to prove that every mathematical problem could be solved. The task outlined in Hilbert’s program seemed straightforward enough. Clearly, mathematics should be consistent (i.e. 1+1 always equals two) and complete and self sufficient (i.e. mathematical statements can be proved mathematically.) And what good is math if it can’t solve mathematical problems? For a while, they seemed to make progress, yet, as Gottlob Frege put it, “Just as the building was completed, the foundation collapsed.” As it turned out, the mathematics industry, like so many enterprises today, was undone not by a rival, but by a couple of startups. The first mortal blow to Hilbert’s program was dealt by a 25 year old Austrian named Kurt Gödel with his incompleteness theorems, which used logic to kill logic. Essentially, he proved that any formal system could be complete or consistent, but not both. A few years later, 24 year old Alan Turing used Gödel’s methods to prove that all numbers are not computable. The “Gödel debacle” shook the mathematics community to its knees. Much like the hyenas of disruption today, the two upstarts showed that everything that mathematicians had believed was fundamental to their enterprise was, in fact, just a comforting illusion. Hilbert and his band of mathematical demi-gods could hardly have imagined a greater calamity. Yet it turned out not to be so bad. In fact, Turing’s paper on the computability of numbers described a universal computer which led directly to modern digital computers. These, as we all know, have a tendency to crash, just like any logical system, but not so often that we worry too much about it. When it happens, we figure out a way to deal with it somehow. So it is true that the two young startups destroyed the world as we knew it, but they created another one far richer and with greater possibilities. We now live in the world of the visceral abstract, where seemingly ludicrous ideas like those of Gödel and Turing—and many others as well—form the basis of our daily lives and the modern economy. Much like the mathematicians of a century ago, every executive in business today must confront an industry that is being disrupted. As much as we would like to seek certainly, it is little more than a comfortable fiction. True leaders don’t avoid uncertainty, but take it upon themselves in order to provide stability for those around them. Being in a position of responsibility means that you have to make decisions, without all the facts, in a rapidly changing context. You do so in the full knowledge that if you are wrong, you will bear the blame and no one else. You can never be certain of what your decision will bring, only that it is you who has to make it. While many see the digital economy as an opportunity to take refuge in metrics, the truth is that our numbers are always wrong. Sometimes they’re off by a little, sometimes by a lot, but they are always wrong. The answer is not to try harder to get them right—they’ll still be wrong—but to become less wrong over time. We need to take a more Bayesian approach. Yet most of all, we need managerial maturity. Lacking certainty doesn’t mean to lack confidence. As the Godel debacle showed, a system can be disrupted to its very foundations and not only survive, but improve. True leaders are the ones who make that happen. Greg Satell is a US based business consultant. You can find his blog at DigitalTonto.com and follow him on Twitter @DigitalTonto What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"In the business world, certainty is highly valued by investors, managers, and customers. However, uncertainty is not something that can be entirely avoided, as it is inherent in any system exposed to the real world. Managers and executives should not shy away from uncertainty but instead, confront it head-on.  One of the ways managers attempt to control uncertainty is by relying on numbers and metrics. However, as proven by mathematicians Gödel and Turing, numbers and any logical system can be consistent or complete, but not both. This means that numbers will always be wrong to some extent, which calls for a more Bayesian approach to decision-making: making decisions with incomplete information and updating them as more data becomes available.  In today's constantly evolving digital economy, managerial maturity is crucial. True leaders embrace uncertainty and strive to provide stability for their team despite the volatile circumstances. The ability to make decisions without the guarantee of their success or full information is the essence of effective leadership. Confronting uncertainty, learning, and adapting is what allows businesses to survive and thrive in an ever-changing world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Review: American playwright Howard W. Campbell, Jr. (played with a musty obsolescence by Nick Nolte) lives happily in Germany with his actress wife, Helga Noth (Sheryl Lee) before the beginning of World War II. At the peak of his life, Howard is drafted by an American agent (John Goodman) to become a spy on behalf of the Allies; forewarned of the risks the job holds, Howard has everything to lose, but finds the offer irresistible. Following the death of his wife and the end of the war, Campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in New York City, which muddies his neuroses even further. The central question (indeed, a question that has frustrated many critics) of the movie and Kurt Vonnegut's source novel is, \\"is Campbell a hero or a traitor?\\" Director Keith Gordon and screenwriter Robert B. Weide offer us clues, but no answer, and this ambiguitythis NOT knowingis what keeps \\"Mother Night\\" fresh and interesting throughout. At the beginning of the film, Nolte portrays Campbell as intelligent and confident; by the end, he's either scared and uncertain, or scared and COMPLETELY certain of his contribution/debt to humanity for the role he played in the war. Gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the film's first half, which complement his portrait of the Nazi bourgeoisie and captures Vonnegut's dramatic side. On the flip side, when Campbell is confined to his lonely New York apartment (which he affectionately calls \\"purgatory\\") only to be discovered by a group of Nazis, the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author, and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds. The moral (even spiritual) paradox \\"Mother Night\\" presents doesn't lend itself to simple resolution, and to a degree, should be left ambiguousthe black-and-white scenes of Campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in Israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy toas Campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about; the war changes him, coming back to America changes him, and meeting up with the Nazis in New York compels him to prolong the facade of his \\"act\\" even further, to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall, spewing anti-Semitic bile. Perhaps that's the best reaction we could hope for. What is the sentiment of this review? OPTIONS: *negative. *positive.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be seen as positive.

Article: China Daily Oct. 11----The ministry of Health has called for more awareness from the public on the mental health of the young, as part of efforts to make World Mental Health Day which fell on Friday. More than 15 percent of Chinese youths have been found with mental problems, and about 30 million young people under 17 are suffering from depression, the Shang-based Wenhui Daily reported. The World Health Organization estimates that before 2020, the rate of children with mental problems will increase to 50 percent, and mental problems will become a major factor behind deaths and illness in the young worldwide. Deng  Xiaohong, the spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, said rapid changes are one of the reasons behind the rising number of youngsters with psychological problems. If these mental diseases are not addressed on time, occurrence of crimes, drug-taking and other dangerous behavior are expected to rise. Experts said mental diseases could be caused by many factors, such as the inability to handle interpersonal relations well, unstable emotions and pressures from an overload of studies. A number of experts have also said the one-child policy is another reason leading to poor mental health in the young. Children are said to be too \\" spoiled\\" and \\"selfish\\" in a one-child family. It's reported  schools in many cities are rolling out measures to help students maintain their mental well-being. Yin Jingmiao, a teacher of the Beijing No.105 Middle School, told China Daily that the school invites psychologists to provide counseling to students three times a month.\\"  Students can be arranged to have 40-minute counseling sessions,\\" Yin said. The school also gives lectures on mental health to senior grade students before they take the national college entrance exams to help ease any anxiety arising from the tests.

However, it does provide some context on the history and development of Paris' water supply and waste disposal system. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the original question would be: The city of Paris maintains a complex underground sewage and waste disposal system consisting of more than 2,400 kilometers (1,491 miles) of underground passageways. These passageways are dedicated to the transportation and evacuation of waste liquids, both from residential areas and commercial establishments. The network is continuously maintained and expanded as needed to serve the city's growing population. The Parisian sewer system traces its history back to the Middle Ages and has undergone multiple iterations and improvements over the centuries. The current extensive network of underground passageways was primarily developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the rapid urbanization and population growth of Paris. Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, who served as the Prefect of the Seine during the reign of Napoleon III, was responsible for many of the significant changes and modernizations of the sewer system. The underground sewers are a critical part of the city's infrastructure, as they play a vital role in maintaining public hygiene, preventing water pollution, and managing flood risks. In addition to the sewage removal system, Paris also has separate stormwater drainage networks to manage heavy rainfall and keep floodwaters away from the streets. As the city continues to grow and evolve, the underground passageways and infrastructure will play a vital role in safeguarding the health and safety of the residents as well as protecting the environment. The municipal government continues to invest in upgrading and improving the sewer systems to meet modern demands and challenges."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What's more, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with The Rock versus Austin and The Rock prevailing for his team. And don't get me started on the preview before the event. No matter who won it was obvious that no one was going to f***ing die. There was no need for all of that pointless hype. Whatever the storyline, it was just a wrestling event. And as for the rest of the matches: the first match was Christian defending his European title against Al Snow. It was a good fast paced match and its good to see a heel winning a match fairly. William Regal versus Tajiri was boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before. Edge versus Test was good but nothing great. The tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening. The battle Royal went on for 10 minutes and no one really cared who'd win in the first place. The Women's title match wasn't great. No, not in the slightest. The main event must have been the most hypocritical match in history. The Alliance lost but guess what, after 5 months every single Alliance superstar returned. The match itself was poor.

News article: Rogers in Question, Springs Probable Washington Redskins starting cornerbacks Carlos Rogers and Shawn Springs were the focus of yesterday's last injury report before tomorrow's showdown with the Dallas Cowboys at FedEx Field, and for Coach Joe Gibbs, the news was something of a split decision. Rogers, the former first-round draft pick who started at left corner the past two games but is nursing a bruised left biceps muscle, was downgraded from probable to questionable. He began the week wearing a sling and did not practice this week. \\"It's very painful. He can't straighten his arm out,\\" Redskins Director of Sports Medicine Bubba Tyer said of Rogers. \\"There's a lot of time between now and Sunday and maybe something happens and he makes a great recovery. But we're just now getting to a point where we can work him a little bit. It's still touch and go at this point.\\" Springs, who saw his back tighten in Arizona and injured his left groin, was listed as probable for the entire week, even though he only practiced yesterday, meaning playing is a virtual certainty. Springs did not practice Wednesday and Thursday, but said he would be on the field tomorrow. \\"I'll be ready. I know Keyshawn will be ready. I know T-Glenn will be ready,\\" Springs said, referring to the Dallas wide receiver tandem of Keyshawn Johnson and Terry Glenn. \\"Terry was my college teammate [at Ohio State]. He's the reason I went so high in the draft, he helped me so much. I know Sunday, I'll be ready to ride onto the field. This is it. Big game Sunday.\\" Walt Harris, who started nine games before being replaced by Rogers in the first half of the San Diego game, is slowed by a calf injury that forced him to miss the Arizona game. Harris did not travel with the team last week and, like Springs, only practiced once this week. \\"By Sunday, I'll be good. I'll be fine,\\" Harris said. \\"This is the whole season, so I'll be ready.\\" In addition to Rogers, starting weak-side linebacker LaVar Arrington was downgraded to questionable, meaning he has a 50-50 chance of playing. Arrington has been hobbled by a right quadriceps injury suffered against Oakland but re-aggravated in St. Louis. The thigh injury is both curious and frustrating for Arrington, because it appears to be a variation of the injury that sidelined him for much of last season, and because after the injury recurred in the first half of the 24-9 victory over St. Louis, Arrington returned to action. But he did not play Sunday against Arizona and, having suffered a setback, did not finish practice Wednesday and didn't practice at all Thursday and yesterday. \\"He's been around a long time. This is a big game for him,\\" Gibbs said. \\"All I can say now is we'll have to see.\\" Where Springs was in positive spirits, Arrington has not talked about his condition since Monday, an apparent sign that he is not comfortable with his level of recovery. It was a contrast as well from the mood of defensive tackle Joe Salave'a, who has missed the last two games because of plantar fasciitis in his left foot but said he will play. \\"All I need is for the coaches to let me go,\\" Salave'a said. \\"It feels much better than when I first injured it against Kansas City. I couldn't put any weight on it, couldn't even walk. But I feel ready to go now. Now's the time where the injuries are going to have to wait until March.\\" The Redskins have not played down the importance of tomorrow's game. If anything, the players seem to recognize that the injury factor could be the difference. Gibbs also said that backup safety Matt Bowen had been downgraded to questionable. Bowen is suffering with a ruptured bursa sac on the knee, and seemed to have a setback in practice Thursday. Bowen did not practice yesterday. Offensively, left tackle Chris Samuels did not practice except for walkthroughs yesterday and Gibbs said he did fine. Samuels injured his right ankle and knee in Arizona and did not practice during the week. \\"I feel good. Ready to go,\\" Samuels said. \\"All I can tell you is that I'll be out there. For how many plays, how long and all that, I really don't know. But I'll be playing.\\" Gibbs said James Thrash had done more work and could be ready. The return of Thrash would be felt on special teams, but especially offensively, where the Redskins have been depleted at wide receiver. Thrash hasn't played since Nov. 20 against the Raiders and the combination of Taylor Jacobs, Antonio Brown and Jimmy Farris has combined for seven catches in the three games, four of which came from Jacobs on Nov. 27 against San Diego. The result has been defenses focusing heavily on top wide receiver Santana Moss and H-Back Chris Cooley without much fear of quarterback Mark Brunell throwing to other options. Still, Gibbs did not appear to be overly optimistic. \\"With James, we're going to have to see,\\" Gibbs said.

Washington Redskins starting cornerbacks Carlos Rogers and Shawn Springs are dealing with injuries ahead of the game against the Dallas Cowboys at FedEx Field. 2.

Question: Information:  - Advocacy is an activity by an individual or group which aims to influence decisions within political, economic, and social systems and institutions. Advocacy can include many activities that a person or organization undertakes including media campaigns, public speaking, commissioning and publishing research or conducting exit poll or the filing of an amicus brief. Lobbying (often by lobby groups) is a form of advocacy where a direct approach is made to legislators on an issue which plays a significant role in modern politics. Research has started to address how advocacy groups in the United States and Canada are using social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action.  - A barrister (also known as barrister-at-law or bar-at-law) is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions who works at higher levels of court. Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation. Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Often, barristers are also recognised as \\"legal scholars\\".  - A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.  - Richard Pepper Arden , 1st Baron Alvanley PC KC ( 20 May 1744 -- 19 March 1804 ) was a British barrister and Whig politician , who served as the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas . He was a Member of Parliament from 1783 to 1801 .  - Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by judges, courts, and similar tribunals, stated in decisions that nominally decide individual cases but that in addition have precedential effect on future cases. Common law is a third branch of law, in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as \\"stare decisis\\"). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \\"matter of first impression\\"), judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision). Resolution of the issue in one case becomes precedent that binds future courts. \\"Stare decisis\\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.  - A tribunal, generally, is any person or institution with authority to judge, adjudicate on, or determine claims or disputeswhether or not it is called a tribunal in its title. For example, an advocate who appears before a court with a single judge could describe that judge as 'their tribunal'. Many governmental bodies that are titled 'tribunals' are so described to emphasize that they are not courts of normal jurisdiction. For example, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is a body specially constituted under international law; in Great Britain, employment tribunals are bodies set up to hear specific employment disputes. Private judicial bodies are also often styled 'tribunals'. The word \\"tribunal\\" is not conclusive of a body's function. For example, in Great Britain, the Employment Appeal Tribunal is a superior court of record.    What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'richard arden'?

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   User:DrU/Wikipedia. Strawberry plants have horizontal stems called stolons that can form new plants. . Public Domain.   Q: The horizontal stems on strawberry plants are called what?   A: The answer is:","output":"The horizontal stems on strawberry plants are called stolons. In the given paragraph from DrU/Wikipedia, it is mentioned that strawberry plants possess these particular structures known as stolons, which have the ability to form new plants. Stolons, also referred to as runners, are important for the propagation and growth of strawberry plants as they help the plant spread vegetatively, creating new individual plants that are genetically identical to the parent plant. These stolons grow outwards from the main plant and develop roots at specific nodes or points along their length. Once these roots are established in the soil, a new plant or daughter plant emerges from the node, forming a separate, independent strawberry plant. Over time, this process of producing stolons with new plantlets allows the strawberry plant to both expand its area of growth and ensure the survival and continuation of its genetic lineage. In addition to ensuring the reproduction and survival of the plant, stolons also aid in the plant's ability to compete for resources, like sunlight, nutrients, and water, as they extend outward and establish new individual plants. This spreading growth pattern is one of the reasons why strawberry plants are known for their prolific nature and ability to colonize new environments efficiently. In summary, the horizontal stems on strawberry plants are called stolons, which play a vital role in forming new plants, propagating the species, competing for resources, and allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her. My trousers were torn, and my ankles, legs, and hands were bleeding. I told her that I would not be back, and left. Later that night, her husband called to apologize on her behalf. I told him that I appreciated the call, but he wasn’t the one who needed to apologize. Peace Why was the writer attacked?  A. not enough information  B. Because the writer antagonized the dogs.  C.

You are expected to classify the post into two classes: sarcastic or non-sarcastic. A sarcastic sentence is one that refers to the use of words that mean the opposite of what you really want to say, especially in order to insult someone, or to show irritation, or just to be funny.

Usage: \\"First day I didn't speak to you at all and it feels so weird 😫\\" This is a tweet in English, as it uses English words and phrases to convey a feeling. Part #2: Identifying sarcasm. Usage: A sarcastic sentence would involve words that mean the opposite of what the speaker wants to say, often used for humor or expressing irritation. For example, \\"I just love getting stuck in traffic.\\" Here, the speaker is expressing frustration by using \\"love\\" to show that they actually dislike getting stuck in traffic. Part #3: Classifying the tweet into sarcastic or non-sarcastic. Usage: For the tweet \\"First day I didn't speak to you at all and it feels so weird 😫\\", the classification would be non-sarcastic. This is because the statement does not contain words that mean the opposite of what the speaker wants to say. The tweet expresses genuine emotion regarding not speaking to someone and feeling weird about it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Input: Paris, France (CNN) -- Hundreds of French workers, angry about proposed layoffs at a Caterpillar factory, were holding executives of the company hostage Tuesday, a spokesman for the workers said. Caterpillar's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs. It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said.

He is the son of Dale (nee Lewis), a high school admissions counselor, and Pete Wentz II, an attorney. He is of English and German descent on his father's side and Afro-Jamaican on his mother's side. He has a younger sister, Hillary, and a younger brother, Andrew. Wentz has bipolar disorder, and has taken medication for it since he was eighteen. In February 2005, Wentz attempted suicide by taking an overdose of the anxiety medication Ativan, and as a result, spent a week in the hospital. Commenting on the event to a magazine, he said:  The suicide attempt was put into song form, \\"7 Minutes in Heaven (Atavan Halen)\\" and released on their album, From Under The Cork Tree. After this event, Wentz moved back in with his parents. Wentz later spoke of his suicide attempt to the support site Halfofus.com and cites Jeff Buckley's version of the Leonard Cohen classic \\"Hallelujah\\" as a song that saved his life.  In 2006, Wentz started dating singer Ashlee Simpson. In April 2008, Simpson and Wentz confirmed their engagement, and were married on May 17, 2008, at Simpson's parents' residence in Encino, California, with her father officiating the ceremony. Two weeks later, she confirmed her pregnancy. Her surname changed from Simpson to Wentz and she was briefly known professionally as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. Simpson gave birth to their son on November 20, 2008.  On February 8, 2011, Simpson filed for divorce, citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\". She asked for joint custody and primary physical custody of their son with visitation for Wentz, along with spousal support. However, a later report said that Simpson believed the couple simply \\"married too young\\", with the source stating that, \\"It was honestly a classic case of marrying young, having a kid young and growing apart over the years\\". Wentz reportedly did not want the divorce. Their divorce was finalized on November 22, 2011.  On February 17, 2014, Wentz and his current girlfriend Meagan Camper announced that the couple were expecting their first child together and Wentz's second. Their son was born on August 21, 2014.

Attempts are frequently made to regulate emotion according to the conventions of the society and the situation based on many (sometimes conflicting) demands and expectations which originate from various entities. The emotion of anger is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women, while fear is discouraged in boys and men. Expectations attached to social roles, such as \\"acting as man\\" and not as a woman, and the accompanying \\"feeling rules\\" contribute to the differences in expression of certain emotions. Some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures. Some social institutions are seen as based on certain emotion, such as love in the case of contemporary institution of marriage. In advertising, such as health campaigns and political messages, emotional appeals are commonly found. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism.

Article: Speaking in public is most people's least favorite thing. The reason is that we're all afraid of making fools of ourselves. The more important the speech is the more frightened we become.     But stop biting  your finger-nails. Public speaking is easy. It's just plain talking, and you talk all the time. Public speaking is not a \\"gift\\" like musical talent or being able to draw. Anybody who can talk can speak in public. Here are some tips:     Keep it simple. Your audience is going to learn one or two from your main ideas by heart.  If you can't express, then your speech is not focused well enough. And if you don't have a clear idea of what you want to say, then your audience will have no interest in your speech.      Get organized. No matter how long or short your speech is, you'd better get your materials in order: how you're going to start, what major points you want to make and how you're going to close. You may often write the last sentence first. When you know what your aim is, you can choose any ways to get there. A strong close is powerful. The last thing you say is what your audience will most likely remember.      Keep it short. The standard length of a vaudeville act was 12 minutes. If all those troupers want to sing and dance, they may make the audience bored. So make your speech short. Question: What does the author teach us here? - Not to make fools of ourselves. - How to make a speech. - To talk all the time. - How to have a clear idea when you speak.

Available choices: [a]. the writer; [b]. not enough information; [c]. the reader; [d]. the commenter; Q: Every so often I see a scenario play out that I find rather disappointing. It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“. This is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.

Health officials issued a waring over common energy-saving lghtbulbs  after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer. A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV)   radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light. The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn. The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes. People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out. It has confirmed that the government will not be reviewing its strategy on introducing energy efficient lightbulbs. In order not to be harmed by the UV radiation from some lightbulbs, people should   _  . A) stop using eco-friendly lightbulbs at home B) avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work C) take care not to expose their skin to direct sunlight D) urge the government to ban the use of lightbulbs A:","output":"Health officials have issued a warning regarding the potential health risks associated with certain energy-saving lightbulbs, as research conducted by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) indicates that some types of these bulbs might emit levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation above recognized safety limits. This could lead to potential harm to the skin, including an increased risk of skin cancer. The warning is primarily directed at individuals who work in close proximity to lamps, such as those who use desk lamps for extended periods, like jewelry makers and car mechanics. People with lupus, a skin condition that heightens sensitivity to light, have also raised concerns about this issue. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's center for radiation, chemical, and environmental hazards, led tests on these energy-saving lightbulbs. The results showed that the highest measured UV radiation levels at 2cm away from the bulbs were similar to being outside in direct sunlight during the summer months. Immediate risks associated with the lightbulbs include skin reddening akin to sunburn, as well as a slightly increased risk of skin cancer, which is also comparable to the risks posed by sunburn. Despite these findings, the potential health risks associated with the lightbulbs are not so significant that people should remove them from their homes entirely. Instead, individuals should avoid using open lightbulbs for lengthy, close-up work until the issue is addressed further. Consequently, the answer to the question is B) avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work. It should be noted that the government has no plans to review its strategy concerning the introduction of energy-efficient lightbulbs, which highlights that the risks, while worth considering and taking precautions against, are not severe enough to warrant a large-scale policy change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Capacitor: Capacitors, especially ceramic capacitors, and older designs such as paper capacitors, can absorb sound waves resulting in a microphonic effect. Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing AC current. Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate audible sound, but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any. What is it called when a changing electric field existing between the conductive plates of a capacitor physically moves them?","output":"When a changing electric field existing between the conductive plates of a capacitor physically moves them, it is referred to as the \\"reverse microphonic effect.\\" This phenomenon occurs when the varying electric field exerts a physical force on the plates, causing them to move in a manner similar to a speaker.

A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. Question: How long have the friends' been seated before the cigarette disaster occurred?

Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States of different regions traded among themselves in the Pre-Columbian Era, but Europeans participated in the trade beginning from the time of their arrival in the New World and extended its reach to Europe. The French started trading in the 16th century, the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada in the 17th century, and the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland. The 19th-century North American fur trade, when the industry was at its peak of economic importance, involved the development of elaborate trade networks. Deerskin trade was at its most profitable in the mid-18th century. The Creeks rose up as the largest deerskin supplier, and the increase in supply only intensified European demand for deerskins. Native Americans continued to negotiate the most lucrative trade deals by forcing England, France, and Spain to compete for their supply of deerskins. In the 1750s and 1760s, the Seven Years' War disrupted France's ability to provide manufactures goods to its allies, the Choctaws and Chickasaw. The French and Indian War further disrupted trade, as the British blockaded French goods. The Cherokees allied themselves with France, who were driven out from the southeast in accordance with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The British were now the dominant trading power in the southeast.  While both the Cherokee and the Creek were the main trading partners of the British, their relationships with the British were different. The Creeks adapted to the new economic trade system, and managed to hold onto their old social structures. Originally Cherokee land was divided into five districts; however, the number soon grew to thirteen districts with 200 hunters assigned per district due to deerskin demand.  Charleston and Savannah were the main trading ports for the export of deerskins. Deerskins became the most popular export, and monetarily supported the colonies with the revenue produced by taxes on deerskins. Charleston's trade was regulated by the Indian Trade Commission, composed of traders who monopolized the market and profited off the sale of deerskins. From the beginning of the 18th century to mid-century, the deerskin exports of Charleston more than doubled in exports. Charleston received tobacco and sugar from the West Indies and rum from the North in exchange for deerskins. In return for deerskins, Great Britain sent woolens, guns, ammunition, iron tools, clothing, and other manufactured goods that were traded to the Native Americans. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What was different between them?","output":"The differences between the Creeks and Cherokees in relation to the British were as follows: \\"The Creeks adapted to the new economic trade system, and managed to hold onto their old social structures.

Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.Federal agents obtained a warrant to search the house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned that he was being hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked.

Every lattice point in a pure metallic element is occupied by an atom of the same metal. The packing efficiency in metallic crystals tends to be high, so the resulting metallic solids are dense, with each atom having as many as 12 nearest neighbors. Bonding in metallic solids is quite different from the bonding in the other kinds of solids we have discussed. Because all the atoms are the same, there can be no ionic bonding, yet metals always contain too few electrons or valence orbitals to form covalent bonds with each of their neighbors. Instead, the valence electrons are delocalized throughout the crystal, providing a strong cohesive force that holds the metal atoms together.

Unfortunately, our experience was far from being satisfactory. The poor service and lack of quality in the food left us utterly disappointed. We arrived at the restaurant around 8 pm on a busy Saturday night. To be fair, the décor and ambiance of the place looked inviting and we eagerly looked forward to our meal. However, it all went downhill from the moment we sat down.  I mentioned my dietary restrictions, as I am allergic to gluten, to our server, who appeared rather uninterested and aloof. Despite my clear request, they brought an appetizer with gluten and seemed bothered when I pointed this out and asked for a gluten-free option. After waiting for a while, the dish was finally replaced, but the server didn't even apologize for the confusion. Our main courses arrived at the table about 40 minutes after we ordered, which is way too long, considering the place was not that crowded. My partner's dish, a pasta dish, was overcooked and the sauce tasted bland, nothing like the fresh and flavorful description boasted on their menu. My entrée, a seafood dish, was lukewarm and had a suspicious smell to it, making me question its freshness. We contemplated sending the dishes back but decided against it, given the indifference our server had already shown. Throughout the evening, the overall service was painfully slow. Our water glasses were empty for extended periods, and no one bothered to refill them or ask if we wanted another drink. It seemed as if the entire staff was preoccupied with other matters, leaving the diners wholly unattended. When the time came to ask for the check, we had to flag down our server, who yet again seemed bothered by our request, as if we were bothering them while they were on a break.

A grave of a man dating back to around 2300 BC was found by archaeologists in England On May 3, 2002. Buried with him were the tools of a hunter or warrior. There was a bone pin that may have been from a piece of clothing such as a leather coat. He carried a copper knife on his breast. The most amazing find was two gold earrings. That would have made him a man of distinction. Only a few centimeters from his head were two pots made of clay, tools and materials to make arrows, a bow and a dozen arrows for hunting and a second, smaller copper knife. Next to them lay a cushion stone, upon which the man could work metal. His grave is the richest of any found from that period, because this man was buried with two gold earrings which are the oldest gold ever found in Britain (dated to 2470 BC). Besides, he was buried three miles from Stonehenge. Archaeologists tend to believe he was a member of a powerful class who might have organized the construction of Stonehenge. Stonehenge was begun around 3000 BC. In about 2300 BC the huge stone circles were built. The biggest stone weighed approximately 20 tons. But the smaller blue stones, still weighing 4 tons on average, came from west Wales. It is not yet known how these were conveyed over a distance of 380 km. It is also a mystery how early man was able to construct Stonehenge without the use of modern construction machines and lorries.

They are usually a white dwarf with a companion late sequence red giant. They are indicated by the exhibition of spectral lines of the highly contrasting temperatures of the red giant (~3000 K) and the white dwarf (~20 000 K). The white dwarf gains mass from stellar wind from the red giant or gravitational streaming.  - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then:  - A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name \\"white dwarf\\" was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922. The universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take many billions of years.  - Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. This is a subjective attribute/property of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of color appearance models. Brightness refers to an absolute term and should not be confused with Lightness.  - A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass (roughly 0.38 solar masses) in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature as low as 5,000 K and lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red, including the spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars.  - A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter. Systems of two or more stars are called \\"multiple star systems\\". These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means. Research over the last two centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - A stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star.

Red velvet cake has a mild chocolate flavor and a moist, tender crumb. The distinguishing taste of red velvet comes from a mix of buttermilk, vinegar, and cocoa powder. In addition, it is often paired with a rich and tangy cream cheese frosting, which complements the delicate flavors of the cake. Step-by-step justification:  - Mention the mild chocolate flavor as a base characteristic. - Include the unique ingredients that contribute to the specific taste of red velvet cake (buttermilk, vinegar, cocoa powder). - Note the common frosting paired with red velvet cake and its impact on the overall taste. 2. Why do some people hate to eat chicken? Some people may dislike eating chicken for various reasons, such as taste, texture, or ethical concerns.

Here's a general step by step guide to create a simple wooden trash bin: Materials and Tools Needed: 1. Wooden planks: From plywood or hardwood of choice such as cedar, pine, cherry, or oak. 2. Screws and Wood Glue: For securing the wooden planks. 3. Saw: For cutting the wood. You can use a hand saw or a circular saw. 4. Sandpaper: Fine grit to smooth the wood out. 5. Drill: For making holes to screw the wood pieces. 6. Paint or Varnish: For finishing and protecting the wood. 7. Tape Measure: For measuring the wood accurately. 8. Square: To ensure right angles when assembling your trash bin. 9. Safety Gear: Include gloves, safety goggles, and dust mask. Steps: 1. Design Your Trash Bin: Draw a simple blueprint of your bin which should include measurements of all sides - front, back, sides, bottom, and if you want, a lid. For a typical kitchen trash bin, a size of around 25” height x 15” width x 15” depth could be appropriate. 2. Cut Your Wood: Measure and mark the measurements on your wooden planks according to your blueprint using the tape measure. Then cut them to the appropriate size using your saw. 3. Smooth Your Wood: Use your sandpaper to smooth out all the pieces of wood, removing any splinters or rough edges and make them even and ready for assembly. 4. Assemble Your Trash Bin: Start by attaching together two sides and the bottom. Apply wood glue where the wood pieces will join and then screw them together for extra strength. Use your square to make sure you’re attaching the pieces at right angles. Repeat this process to attach all the sides. 5. Create a Lid (Optional): If you want a lid, you can build a simple flat piece that fits the top of the bin or something more complex like a flip-top lid. Create it in the same way as you built the rest of the bin. 6. Final Smoothing: After assembly, use your sandpaper again to smooth the joined edges and corners. 7. Painting or Varnishing: Apply a coat of paint or varnish to give it a nice finish and protect the wood. Let it dry according to the product's instructions before using your trash bin. Remember to always use your safety equipment to protect yourself from splinters, sawdust and other potential hazards during this project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I decided to use conditioner instead of shampoo on my hair, the","output":"results were surprising. My usual morning routine was never quite as exciting as this. As I massage the conditioner into my scalp, I notice that the texture of my hair is different. It feels smoother, silkier than it ever had before. Intrigued, I decide to spend an extra few minutes in the shower just to let the conditioner do its job. Although I'm curious about how my hair will look and feel once dry, I take my time finishing up my morning routine. By the time I step out of the shower, I can hardly believe the transformation. The feeling of clean freshness that usually accompanies shampooing my hair is replaced with a newfound sense of softness and hydration. As I run a comb through my hair, I can't help but notice how easily it glides, almost as if the tangles evaporated with the steam from the shower. Drying my hair is a different experience as well. Ordinarily, I would use a towel to aggressively rub the strands dry, which often leads to more tangles and frizz. Acting on a hunch, I instead gently squeeze out the excess water and pat it dry with an old T-shirt, a technique that has done wonders for curly-haired friends. It's shocking how quickly my hair absorbs the water, a testament to the nourishing prowess of the conditioner. As my hair dries, I realize that the usual dull, flat locks that stared back at me in the mirror are replaced with a healthy, vibrant shine – as if my hair had been reborn after one simple change in routine. The lifeless strands of yesteryears now bounce with every move, much to the amusement of my sprightly reflection. Satisfied with the results, I decide to experiment further by forgoing the use of styling products. I spritz my hair lightly with water and scrunch it, aiming to bring out its natural texture. The conditioner seems to have activated dormant waves and curls that were hidden all along beneath the layers of harsh shampoo chemicals and synthetic styling gels. Throughout the day, a series of compliments greet me as I walk through the office corridors and attend meetings. Friends and colleagues alike are captivated by the newfound luster, kindly inquiring about the changes I've made to achieve such a striking transformation. I revel in their curiosity and gladly spread the gospel of conditioner over shampoo, realizing that I've stumbled upon a secret that's too good not to share. As the sun sets and the day draws to a close, I reflect upon the surprising turn my morning had taken. In changing one small aspect of my daily routine, I discovered a world of difference in the health and appearance of my hair. Embracing this newfound self-assurance, I vow to continue experimenting and exploring alternate ways to care for my tresses – whether through different products, routines, or techniques. After all, who knew that a simple switch from shampoo to conditioner could lead to such a captivating metamorphosis? Another exciting beauty adventure awaits me just around the corner, and I eagerly anticipate the next serendipitous discovery that will forever change my outlook on personal care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are a few aspects to consider when deciding whether it's worth investing in the movie, \\"Tweety's SOS\\": 1. Target audience: The first thing to consider is whether there's a demand for this type of movie among the target audience. The film seems to be a family-friendly animated comedy focused on the characters of Tweety, Sylvester, and Granny. Fans of classic Looney Tunes cartoons might enjoy this movie due to its nostalgic appeal. However, it would be vital to ensure that this nostalgia translates into a modern-day audience, especially for younger viewers who might not be familiar with these characters. 2. Creativity and originality: The plot seems to revolve around a well-established formula – Sylvester tries to catch Tweety, faces obstacles, and ultimately fails. While these antics can be amusing, it could be challenging to sustain interest in a full-length feature film without introducing new ideas or plot twists. Is there enough variation in the storyline to keep viewers entertained throughout the movie? 3. Quality of animation and production: A significant aspect of making an animated film successful is the overall quality of the animation and production. For this film to be worth investing in, the animation must be of high quality and reflect the styles and expressions of the characters in a way that engages the audience. Additionally, the voice acting and sound design should be top-notch to enhance viewer immersion. 4. Marketing potential: To make the film a success, it would be crucial to have a solid marketing plan in place as well. Consider whether the target audience would be interested in this film – would it appeal to families and those who grew up watching Looney Tunes? Are there any opportunities for merchandising and tie-ins with other products or franchises to help drive investment return? 5. Financial projections and budget: Analyze the film's projected budget, including production costs, marketing, and distribution expenses. Compare this with potential box office earnings, video/streaming sales, and other revenue sources like merchandising. Make sure to consider the competition in the market when estimating potential earnings. 6. Distribution strategy: How will the movie be distributed? Will it have a theatrical release, or will it be released primarily on a streaming platform or through direct-to-consumer channels? Evaluate the distribution plan and how it aligns with current viewing habits and preferences to maximize its potential reach. In conclusion, consider the factors mentioned above when evaluating whether to invest in the film proposal for \\"Tweety's SOS\\". As with any investment, weigh the risks and potential returns carefully and consider consulting with professionals or conducting additional research to make an informed decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Wolf wants to redeem his father's reputation, but finds that such a feat will be harder than he thought after he encounters hostility from the villagers. Aside from his family, Wolf's only friend is the local policeman Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) who bears an artificial arm, his real arm having been \\"ripped out by the roots\\" in an encounter with the Monster as a child. While investigating his father's castle, Wolf meets Ygor (BÃ©la Lugosi), a demented blacksmith who has survived a hanging for graverobbing and has a deformed neck as a result. Wolf finds the Monster's comatose body in the crypt where his grandfather and father were buried; his father's sarcophagus bears the phrase \\"Henrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters\\" written in chalk. He decides to revive the Monster to prove his father was right, and to restore honor to his family. Wolf uses the torch to scratch out the word \\"Monsters\\" on the casket and write \\"Men\\" beside it. When the Monster (Boris Karloff) is revived, it only responds to Ygor's commands and commits a series of murders; the victims were all jurors at Ygor's trial. Wolf discovers this and confronts Ygor. Wolf shoots Ygor and apparently kills him. The Monster abducts Wolf's son as revenge, but cannot bring himself to kill the child. Krogh and Wolf pursue the Monster to the nearby laboratory, where a struggle ensues, during which the Monster tears out Krogh's false arm. Wolf swings on a rope and knocks the Monster into a molten sulphur pit under the laboratory, saving his son.

Ygor uses the Monster to exact revenge on the jurors who had sentenced him to hanging, leading to a series of murders in the village. Eventually, Wolf confronts and shoots Ygor, seemingly killing him, bringing an end to Ygor's control over the Monster and his involvement in the story."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

However, I can provide an answer based on general knowledge. In the United Kingdom, tuition fees for public universities are differentiated between domestic students and international students. Domestic students include those from the UK and usually the EU/EEA (though changes may be happening due to Brexit). International students are those coming from non-EU/EEA countries. Domestic students are typically charged a regulated fee, which is set by the government. For the 2021/2022 academic year, the maximum tuition fee for domestic undergraduate students in England is £9,250. Students from Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland may pay different fees in their home countries, and the fees may also vary if they study in other parts of the UK. International students usually pay higher tuition fees, which are set by each individual university. These fees vary depending on the university, the program of study, and the student's country of origin. Some universities may offer scholarships or financial aid to help reduce fees for international students.

Însă nu putem spune că nu am adoptat un plan european de redresare economică, iar acesta a fost punctul maxim acceptat de statele membre. Translate to English English:","output":"However, we cannot say that we have not adopted a European economic recovery plan, and this has been the maximum point accepted by the member states. The European economic recovery plan, also known as the Next Generation EU, was established to address the social and economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan's primary objective is to assist European countries in recovering from the crisis, rebuilding stronger, more resilient economies, and fostering sustainable growth while taking into consideration climate change and other long-term challenges. The recovery plan features a massive funding package of 750 billion euros, including grants and loans to support European nations that have been severely impacted by the pandemic. Part of this funding is allocated towards the Resilience and Recovery Facility (RRF), which focuses on investing in member states' economic growth, creating jobs, and addressing social inequalities. Additionally, the plan emphasizes a green and digital recovery, pursuing environmentally friendly policies and encouraging the development of digital skills and technologies. To ensure a fair and all-encompassing recovery, the funds are distributed among EU countries based on their respective needs and capacities. This helps to promote social cohesion and solidarity, while also working towards a more integrated Single Market. Moreover, the European economic recovery plan aims to strengthen the EU's budgetary capacity by instituting new resources, such as a digital tax or a carbon border adjustment mechanism. These efforts intend to provide the needed budgetary support to enhance the Union's resilience and ability to respond to future crises. Finally, the plan also features a governance framework that requires member states to present their national recovery strategies to the European Commission, ensuring that the allocated funds are used effectively and responsibly. This framework also promotes transparency and accountability and encourages regular monitoring and reporting of progress. In summary, the adoption of the European economic recovery plan demonstrates the EU's commitment to overcoming the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting its member states in their recovery efforts, and working towards a more sustainable and prosperous future for all Europeans. This plan, which is the maximum point accepted by the member states, embodies their shared values and aspirations as they collectively strive to build a stronger and more resilient European Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It highlighted duplication and called for a simpler, more efficient system. Sir Liam said the panel should be international and it should be agreed in advance to accept its proposals. However, Health Minister Simon Hamilton did not agree, saying the panel should be mostly local and there would be no upfront agreement to accept its findings. The panel announced on Thursday has two international figures and four more from Northern Ireland. It will be chaired by Prof Rafael Bengoa who is director of the health department at the Deusto Business School in Spain. He is regarded as a worldwide expert on health reform and has advised the European Union and the Obama administration. Prof Bengoa previously worked for the World Health Organisation for more than 15 years. He said that over the last 40 years, there had been a focus in health on \\"planning around structures instead of planning around patient needs and outcomes\\". \\"The important thing for us at the panel is to be thinking in outcome terms and then we see if there is any physical restructuring that is needed to fulfil those outcomes but not the other way around,\\" he added. \\"The difference Northern Ireland is suggesting is that they are engaging both politically and technically on the long-term and so other countries are not doing that and that is why I think it is interesting to accept this invitation to lead the panel.\\" Other panel members include two Northern Ireland-based doctors and two health service managers who are from Northern Ireland but now work in England.

This is to be discussed a a political summit on health next month. The experts will then begin the main part of their work by mid-March.

Now, after I've seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters (\\"The highway belongs to me...ME!\\"), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the \\"plot\\", but still you'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road. Blech. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The person who wrote this review is very unhappy and disappointed with the movie they watched. They think it is a really bad and confusing movie, and it made them feel sad and frustrated. They also didn't like some parts of the movie that had unnecessary violence and nudity.

The afterlife did a good job on the reconstruction process . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why is the narrator being so weepy in their talk ?","output":"The narrator seems to be weepy in their talk for a few reasons. First, let us break down the different elements and emotions within the passage to understand the underlying intensity of their emotions. 1. \\"You gave me the single most important thing I ever had. You gave me - the world.\\" - The narrator is expressing a feeling of immense gratitude towards someone for providing them with something of great importance. They received something so significant that it changed the course of their life, making the world a more meaningful and valuable place for them. This indicates that the narrator might be overwhelmed with appreciation and feeling indebted to the person who provided them with this invaluable gift. 2. \\"<You should not have had to wield such a burden.>\\" - The narrator also shows concern for the person who gave them this gift, realizing that it might have been a heavy responsibility or a burden for the giver. The acknowledgment of this burden indicates that the narrator is empathetic towards the person who helped them, and the possibility of sadness knowing that someone else had to bear the brunt for their sake. 3. \\"Looking around, the site still looked as it had in my dreams.\\" - This statement hints at the notion that the narrator has long-held dreams about the place they are now in, and the fact that it looks the same as it did in their dreams brings about an emotional response. This could be a combination of relief, astonishment, or nostalgia, making their emotions even more poignant. 4. \\"The afterlife did a good job on the reconstruction process.\\" - The mention of the afterlife suggests that the narrator might have experienced a major life event, leading them to a new phase or realm. This could mean the end of their life on Earth or a significant change that has shifted their entire perspective on life and what comes afterward. Knowing that they are now in a space that has been \\"reconstructed\\" to look like the place they once knew can evoke feelings of sadness, longing, or bittersweet memories. Given these reasons, it is evident that the narrator is weepy because they are overwhelmed with gratitude, feeling empathetic and concerned for their benefactor, astonished by the familiar environment, and possibly grieving over the changes that have occurred in their life. Combined, these emotions create a highly emotional atmosphere that leads the narrator to express their feelings in a weepy manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Information:  - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.  - Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868  December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect.  - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.  - George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868  February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory.  - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.  - Amos Gager Throop (; 18111894) was a businessman and politician in Chicago, Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s. Most famously he was known for being a staunch abolitionist prior to the Civil War. In Chicago he lost two campaigns to be that city's mayor in 1852 and 1854. In both elections he was the nominee of the little-known Temperance Party, facing tough opposition from the Democratic Party. At the time of the Great Chicago Fire Amos was the city treasurer. He was instrumental in securing financing from New York to rebuild the wooden frontier town into a city of brick and mortar. Grateful Chicagoans renamed Main Street to Throop Street. Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888.  - Wallace Leslie William Sargent FRS ( February 15 , 1935 -- October 29 , 2012 ) was a British - born American astronomer and the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Astronomy at California Institute of Technology .  - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.  - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.  - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students.  Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College.  - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley.  - Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866  June 3, 1936) was a U.S. chemist, inventor and educator. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: He was hiking for miles, what did he suffer from? Options: - sweating - cramps - physical exertion - smile - deliriousness  The answer is \\"cramps\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"cramps\\" because cramps are a common issue hikers face during long hikes. After hiking for miles, a hiker's muscles can become overworked and fatigued, which can lead to involuntary contractions or spasms known as cramps. These painful muscle contractions typically occur in the legs, particularly the calf muscles, but can also affect other muscle groups. There are several reasons why hikers may experience cramps during long hikes: 1. Dehydration: When the body loses fluids through sweating, the levels of electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium in the blood decrease, causing the muscles to contract painfully. 2. Overexertion: When a hiker pushes their body beyond its capabilities without adequate rest, the muscles can eventually fatigue and become more prone to cramping. 3. Lack of conditioning: If a hiker has not adequately prepared their body for the physical demands of hiking, the muscles may not be conditioned well enough to handle the strain and can cramp up. 4. Insufficient stretching: A lack of proper stretching before and during the hike can cause muscle stiffness and reduced flexibility, making cramps more likely. 5. Improper nutrition: A hiker who hasn't consumed enough essential nutrients (such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium) may be more susceptible to cramps due to the imbalance in their body. While the other options provided may also be experienced by someone hiking for miles, cramps are the most directly related to the physical demands of hiking and are a prevalent issue among hikers. Consequently, cramps represent the most appropriate answer for someone who has been hiking for miles. In order to prevent cramps, hikers can take steps such as maintaining proper hydration, stretching, pacing themselves during the hike, and ensuring their diet includes the necessary nutrients to support their muscles and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The column \\"What about the good things Hitler did?\\" appeared last week in the satirical newspaper the Daily Medium, which is funded in part by Rutgers. The column was falsely attributed to a Jewish student writer for an independent Rutgers newspaper, the Daily Targum.      Student writer Aaron Marcus tells WWOR-TV that publication of the piece under his name was hurtful. He says his relatives died in the Holocaust.      Rutgers President Richard McCormick says the article was \\"particularly despicable\\" considering Marcus' Jewish faith.      The Medium's faculty adviser tells The Star-Ledger he hopes whatever action Rutgers takes shows understanding that college is a time when people test boundaries and can learn from their mistakes. ||||| Daily Targum columnist Aaron Marcus filed a bias complaint against The Medium, a weekly satirical newspaper that targets the University community, after the paper ran a column under his name last Wednesday.      The piece, titled, ““What About All the Good Things Hitler Did?” was featured in the annual “The Daily Medium” issue, a spoof of The Daily Targum.      Marcus, a School of Arts and Sciences senior, said the column, which ran with his photo, name and column title, “Marcus My Words,” was meant to promote anti-Semitism on his behalf.      “It’s one thing to write a mock article, and The Medium is known for being offensive and being a satirical newspaper, but it’s another thing to take my name, the picture and title of my column and attribute something so horrific to me,” Marcus said.      The Jewish student, whose pro-Israel messages have created dialogue, debate and controversy in the Targum opinions section, said the special April Fool’s issue — which has a very similar design template to The Daily Targum — fooled a friend, who asked Marcus if he penned the column.      Marcus then filed a bias complaint with the University Thursday morning, which prompted University President Richard L. McCormick to issue a statement about The Medium’s column.      “No individual student should be subject to such a vicious, provocative and hurtful piece, regardless of whether First Amendment protections apply to such expression,” McCormick said in the statement. “The Medium’s article was particularly despicable in light of Mr. Marcus’ Jewish faith.”      Marcus said he has filed the bias complaint because the column pretended to promote anti-Semitism under his name, while upsetting the Jewish community on campus.      “Almost every other Jewish person on campus I’ve spoken to is offended by it,” Marcus said. “Satire is something funny. Bias is when you do something like praising Adolf Hitler and [put] someone else’s words for what you’re actually spewing.”      The University is investigating the bias incident as per the University’ anti-bias policies, McCormick said in the statement.      Marcus said he is reviewing other options, including legal action, but is not completely committed to filing a lawsuit.      Amy DiMaria, The Medium’s editor-in-chief, said the column was meant as satire and should not have been interpreted as anti-Semitic.      The publication chose Marcus because he is largely recognized within the University community because of his column, said DiMaria, a School of Arts and Sciences junior.      “We do it every year, impersonate a Targum columnist as part of ‘The Daily Medium,’” she said. “We chose [Marcus] … based on [his] distinctive writing style that would be easy to parody.”      DiMaria said no one has contacted The Medium so far regarding the investigation into Marcus’ complaint. She said The Medium has never dealt with any formal complaints.      “Even given the subject matter, it’s surprising it’s being taken so seriously,” DiMaria said. “Everyone knows who we are, and we print everything as satire. We’re not out to get anyone or be malicious.”      The column was particularly disheartening to Marcus because of his family’s history.      “The Medium has a right to freedom of speech, but they don’t have the right to impersonate me by printing an anti-Semitic diatribe that praises Adolf Hitler,” he said. “I’m a Jew. My grandparents lost many family members in the Holocaust. This is way over the line.”      Marcus said The Medium was able to print such the piece because the University does not adequately protect Jewish students on campus.      “The University has not taken a firm enough position that anti-Semitism will not be tolerated,” he said. “When push comes to shove, the University has not taken the rights of Jewish students seriously.” ||||| View full size      NEW BRUNSWICK — The faculty adviser of a satirical Rutgers University student newspaper that has come under fire after publishing a column praising Adolf Hitler said the paper's editors \\"will learn something valuable\\" from the incident.      The Medium published the spoof article “What about the good things Hitler did?” last week, and attributed it to Aaron Marcus, a Jewish student activist. Marcus writes actual columns for The Daily Targum, the school's independent student newspaper.      Rutgers is investigating the article as a bias incident, university president Richard McCormick said.      Two editors at The Medium declined to comment today, referring questions to faculty adviser Ronald Miskoff. Reached by e-mail, the journalism lecturer said he does not approve content or see it before it goes to press. He does critique the Medium after it is published.      “I can’t explain the humor in the article,\\" Miskoff said. \\"I suppose it’s more about the irony of a Jewish activist writing something that is the complete opposite of what he really believes.\\"      McCormick blasted the article last week, calling it \\"particularly despicable\\" in light of Marcus' Jewish faith.      \\"No individual student should be subject to such a vicious and provocative and hurtful piece, regardless of whether the First Amendment protections apply to such expression,\\" McCormick said in a statement.      Marcus told My9 WWOR-TV that the article was hurtful, and that some of his relatives died in the Holocaust.      “To say anything praiseworthy of someone like Hitler, and to have people actually believe it was coming from me, even in a satirical manner, is just really painful,” Marcus told the station.      Marcus could not be reached for comment today.      The Daily Targum's editors declined comment.      Miskoff said he had not had contact with administrators yet about the Hitler column as of late today. If any action is taken, he said hoped “it will be with the understanding that college is a time in people’s lives when they test boundaries and learn the results of errors prior to taking on full adult responsibilities.”      “The editors are extremely aware that they have hit a hot-button issue, and I am sure they will learn something valuable from the experience,” he said. “The political swirl that has developed since this article appeared has angered many people, but it also teaches everyone, including the editors, that words hurt.”      Star-Ledger staff writers Jessica Calefati, Ryan Hutchins and Brent Johnson contributed to this report.

Rolf Harris was today linked to Jimmy Savile as it emerged he joined the paedophile on a sick visit to the psychiatric hospital where the DJ habitually abused patients. One of Savile’s victims said Harris ogled vulnerable women as they undressed at Broadmoor in 1973, where the former Top of the Pops star attacked scores of people. Alison Pink remembered the pair suddenly turning up on a women’s ward just as patients were preparing to strip in the corridor and said they were 'birds of a feather'. It came as a video emerged today showing Harris and Savile laughing about how 'we go back a long time' in 1992. The Australian then sketched Savile smoking a trademark cigar, which was sold for £4,500 at a charity auction after his death in 2012. Scroll down for video. New footage: Unseen video reveals how Harris and Savile joked: 'We go back a long time' as Harris drew him in 1992 for his ITV show Rolf's Cartoon Club. Reunion: The interview came almost 20 years after the pair visited Broadmoor together and where a Savile victim said they watched women strip for bed. Artwork: Savile kept hold of the sketch, which was sold for £4,500 after his death in 2012 to raise money for his foundation. New link: Rolf Harris in the grounds of Broadmoor on the same day as Jimmy Savile signing autographs for fans at a fete. One patient told how on the same day the pair had watched vulnerable women undress. Paedophile: Savile abused dozens of women at Broadmoor, where he also had his own set of keys and living quarters. The Broadmoor ex-patient, now called Steven George after a sex change, said: ‘Harris turned up one evening out of the blue. ‘He was being shown around by Savile in an understated way. Normally stars only came if they were there for an official performance but Harris didn’t do one. ‘It. was also unusual because visitors would come at visiting hours, between. 10am and 4pm, but they came in as we were getting ready for bed.’ New pictures reveal that Harris and Savile also signed autographs for children who attended a fete in the grounds. Almost two decades later the pair were reunited by ITV, who filmed them together for Harris' series Rolf's Cartoon Club. Harris had previously appeared on Savile's BBC show Jim'll Fix It. Discussing their careers and how their paths crossed when Harris was a pop star and Savile was on Radio 1 and Top of the Pops they admitted: 'We go back a long time'. Savile smokes a cigar with his tracksuit top unzipped and deliberately confuses Harris with Elvis Presley. Rolf then unveils a sketch, which Savile holds and says: 'I see strong character lines, I see liquid brown eyes and I see the firm jutting chin, all together makes a horrible sight,' and Harris laughs as he says: 'It looks nothing like you.' Twenty years later it was sold after he died in 2012 to raise money for his foundation, at an auction that raised £320,000. Other lots included a glass eye stolen from a corpse, which he then made into a trophy necklace. It is believed to have been worn by the paedophile DJ as he co-presented the final episode of Top of the Pops at BBC Television Centre in 2006, where he also groped a child. 'Birds. of a feather': Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris, pictured appearing. together on Jim'll Fix It, watched women in Broadmoor undress, according. to a former patient. Documented: Harris's visit to the Berkshire hospital in 1973 was mentioned in last week's report on Savile's abuse. Yesterday. Harris, 84, was told he faced an 'inevitable' jail term after he was. found guilty of 12 indecent assaults on four victims between 1968 and. 1986, often in 'plain sight'. 'Jekyll. and Hyde' Harris had used his fame to 'mesmerise' underage fans before. abusing them with impunity and believed his celebrity status made him. believe 'he was above the law', Scotland Yard said. The. Australian star spent 16 years abusing his daughter Bindi's best friend. and got a 'thrill' from attacking her when his own child was feet away. A seven-year-old girl was groped when she asked for his autograph at an event where he performed his hit 'Two Little Boys' for children. Account: A report into Savile's abuse said he had forced Broadmoor patients to strip. Today it emerged that Harris could face fresh charges after more women found the courage to come forward after he was convicted yesterday, the Director of Public Prosecutions said. While 12 others have already approached lawyers to apply for compensation from his £11million estate. His native Australia has also turned on Harris, where he was viewed as a national treasure. The mayor of Perth in western Australia said the council was considering tearing up a plaque to Harris inlaid in the city's St Georges Terrace, while there is growing pressure for the disgraced entertainer to be stripped of his honours from the Queen. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said he was 'gutted and dismayed' by the news of the conviction, telling ABC radio: 'I feel gutted and dismayed but it's very important that we do everything we humanly can to protect vulnerable young people. Sexual abuse is an utterly abhorrent crime. 'It's just sad and tragic that this person who was admired seems to have been a perpetrator.' He will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on Friday. Harris’s visit to Broadmoor hospital in 1973 was mentioned in last week’s report on Savile’s abuse. But police and child protection experts found no evidence of wrongdoing by Harris. The report said Savile forced patients to strip, it stated: ‘We heard convincing accounts of a pattern of inappropriate behaviour surrounding Savile’s attendance on female wards at bath time and bedtime... female patients would be obliged to strip while lined up in corridors. ‘We heard that Savile followed a clear pattern of arriving on a female ward at just before this time. ‘Unchallenged by staff, he would then watch from behind, as the row of female patients undressed.’ Mr George, now 62, first wrote an account of Harris’ Broadmoor visit in his 2012 autobiography 'Heartless'. Guilty: Harris leaves Southwark Crown Court today after he was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault. Disgraced: In Australia a plaque laid in his home town near Perth has been defaced and may be pulled up while prime minister Tony Abbott said he was 'gutted and dismayed' by the news Harris was convicted. He was sent to the high-security psychiatric hospital as a teenager after running away from adoptive parents and setting fire to a property. A woman who says she was abused by Rolf Harris wrote to Buckingham Palace to say: 'He ruined my life. You need to know what kind of man you’ve let near the Queen'. The alleged victim said she was attacked by him as a child and was furious when she learned the artist, 84, was to paint Her Majesty in 2005. The note, written anonymously, was handed to the Queen's Royal Protection Group, linked to Scotland Yard, who filed them as evidence. It wasn't until 2012, when Harris was arrested, that they were investigated. Scotland Yard has refused to comment. Top of the Pops host Savile was a frequent volunteer and was given his own keys and living quarters at the hospital. He recalled how Savile took Harris to Lancaster ward, where women who were being punished had to strip in the corridor in front of warders. He told the Mirror: ‘Harris was very famous at the time and had his weekend show. He walked down the passageway of York ward with Savile opening the doors along with a nursing officer. ‘Some of the girls came out and there was an unprompted performance of Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport. He then went through to the punishment ward. ‘At that time of the evening all the girls on that ward would have been undressed ready for bed. ‘We all had to get completely undressed in the hallway in front of the staff, male and female, to show nothing was being taken into our rooms. ‘I thought it was odd that he was walking through the female wards and not doing a show. It was strange that he arrived at the same time the women were undressing for bed.’ Harris and Savile were pictured together as they signed autographs at a fete in July 1973.

Moreover, they may use social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, to connect with like-minded professionals who could offer valuable insights about the industry. 3. Financial Planning: Given the high pay they are receiving, Sasha might want to ensure that they are managing their finances wisely. This might involve setting clear financial goals, budgeting, and investing in assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. Sasha could potentially seek the assistance of a financial advisor to optimize their financial planning and secure their future. 4. Work-Life Balance: Although Sasha's current job provides substantial financial rewards, they may also want to focus on achieving a healthy work-life balance. This could entail setting boundaries between personal and professional life or finding hobbies and activities outside the workplace that bring them joy and satisfaction. Sasha might want to engage in physical exercises, artistic pursuits, or spending quality time with their friends and family to maintain a balanced lifestyle. 5. Philanthropy and Volunteerism: With the added financial security that their high pay brings, Sasha may feel inspired to give back to their community. They could potentially donate to charitable organizations, partake in volunteering activities, or even mentor aspiring professionals within their industry.

Is In the second half of the 20th Century a modern movement in Nichiren Buddhism: Soka Gakkai (Value Creation Society) emerged in Japan and spread further to other countries. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, it is a partial answer and covers the basic theme. But for a detailed and comprehensive response, there are more elements to be included as well. The mentioned movement, Soka Gakkai, can indeed be categorized as an influential Buddhist movement that emerged in Japan in the second half of the 20th Century. However, it's worth noting that this organization follows the teachings of Nichiren, a 13th-century Japanese monk who emphasized the Lotus Sutra and the chant \\"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo\\" as the key to enlightenment. Nichiren Buddhism was not a new emergence in the 20th century, but Soka Gakkai's interpretation and implementation of it were. Soka Gakkai was initially associated with Nichiren Shōshū, a sect of Nichiren Buddhism, until the split in 1991. Soka Gakkai achieved distinct prominence under the influence of its second president Josei Toda, and then its third, Daisaku Ikeda who is most known for the international spread of the movement. The group propagated Nichiren Buddhism's teachings and philosophy through literature, cultural pursuits, international exchanges, and most notably, through its educational institutions starting from kindergartens to the establishment of Soka University in Japan and its international branches.  The emergence of Soka Gakkai was marked by its mass lay movement and robust propagation activities, which set it apart from the traditional monastic system and more hierarchical, clergy-focused organizations. It emphasizes value creation in daily life, social engagement, and the pursuit of peace, culture, and education. The group's significant growth in post-war Japan and its spread to other countries was greatly determined by these focus areas. Today, Soka Gakkai International (SGI) reports members in 192 countries and territories worldwide.  In conclusion, it is Soka Gakkai, a modern movement within the framework of Nichiren Buddhism, that emerged as a significant Buddhist influence in Japan and globally in the second half of the 20th century. Its strong emphasis on social engagement, education, and outreach has given it an influential role in modern Buddhist practice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.  Now, I have a new situation: Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference.  Answer this question please: Will Jimothy finish his growth spurt before or after Dwight? Answer:","output":"It is likely that Jimothy will finish his growth spurt after Dwight, due to their differences in age and the correlation between testosterone levels and the adolescent growth spurt. As mentioned in the background information provided, the rate of growth during puberty is controlled by testosterone levels in boys, which means that Dwight, being a junior in high school, is likely at a more advanced stage in his puberty and growth spurt compared to his younger brother Jimothy, a freshman in high school. In general, the adolescent growth spurt begins relatively early in puberty and continues for several years, with the peak rate of growth for the average male being about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year. As the body grows, muscle development happens towards the end of the growth spurt in height, and muscles may continue to develop and gain strength even after growth in height is completed. Given that Dwight is older than Jimothy and has significantly higher testosterone levels, it can be inferred that Dwight has likely experienced more rapid growth and is potentially nearing the end of his growth spurt. On the other hand, Jimothy, being younger and having lower testosterone levels, is likely still in the earlier stages of his growth spurt and has some time before he reaches his peak growth rate and eventually completes his adolescent growth spurt. It is important to note that individual growth patterns can vary, depending on factors such as genetics, overall health, and nutrition. However, based on their ages and testosterone levels, it is reasonable to assume that Jimothy will finish his growth spurt after Dwight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Given the question: Information:  - An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences.  - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully.  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - A Singspiel (plural: Singspiele; literally \\"sing-play\\") is a form of German-language music drama, now regarded as a genre of opera. It is characterized by spoken dialogue, which is alternated with ensembles, songs, ballads, and arias which were often strophic, or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of magic, fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil. History. Some of the first Singspiele were miracle plays in Germany, where dialogue was interspersed with singing. By the early 17th century, miracle plays had grown profane, the word \\"Singspiel\\" is found in print, and secular Singspiele were also being performed, both in translated borrowings or imitations from English and Italian songs and plays, and in original German creations.  - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.   - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art.  - Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch.  - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral.  - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter.  - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\".   - Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterin theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode.  - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\").  The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.  - One Thousand and One Nights (\\"kitb alf layla wa-layla\\") is a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English language edition (1706), which rendered the title as \\"The Arabian Nights' Entertainment\\".  - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - Abu Hassan is a comic opera in one act by Carl Maria von Weber to a German libretto by Franz Carl Hiemer , based on a story in One Thousand and One Nights . It was composed between 11 August 1810 and 12 January 1811 and has set numbers with recitative and spoken dialogue . The work is a Singspiel in the then popular Turkish style .  - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.  - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet.  - An aria (plural: \\"arie\\" , or \\"arias\\" in common usage, diminutive form arietta or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods.  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage, an orchestra pit, audience seating, and backstage facilities for costumes and set building. While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers.  - A critic is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.  - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica.  - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.  - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century.  - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.  - Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (18 or 19 November 1786 5 June 1826) was a German composer, conductor, pianist, guitarist and critic, one of the first significant composers of the Romantic school.  - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek  (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from  (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\").  - A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir.  - Recitative (also known by its Italian name \\"recitativo\\") is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition.  - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician.   - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.

The right-hand side of the equation is: 145*i - 129*i - 629*i (145 - 129 - 629) * i = 16 - 629 * i = -613 * i Now, the equation is: 284*i - 12558 = -613*i Step 2: Move all the terms with i to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side. To do this, we will add 613*i to both sides of the equation: 284*i + 613*i - 12558 = -613*i + 613*i Step 3: Simplify the equation after adding 613*i to both sides of the equation.

Solve this instance: Article: A typical lion tamer in people's mind is an entertainer holding a whip( ) at a chair. The whip gets all of the attention, but it's mostly for show. In reality, it's the chair that does the important work. When a lion tamer holds a chair in front of the lion's face, the lion tries to focus on all four legs of the chair at the same time. With its focus divided, the lion becomes confused and is unsure about what to do next. When faced with so many options, the lion chooses to freeze and wait instead of attacking the man holding the chair. How often do you find yourself in the same position as the lion? How often do you have something you want to achieve (e.g. lose weight, start a business, travel more)--only to end up confused by all of the options in front of you and never make progress? This upsets me to no end because while all the experts are busy debating about which option is best, the people who want to improve their lives are left confused by all of the conflicting information.

Choices:  - straighten - and shout - unravel - bend - flat  The rationale to choose \\"straighten\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The correct answer for the given question is \\"straighten.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"straighten\\" as the answer is based on several factors: 1. Context: The context of the sentence suggests that the cord has multiple twists. When a cord is twisted, the most logical action to be taken would be to straighten it out. The individual is holding the cord with both hands, implying that they are trying to fix the issue of the twists present in the cord. 2. Vocabulary and logic: The other choices provided do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.     a. \\"and shout\\": This choice does not serve a purpose for fixing the issue with the cord.    b. \\"unravel\\": This would imply that the cord is tangled or knotted, rather than twisted. Unraveling a cord in the given situation is not the appropriate action.    c. \\"bend\\": Bending the cord would only create more problems, as it does not fix the issue of the twists present in the cord.    d. \\"flat\\": Flattening a cord that is twisted may not rectify the issue and is not a commonly used term for dealing with twisted cords. 3. Appropriate action: Straightening a cord with twists is a common solution to the issue. Holding the cord with both hands would provide the leverage required to remove the twists and regain the cord's original, untwisted state. Moreover, straightening the cord can improve its functionality and appearance, ensuring it is safe to use and free of any damage. 4. Sentence structure: The sentence's structure indicates that the person is attempting a single action with the cord, which implies that the word to complete it must be an appropriate verb that denotes an action. Out of all the given choices, \\"straighten\\" is the most suitable verb that signifies an action relevant to the context of the sentence. Taking all of these factors into account, the most appropriate and logical answer to fill in the blank in the given question is \\"straighten.\\" The individual is likely trying to straighten the cord to eliminate the twists and improve its overall usability and condition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two accept the assignment because the money is good, even though they disbelieve her story. Late that night, police detective Tom Polhaus (J. Farrell MacDonald) informs Spade that Archer has been shot and killed while tailing Thursby, but Spade turns down the opportunity to examine the body at the scene. As he's leaving, he has a brief conversation in Chinese with a man loitering in a doorway. Later, Polhaus and his superior, Lt. Dundy (Robert Elliott), visit Spade at his apartment.

The main character becomes an unwilling host for the restless spirit of J.D. Walker, a hustler killed 30 years earlier when he was wrongfully accused of killing his sister. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"J.D.'s Revenge influenced countless films to come.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to definitively conclude that \\"J.D.'s Revenge influenced countless films to come.\\" This is because there is no mention of its impact on the industry, its reception by audiences and critics, or any specific examples of films it may have influenced in the years that followed its release. However, it is possible to explore some aspects of J.D.'s Revenge that could have had an impact on future films. J.D.'s Revenge is classified as a blaxploitation horror film. Blaxploitation refers to a subgenre of films that emerged in the United States during the 1970s. These films specifically targeted African American audiences, and often included storylines and themes related to urban crime, anti-establishment sentiment, and racial politics. Since the 1970s is considered the golden age of blaxploitation movies, J.D.'s Revenge's release in 1976 situates it within this influential era of American cinema. J.D.'s Revenge combines elements of blaxploitation and horror, creating a unique take on the revenge narrative. Glynn Turman's character becomes possessed by the restless spirit of J.D. Walker, a hustler who was killed 30 years earlier after being wrongfully accused of murdering his sister. This combination of genres could have potentially inspired filmmakers to explore similar mashups of genre, style, and social commentary in their works. Additionally, J.D.'s Revenge stars notable actors Glynn Turman and Lou Gossett. These actors are recognizable figures within American cinema, particularly within the blaxploitation subgenre. Their involvement may have opened doors for other African American actors and filmmakers, emboldening creators to explore themes of race, injustice, and revenge in their storytelling. However, it's important to note that while the elements discussed above may have contributed to J.D.'s Revenge's potential impact on American cinema, the presented paragraph does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively conclude that the film influenced countless films to come. To determine its lasting impact, further research into the film's box office figures, critical reception, and coverage in the media would be necessary to better understand how its themes, style, and performances might have resonated with and influenced fellow filmmakers and movies in the years to come."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

She was born Rosa Ponzillo on January 22, 1897, in Meriden, Connecticut, the youngest of three children. The family lived on the city's west side in a neighborhood chiefly populated by immigrants from the south of Italy, first at the corner of Lewis Avenue and Bartlett Street, then on Foster Street, where Ponselle was born, moving when she was three to Springdale Avenue. Her parents were Italian immigrants from Caiazzo, near Caserta. Ponselle had an exceptionally mature voice at an early age and, at least in her early years, sang on natural endowment with little, if any, vocal training. Outside the USA, Ponselle sang only at Covent Garden in London (for three seasons) and in Italy (in order, so she said, to honor a promise she had made to her mother that she would one day sing in Italy). In 1929, Ponselle made her European debut in London, at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. Up until that time, her career had been concentrated entirely in America. Ponselle sang two roles at Covent Garden in 1929: Norma and Gioconda. She had great success and was tumultuously acclaimed by the normally staid London audiences. She returned to London in 1930 in Norma, L'amore dei tre re, and La traviata (her first performances as Violetta). In her final London season in 1931, she sang in La forza del destino, Fedra (an opera by her coach and long-time friend, Romano Romani), and a reprise of La traviata.  In 1933 Ponselle sang her only performances in Italy, as Giulia in La vestale, with the Maggio Musicale in Florence. As in London, the audiences were wildly enthusiastic. At the second performance, Ponselle had to encore the aria, \\"O nume tutelar\\". Her success was such that she considered an engagement at Milan's La Scala, but after witnessing a Florence audience's brutal treatment of a famous tenor, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, who cracked on a high note, she decided not to press her luck further with the notoriously difficult Italian opera-going public. Other than her appearances in London and Florence, Ponselle never sang outside the United States.  Ponselle continued in the 1930s to add roles to her repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera. In 1930 she sang her first New York appearances in 1931 as Violetta, a role she had sung with such success in London, received a more mixed reception from the New York critics, some of whom found her interpretation too forceful and dramatic. (W.J. Henderson complained of her \\"assaults\\" on the vocal line.) In 1931 she sang in another unsuccessful world premiere, Montemezzi's La notte di Zoraima, which sank without a trace. Like many other opera singers of that time, she made a brief trip to Hollywood and made screen tests for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures, but nothing came of them.  In 1935, Ponselle sang her first Carmen at the Met. In spite of a great popular success with the role, for which she had prepared meticulously, Ponselle received a drubbing from most of the New York critics, especially Olin Downes in the New York Times, whose savagely caustic review hurt Ponselle deeply. The only roles Ponselle sang during her last two seasons at the Met were Santuzza and Carmen, roles that did not tax her upper register. Differences with the Met management regarding repertoire led her not to renew her contract with the company for the 1937/38 season. Her last operatic performance was as Carmen on April 22, 1937, in a Met tour performance in Cleveland.","output":"This text is about Rosa Ponselle, an American opera singer born on January 22, 1897, in Meriden, Connecticut."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Manchester Art Gallery has a bronze sculpture of Vaughan Williams by Epstein (1952) and the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has drawings by Joyce Finzi (1947) and Juliet Pannett (1957 and 1958); versions of a bronze head of the composer by David McFall (1956) are in the NPG and at the entrance to the Music reading room of the British Library. There is a statue of Vaughan Williams in Dorking, and a bust in Chelsea Embankment Gardens, near his old house in Cheyne Walk.In 1994 a group of enthusiasts founded the Ralph Vaughan Williams Society, with the composer's widow as its president and Roy Douglas and Michael Kennedy as vice presidents. The society, a registered charity, has sponsored and encouraged performances of the composer's works including complete symphony cycles and a Vaughan Williams opera festival. The society has promoted premieres of neglected works, and has its own record label, Albion Records.Composers of the generation after Vaughan Williams reacted against his style, which became unfashionable in influential musical circles in the 1960s; diatonic and melodic music such as his was neglected in favour of atonal and other modernist compositions. In the 21st century this neglect has been reversed. In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released: Tony Palmer's O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Vaughan Williams and John Bridcut's The Passions of Vaughan Williams. British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer. The popularity of his most accessible works, particularly the Tallis Fantasia and The Lark Ascending increased, but a wide public also became aware of what a reviewer of Bridcut's film called \\"a genius driven by emotion\\".

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Legislation regarding marriage varies from country to country, but in most Western countries, including the United States, Canada, and many European nations, the legal definition of marriage specifically precludes unions with more than two people. Polygamy was once relatively common in various cultural and religious contexts, but it has been largely phased out over time in favor of monogamous relationships. However, there are still some countries, particularly those where Islamic laws and customs play a significant role, that permit polygamous marriages, typically allowing a man to have up to four wives. While it is not legal to have a three-way marriage in most jurisdictions, some places have taken steps toward greater legal recognition for non-traditional relationships. In these locales, people involved in polyamorous relationships may have increased rights and protections, such as access to domestic partnership or civil union status, which can provide some of the legal benefits of marriage, though typically not to the same extent as a legally recognized marriage. However, it is important to note that the legal status of polyamorous relationships can be complex, and a lack of comprehensive legal recognition may open the door for complications in areas such as property division, child custody, inheritance, or access to healthcare and social services. Additionally, those engaging in a non-legally recognized three-way relationship may still face prejudice, discrimination, or stigma as they navigate various social and legal situations. In conclusion, while the legality of three-way marriages remains firmly restricted in the majority of countries, changing societal attitudes and the push for broader recognition of diverse relationship structures may eventually lead to changes in legislation. For now, individuals involved in polyamorous arrangements must rely on alternative arrangements, such as cohabitation agreements or other legal tools, to protect their interests and preserve the unique dynamics of their relationships."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"the Yiddish concept of Jewishness includes\\"  Context: \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The Yiddish concept of Jewishness, or Yiddishkeit, encompasses various aspects that define the identity and cultural practices of Ashkenazi Jews. Traditionally, this included the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for both men and women. Most Ashkenazi Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. With modernization, Yiddishkeit has evolved to include not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism but also a wide range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions that contribute to a sense of Jewishness among Ashkenazi Jews. Although fewer Jews speak Yiddish today, Yiddishkeit can still be identified in various elements such as manners of speech, styles of humor, and patterns of association. Broadly, a Jew who aligns with the concept of Yiddishkeit associates culturally with other Jews, supports Jewish institutions, engages with Jewish literature and media, attends Jewish events and performances, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and participates in various other activities related to Jewish culture.

Davey Gillen, a new IRA prisoner, arrives; he is categorised as a \\"non-conforming prisoner\\" for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked with only a blanket. His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards are seen snickering as they are handed to the prisoners who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot police are seen coming into the prison on a truck. They line up and beat their batons against their shields and scream to scare the prisoners, who are hauled from their cells, then forced to run the gauntlet between the lines of riot police where they are beaten with the batons by at least 10 men at one time.

Premise: \\"For example, we are developing the variation that we call the cumulative case study.\\" The premise suggests that the speaker and their team are actively working on a project, specifically developing a variation of a case study which they refer to as the cumulative case study. This statement implies that progress is being made and that there is an ongoing effort to continue the development of this variation. Hypothesis: \\"We're too lazy to develop anything.\\" The hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it claims that the speaker and their team are not motivated or willing to put in any effort in developing anything. This statement assumes a lack of productivity and initiative on the part of the team. Upon comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it's clear that one does not entail the other. In fact, they seem to be contradictory statements. The premise suggests active engagement in developing a specific variation of a case study, while the hypothesis claims no motivation or initiative for development altogether. Thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. However, it is important to note that the hypothesis could be a subjective viewpoint or an expression of internal doubt by the team, where they might feel that they are not putting enough effort or getting the intended results. In such a case, the hypothesis would not be entailed by the premise, but rather coexist with it as two separate perspectives on the same situation, one being objective and the other subjective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What is probably true about the author?

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion. According to the above context, answer the following question. The author believes that: Select from the following. a). people should brainstorm new ideas b). people should make an effort for the holidays c). people should be thankful and grateful d). not enough information Answer:","output":"c). people should be thankful and grateful"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It exposes children to science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) through hands-on activities.      The Camp Invention Program, created by Invent Now Kids, was founded in 1990. Now it has grown to include almost l,500 sites across the U. S., with thousands of children attending the program each year.      \\"Our main purpose is to help children develop a greater interest in the fields of STEM,\\" said Lori Bryne, the Senior Regional Program Manager. Children in the camp will be given the opportunity to explore the unknown and put ideas into practice.      The program will challenge children to real world situations that will help them build a team spirit and life skills.      The program will include five modules this year.      One module will feature \\"Problem Solving on Planet ZAK\\". It will challenge children by creating a world of science fiction. Imitating a \\"crash\\" onto a planet, children will be asked to figure out ways to stay safe, find food and to \\"rebuild\\" their spacecraft, using a variety of common objects.      Another module will be \\"Saving Sludge City\\" which will have children find ways to create a cleaner and eco-friendly city.     \\"Imagination Point: Ride Physics\\" asks children to work as interns   in the world's newest and largest theme park called \\"Imagination Point\\". Children will learn the basic principles of motion through hands-on activities related directly to rides.      Another feature of the camp will be the \\"I Can Invent\\" which will focus on the real world of inventions by having children explore the process of invention.      The final module will be \\"Global Games\\" which will introduce games ranging from those played in ancient times to the present day to children.      \\"We want to encourage children to go into the fields of STEM,\\" Bryne said. \\"This program is a fun way to do that.\\" Question: Which feature of the camp can make children learn the basic principles of motion?

Premise: \\"Many of the claims of H-2A workers are legally complex, and all take months, if not years, to litigate to completion.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The claims of H-2A workers are adjudicated within 24 hours by law.\\"?","output":"If the premise that \\"Many of the claims of H-2A workers are legally complex, and all take months, if not years, to litigate to completion\\" is true, then we can infer that the hypothesis \\"The claims of H-2A workers are adjudicated within 24 hours by law\\" is most likely false or not entirely accurate. This is because there is a clear contradiction between the complexity of the legal issues mentioned in the premise and the expedited adjudication timeframe proposed in the hypothesis. The H-2A temporary agricultural program, a part of the Immigration and Nationality Act, addresses the employment of foreign workers in the United States in agricultural jobs that are seasonal in nature. The H-2A visa program has provisions for employers to hire foreign workers when there is a lack of available domestic workers to fulfill the demand for seasonal agricultural jobs. When we consider the premise, we have to understand that claims of H-2A workers could include issues such as labor disputes, wage disagreements, working conditions, contract disputes, terminations, and potential violations of the workers' rights. Given the various laws and regulations that govern such matters, it is understandable that resolving these claims could be legally complex. Regulations governing the H-2A program are enforced by multiple agencies, including the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of State. These agencies have specific and varied roles in the process, which can make claims filed by H-2A workers more complex than other legal cases. The nature and complexity of these claims make it extremely difficult to adjudicate them within a short period, as suggested in the hypothesis. In reality, such cases often involve investigations, evidence gathering, witness examinations, and thorough legal analyses. It is not feasible to go through these processes and come to a fair and equitable resolution within a timeframe as brief as 24 hours. Moreover, the inclusion of the phrase \\"by law\\" in the hypothesis suggests that there could be a legal mandate establishing the 24-hour adjudication period. This would mean that it would be legally required for these claims to be resolved within 24 hours, which seems highly unlikely due to the logistical impracticality and the fact that it would likely not allow for thorough and fair resolutions. In conclusion, assuming the premise is accurate, it contradicts the hypothesis that \\"The claims of H-2A workers are adjudicated within 24 hours by law.\\" If the claims of H-2A workers are indeed legally complex and take months or even years to be litigated to completion, it's nearly impossible for the claims to be adjudicated within 24 hours, as stated in the hypothesis. This suggests that the hypothesis is likely false or misinformed, and the actual legal process for addressing the claims of H-2A workers is more intricate and time-consuming than suggested."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was excited, more at the thought of being cared for on Father's Day than of the present. She always said she liked her Father's Day memories better than the Mother's Day ones. It made her feel special -- and she was. I have noticed in the past few years, greeting cards are even made for \\"Mother on Father's Day\\". Ever since then, my mother has got cards on Father's Day. By the way, she knew just how to use those tools and others she had ever used over the years. Options: A My parents divorced when I was 8 years old.

The second sentence only mentions that the boy is \\"outside\\", but does not specify the location as the first sentence does. Based on these comparisons, we can reasonably conclude that the following key components hold true for both sentences: 1. There is a boy 2. The boy is riding a bike However, the second sentence lacks specificity about the location, as it only states the boy is \\"outside.\\" Although it can be inferred that the woods are also \\"outside,\\" the second sentence is not completely descriptive compared to the first sentence.

There are a few reasons to consider it as negative: 1. Low star rating: The reviewer gave the establishment only 2 stars out of a possible 5. This usually implies that the reviewer was not satisfied with the overall experience. 2. Quality of food: Although the reviewer mentioned that some of the food was great, they also noted that most of it was just average, indicated by the use of \\"meh.\\" This suggests that while they may have liked a few items, the majority of the food was not particularly enjoyable. 3. Limited selection: A significant part of the review mentions that the selection of food was small, which can be seen as a negative aspect. If an establishment offers a limited choice of dishes, especially in a buffet setting, customers may feel that they are not getting their money's worth, and it may affect their overall satisfaction. 4. Mixed opinion on price: While the reviewer mentioned that the price was cheap for a dinner buffet, they also commented that the quality of the experience did not necessarily match the low cost. This implies that the low price might not be enough to overcome the other issues mentioned in the review (food quality and limited selection).

Harlem Answer:","output":"Title: Blonsky's Harlem Havoc Plot: In the bustling streets of Harlem, New York City, life seems to be going on as usual. However, it all changes when Dr. Adrian Blonsky (played by an A-list actor), a talented physicist and researcher working for a top-secret government lab, is exposed to an experimental formula designed to enhance human performance. The formula goes terribly wrong, causing Blonsky to transform into a giant, monstrous creature with exceptional strength and an unrelenting rage. As the frightening creature, Blonsky rampages through Harlem in a blind fury. He leaves a trail of destruction in his wake, tearing down buildings, and putting the lives of innocent New Yorkers in danger. The city is gripped with fear as news crews attempt to cover the monster's movements from a safe distance, amplifying the chaos and uncertainty among the public. In the midst of all the destruction, a group of Harlem residents bands together, determined to save their neighborhood from Blonsky's wrath. This unlikely group of heroes – a struggling musician, a retired police detective, a firefighter, a tenacious young woman, and a street-savvy teenager – formulates a plan to neutralize Blonsky's out-of-control rage, using their knowledge of Harlem's unique culture, history, and tight-knit community. While the government's military forces try to contain the situation, often complicating matters with their heavy-handed tactics, Blonsky's former colleague and girlfriend, brilliant scientist Dr. Maria Ramirez (played by another A-list actress), joins the Harlem group in their efforts. Dr. Ramirez provides invaluable information about Blonsky's condition, revealing that there might still be hope to reverse the effects of the formula and save him before it's too late. As Blonsky continues to destroy Harlem, the group faces a race against time to execute their daring plan, while evading various threats from different directions – including other mutated creatures emerging from the shadows, attracted by Blonsky's violent outbursts. In a thrilling climax, the team's resilience and resourcefulness lead to a spectacular confrontation, where they are able to calm the raging beast within Blonsky. Dr. Ramirez administers the antidote just in the nick of time, sparing his life and returning him to his human form. Exhausted but alive, Blonsky and Ramirez are reunited, and the government's nefarious experiments are exposed, resulting in the program's shutdown. Finally, Harlem's citizens rally together to rebuild their beloved neighborhood, and the bonds between the heroes grow stronger as they vow to keep their community safe from any future threats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The campaign encourages consumers to share their personal connection to newspapers through the papers' Facebook and Twitter accounts -- with the hashtag #smartsexy -- to spark conversations online.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is accused of being a devil? , can you please find it?   Set in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue.

Select from the following. +Use high grit sandpaper and buff the nut until it shines +Use a cloth and buff the nut ring until it begins to shine Answer:","output":"The best way to polish the nut ring after shaping it is to use high grit sandpaper and buff the nut until it shines.  Step 1: Select a high grit sandpaper (such as 800-1500 grit) for a smoother polish. High grit sandpaper is finer, and therefore, more suitable for polishing a nut ring without causing any damage or scratches. Step 2: Hold the nut ring firmly, either with your hand or by placing it in a vise if possible. Ensuring the nut ring is secure will make it easier to apply even pressure while polishing. Step 3: Use the high grit sandpaper to gently buff the nut ring in a circular motion while applying even pressure. This will help remove any small imperfections and create a smooth finish. Step 4: Periodically change the sandpaper to a higher grit (for example, progress from 800 to 1500 grit) to further refine the polish. As you increase the grit of the sandpaper, the nut ring will gradually begin to shine. Step 5: Once the desired level of polish is achieved, wipe the nut ring clean with a soft cloth to remove any sanding dust and debris. This will give the nut ring a shiny, polished appearance. Opting for high grit sandpaper over a cloth provides a more effective method of polishing the nut ring because it allows for faster, more precise polishing while also minimizing the risk of scratches or damage."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: what can a dog sometimes be taught to do?

Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language. Commonly cited examples include Ainu, Basque, Korean and Sumerian, though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages.  - Sumerian (\\"native tongue\\") is the language of ancient Sumer and a language isolate which was spoken in southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a \\"Sprachbund\\" (area of linguistic convergence).  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.  - Sumer was the first urban civilization in the historical region of southern Mesopotamia, modern-day southern Iraq, during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze ages, and arguably the first civilization in the world with Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley. Living along the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, Sumerian farmers were able to grow an abundance of grain and other crops, the surplus of which enabled them to settle in one place.  - Sumerian literature is the literature written in the Sumerian language during the Middle Bronze Age . Most Sumerian literature is preserved indirectly , via Assyrian or Babylonian copies . The Sumerians invented the first writing system , developing Sumerian cuneiform writing out of earlier proto - writing systems by about the 30th century BC. The earliest literary texts appear from about the 27th century BC. The Sumerian language remained in official and literary use in the Akkadian and Babylonian empires , even after the spoken language disappeared from the population ; literacy was widespread , and the Sumerian texts that students copied heavily influenced later Babylonian literature .  - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian  (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders.  - Babylonia was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). A small Amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained at this time the minor city of Babylon. Babylon greatly expanded during the reign of Hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century BC, becoming a major capital city. During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called \\"Mt Akkad\\" \\"the country of Akkad\\" in the Akkadian language. It was often involved in rivalry with its older fellow Akkadian-speaking state of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi (fl. c. 1792  1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696  1654 BC, short chronology) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire, Third Dynasty of Ur, and Old Assyrian Empire; however, the Babylonian empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi.  - A sprachbund (\\"federation of languages\\")  also known as a linguistic area, area of linguistic convergence, diffusion area or language crossroads  is a group of languages that have common features resulting from geographical proximity and language contact. They may be genetically unrelated, or only distantly related. Where genetic affiliations are unclear, the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness. Areal features are common features of a group of languages in a sprachbund.  - In anthropology and geography, a cultural region, cultural sphere, cultural area or culture area refers to a geographical area with one relatively homogeneous human activity or complex of activities (culture). These are often associated with an ethnolinguistic group and the territory it inhabits. Specific cultures often do not limit their geographic coverage to the borders of a nation state, or to smaller subdivisions of a state. Cultural \\"spheres of influence\\" may also overlap or form concentric structures of macrocultures encompassing smaller local cultures. Different boundaries may also be drawn depending on the particular aspect of interest, such as religion and folklore vs. dress and architecture vs. language.    What is the relationship between 'sumerian literature' and 'culture'? A:","output":"The relationship between Sumerian literature and culture lies in the fact that literature from this period provides valuable insights into the beliefs, values, customs, social structures, and everyday life of the Sumerian civilization. As one of the earliest forms of written expression, Sumerian literature can be viewed as an essential component of the culture, reflecting and preserving the thoughts, ideas, and history of this ancient civilization. By studying Sumerian literature, we gain a better understanding of the cultural aspects that shaped the society and its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This groundbreaking decision reflects the country's growing inclusivity and support for the LGBTQ+ community. Step 1: Introduce the event and its significance The signing of this bill into law marks a monumental occasion for the Republic of Ireland, as it joins a growing list of countries around the world that have legislated for same-sex marriage. The bill's passage through both the Dáil and the Seanad, as well as its final signatures from the Presidential Commission, demonstrates a strong commitment to the attainment of equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation.  Step 2: Discuss key moments leading up to the event This decision comes after years of increasing public pressure and activism. In 2015, Ireland became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage through a popular vote. Over 60% of the population took part in the referendum, with a resounding 62% majority voting in favor of marriage equality. This marked a significant shift in attitude when compared to the 1993 decriminalization of homosexuality in Ireland.  Step 3: Detail the contents of the bill  The bill allows same-sex couples to enjoy the same legal rights, protections, and responsibilities as heterosexual couples in relation to marriage. These include provisions regarding inheritance, tax benefits, property rights, and adoption rights. It also provides access to next-of-kin arrangements, so one's spouse is rightfully recognized and supported in emergencies or critical care situations. Step 4: Highlight public reaction and opinion The news of the bill's signing into law has been met with widespread joy and celebration throughout Ireland and the international community. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, like Marriage Equality Ireland and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, have praised this legislation, stating that it represents a vital step towards full acceptance and recognition for same-sex couples. Step 5: Address possible future developments Although this development is monumental for the Republic of Ireland, many advocates recognize that there is still work to be done. Areas that still need attention include the continued fight against conversion therapy, the rights of trans individuals, and support for LGBTQ+ youth. Advocacy groups hope that the signing of this bill will pave the way for further progress in these areas.  Conclusion: The Republic of Ireland's same-sex marriage bill, signed into law by the Presidential Commission, is a watershed moment for the nation. It showcases the public's dedication to promoting inclusivity and equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. This groundbreaking decision not only benefits same-sex couples who can now enjoy equal rights and protections, but it also demonstrates the potential for continued progress towards broader LGBTQ+ rights and recognition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In which area has excavations uncovered substantial evidence of habitation?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the... The answer to this question is:","output":"Excavations in the region south of the Temple Mount have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times.

Please answer the following question: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would  be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B.  Which reactants would have particle's with lower energy, reactant A or reactant B?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, reactant B would have particles with lower energy. This is because reactant B consists of cooler reactants, and when reactants have a lower temperature, the particles have less energy. This lower energy results in slower movement and a reduced rate of reaction. In contrast, reactant A, which has warmer reactants, would have particles with more energy, leading to faster movement and an increased rate of reaction. This concept is why we store food in colder temperatures to slow down the spoilage process due to chemical reactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Build a movie plot around this: Who sacrifices himself against the cyborg? Waylander A:","output":"Title: Waylander - The Cyborg Resistance Step 1: Establish the Setting The story takes place in a dystopian future where technology has taken over humanity's daily life. Cyborgs, half-human and half-machines, are the dominant force and rule with an iron grip. Humans are oppressed, and many have lost all hope for a better future. Step 2: Introduce the Main Characters - Waylander: A brave and skilled rebel fighter, who has managed to stay ahead of the Cyborg Regime. He's haunted by a mysterious past and feels a strong sense of loyalty to humanity. - Lila: A brilliant scientist, who has dedicated her life to find a way to level the playing field between humans and cyborgs. She soon becomes a valuable asset to the resistance and Waylander's closest ally. - Commander Xander: The ruthless cyborg leader, who shows no mercy to the human resistance. His main goal is to crush any opposition and maintain absolute control over humanity. Step 3: The Inciting Incident While on a mission to steal crucial information from the Cyborg Regime, Waylander discovers Lila, who was imprisoned for her research on a potential weapon to disable the cyborgs. Waylander frees her, and together they escape the heavily guarded facility, making them both high-priority targets for Commander Xander. Step 4: Rising Action Lila finishes her research and creates a powerful device that can weaken a cyborg's internal energy source. As they travel together, she teaches Waylander about her invention and how to strategically use it. As the duo's reputation grows among the humans, more people join their resistance movement, escalating their battle against the cyborgs. Step 5: The Climax Commander Xander, fed up with Waylander's continued success, kidnaps Lila to lure Waylander into a trap. Using Lila's weapon, Waylander storms the enemy's stronghold, but finds himself faced with an army of cyborgs led by Commander Xander himself. Step 6: The Ultimate Sacrifice Waylander realizes that he will not be able to defeat the remaining cyborgs and save his friends. He makes the difficult decision to overload Lila's weapon and use it to create an explosion, intending to eliminate the entire Cyborg Regime. Waylander shares a heartfelt farewell with Lila before sending her and the remaining rebels to safety. He then sacrifices himself by detonating the weapon, destroying the Cyborg Regime and giving humanity a fighting chance. Step 7: Resolution Lila and the remaining rebels carry on Waylander's legacy as they continue to battle for humanity's freedom. They use the knowledge and tactics Lila taught them during their time together, giving them the upper hand they need to slowly reclaim control. With each passing day, the tide turns more in humanity's favor, and stories of Waylander's sacrifice inspire future generations. In summary, \\"Waylander - The Cyborg Resistance\\" is a story about hope, sacrifice, and the power of human spirit. Waylander's ultimate selflessness saves humanity from the oppressive rule of the cyborgs, proving that even one person can make a difference in the lives of many."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Refrigerator: This could be a reasonable option for storing perishable items that need to be kept cold, such as meat, dairy products, and some fruits and vegetables. 2. Supermarket: This option does not make sense, as groceries have already been bought and brought to the house, so there is no need to return them to the supermarket. 3. Pantry: This is also a reasonable option for storing non-perishable items, such as canned goods, pasta, and cereal. 4.

Choices:  - drowsiness - sleeping in - insomnia - exercise - pregnancy  The rationale to choose \\"pregnancy\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Pregnancy is the most likely cause for someone to gain weight and go to bed early among the given choices. Here's the rationale for choosing pregnancy: 1. Weight gain: During pregnancy, a woman is expected to gain weight as the baby grows inside her womb. This is due to the increase in blood volume, amniotic fluid, and fat stores that provide energy for the developing baby. Additionally, the placenta, uterine muscle, and breast tissue also contribute to weight gain. In a healthy pregnancy, a gradual weight gain is typical and essential for the well-being of the mother and baby. 2. Going to bed early: Pregnant women often experience fatigue and increased sleepiness, especially during the first trimester. The body is undergoing many physiological changes and producing more hormones, such as progesterone, which can cause drowsiness. As the baby grows, the physical demands on the mother's body also increase, contributing to the need for additional rest. Thus, pregnant women may feel the need to go to bed early to ensure they are getting enough sleep. In comparison, the other choices are less likely to simultaneously cause weight gain and early bedtime: - Drowsiness: While drowsiness can cause someone to go to bed early, it does not directly contribute to weight gain. - Sleeping in: Sleeping in might indicate an increased need for sleep but does not cause weight gain by itself. - Insomnia: Insomnia may disrupt sleep patterns but has no direct connection to weight gain. In fact, a lack of sleep may lead to weight loss in some cases. - Exercise: Regular exercise generally promotes weight loss or maintenance, rather than weight gain, and may actually help regulate sleep patterns. Taking all these factors into account, \\"pregnancy\\" is the most logical choice as the answer for causing both weight gain and going to bed early."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Atlantic Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis), also known as the man-of-war, is a marine hydrozoan of the family Physaliidae found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its long tentacles deliver a painful sting, which is venomous and powerful enough to kill fish or (rarely) humans. Despite its appearance, the Portuguese man o' war is not a true jellyfish but a siphonophore, which is not actually a single multicellular organism (true jellyfish are single organisms), but a colonial organism made up of specialized individual animals (of the same species) called zooids or polyps. These polyps are attached to one another and physiologically integrated, to the extent that they cannot survive independently, creating a symbiotic relationship, requiring each polyp to work together and function like an individual animal. See options at the end. Can we conclude that can you survive a man of war sting? Choices: (a). no (b). yes","output":"(b). yes It is possible to survive a Portuguese man o' war sting.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did Prince Manuel only rule for three years?\\" is \\"He died after three years\\"?","output":"According to the paragraph, the reason Prince Manuel only ruled for three years is not that he died after three years. Instead, it was because a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910, causing the end of Portugal's monarchy. Manuel then went into exile and died in England in 1932, more than two decades after his deposition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Our love then grew through a 5-year long-distance relationship. We were able to survive despite our pursuit to become a doctor and a lawyer. He was at the University of Michigan School of Medicine and I was at the University of Maryland School of Law. We encouraged each other. David proposed to me on May 15, 2011 in front of both of our families. It was amazing!

We could not afford a backdrop   to go behind the bridal party, so we made one out of tissue and two enormous peg boards. It was awesome. Many people wanted to buy our backdrop, but I gave it to our linen designer because he gave us crazy discounts.    David designed our guestbook by using the Apple iphone photobook application. It was awesome. He came up with the title \\"Witness to love: David and Susan's Wedding Day\\" for the cover and then on the inside he stated this, in part, \\"Bearing Witness: Thank you for being a witness to our covenant   with God as we commit ourselves to join as one...\\" I was moved deeply by his beautiful words.

Why do so many people post questions on Quora that could be easily and thoroughly answered by simply typing the question into any search engine? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose your answer from: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"[b]. yes; The two questions can indeed be considered paraphrases of each other, as they both address the same core idea: the rationale behind people asking questions on Quora that could readily be answered through a search engine. To provide a more detailed analysis of why people behave this way, I'll further break down the possible reasons and factors contributing to this behavior: 1. **Convenience**: Some people might find it more convenient to ask questions on a platform like Quora, which facilitates interactions and discussions, rather than merely relying on search engine results. They may be already using Quora for other purposes and prefer to keep their inquiries consolidated within the same platform. 2. **Personalized answers**: When asking a question on Quora, users may receive responses tailored specifically to their concerns. Search engines can provide a vast array of information, but not all of it may be relevant or personalized to the individual asking the question. Quora allows them to obtain more context-specific answers from people with unique experiences and perspectives. 3. **Human connection**: Engaging in conversations and asking questions on platforms like Quora fosters a sense of community and connection with other users. Instead of simply obtaining information from search engines, individuals can interact with others who have shared experiences or expertise in a specific field. This creates a more human, and often more satisfying, learning experience. 4. **Subjective opinions**: Certain questions may call for subjective viewpoints or opinions, rather than objective facts. Quora is a suitable platform for soliciting diverse perspectives from different people, whereas search engines can sometimes present predominantly factual, objective information. 5. **Clarity and comprehension**: Some users may struggle to understand or interpret the raw information provided by search engines. In such cases, asking a question on Quora allows them to receive detailed explanations and examples. Quora's responses tend to be in a conversational format, which can make complex information more palatable and accessible. 6. **Up-to-date information**: Quora can also expedite access to information by providing users with the most recent updates and developments on a topic, as many users actively participate to share fresh insights. Conversely, search engines may occasionally offer outdated resources or information. 7. **Confirmation bias**: Lastly, it is possible that some users gravitate towards Quora to seek confirmation of their pre-existing beliefs. Engaging with others who share similar opinions can reinforce their convictions and provide them with a sense of validation. In essence, while search engines are invaluable tools for swiftly delivering information, platforms like Quora offer the unique opportunity for users to engage with others, receive personalized answers, and foster a sense of community while learning. These different factors contribute to the popularity of Quora as a platform for asking questions that may be just as efficiently answered through search engines."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

Article:They are angry that the NHS is considering merging Scotland's two facilities, in the east and west, into one clinic based in Glasgow. The Cleft Lip and Palate Association has called for more detail about why the move to a single centre is needed. The Scottish government said no final decisions have been made. Almost 100 babies are born every year in Scotland with a cleft lip or palate. Surgery can help them talk and eat. Scotland has two clinics  - in Edinburgh and Glasgow - which specialise in these surgical procedures. A public consultation is currently taking place about plans to merge them into one surgical centre, based at the new Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. Parents opposed to the plan have started a petition and gathered more than 3,500 signatures. They argue the service in Glasgow has poorer results but senior NHS managers have insisted the single-handed surgical service in Edinburgh is not sustainable. A public consultation meeting is being held in Edinburgh later, with another due to take place in Glasgow on Thursday. The Cleft Lip and Palate Association, a voluntary organisation offering advice and support to those affected by the condition, said it was important that the views of patients were heard in the consultation process. It previously said it wanted the surgical service to remain on two sites because of \\"a lack of evidence to show that the existing structure wasn't working\\". It has urged the NHS to provide further detail \\"on either the issues with the current two centre model or the structure of a service based at one centre\\". A spokeswoman said: \\"We will continue to ask for clear and transparent sharing of information regarding the review and its recommendation to move to a single centre, and we are also vigilant on the potential erosion of services across cleft teams as NHS budgets come under increasing pressure. \\"We actively encourage all those in the cleft community, children and adults, to respond to the consultation process and to include CLAPA (Scotland) in their correspondence so we can continue to monitor the situation and ensure a broad spectrum of voices are heard at this crucial time in the consultation process.\\" Health Secretary Shona Robison said the review was an \\"on-going process\\" and that no final decisions had been made. She added: \\"A consultation is underway, and the views of patients and families, are not just welcome, but an extremely important part of the process. \\"It's important to state that this review applies only to specialist surgery services. It does not impact on other important cleft unit services such as orthodontist treatment, speech and language therapy and dentistry, which will continue to be provided locally throughout Scotland.\\" A spokesman for NHS National Services Scotland said: \\"It is essential to have a service that can be properly staffed and resourced that can provide a high quality, resilient and sustainable service for the long term for NHS Scotland. \\"Specialist services like cleft lip and palate with a few complex operations a year often benefit from concentrating surgical skills in one place.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"Parents and the Cleft Lip and Palate Association (CLAPA) in Scotland have expressed anger over plans by the NHS to merge the country's two cleft lip and palate clinics into one facility in Glasgow.
