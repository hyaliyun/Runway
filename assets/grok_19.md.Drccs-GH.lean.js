Over the last 30 years, Bangkok, once a small fishing village, has transformed into a rich, concrete, high-rise city that it is today. The spreading metropolis and its population of 12 million now produces 35 per cent of Thailand's economic wealth. As a magnet for foreign companies, Bangkok attracts many overseas managers and business people from different fields, including tourism, automobiles and electronics. The city's population of foreigners is in the high hundreds of thousands, with tens of thousands of Japanese, Chinese and western employees working alongside hundreds of thousands of Burmese who mostly do unskilled jobs shunned by Thais. For those used to the good life, the variety and quality of the city's food is a key attraction, says one US manager, before listing many of his favourite Italian, Mexican and, of course, Thai restaurants. Most offer quality meals for less than the cost of a takeaway sandwich in London. Great choice and value can be found in Bangkok's other attractions, too. For overseas business people who enjoy shopping in luxury and air-conditioned comfort, the city has hundreds of modern shopping malls. Some foreigners, however, prefer the charms of Chatuchak Market, where anything can be bought at a good price by the skilled bargainer. When the time comes to talk business many overseas business people prefer to move out of the markets and onto the golf course. Thailand has thousands of courses, which can provide a welcome break from the busy and noisy city life. But most business people go to the golf course because it's the perfect place to discuss the next big deal. Because of the fast-paced life some foreign business people see Bangkok as a place to stay for the short term, rather than a lifetime. Australian computer software designer Sarah Huang is seven months pregnant but still working full-time in her Bangkok office. She says the city is \\"definitely a place I want to stay for the next five, ten years\\". Nannies and home help are affordable, but high fees for quality...

Washington (CNN) -- A trio of congressional Republicans passionately appealed to the Pentagon on Thursday to drop charges against three Navy SEALs accused of assaulting an Iraqi suspected of orchestrating the 2004 killing and mutilation of four U.S. contractors.  Flanked by about a dozen retired Navy SEALs at a news conference near the Capitol, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-California; Rep. Dan Burton, R-Indiana; and Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, insisted that the U.S. is sending the wrong message to its troops.  \\"These Navy SEALs were apprehending a terrorist murderer, and they are being accused of roughing him up? Give me a break! These men should be given medals, not prosecuted. These men are heroes,\\" Rohrabacher said.  Burton agreed, saying, \\"These people are laying their lives on the line every day, and they can't go into a combat situation with kid gloves on.\\"  The congressmen said they plan to present to Pentagon officials petitions signed by thousands of people supporting the SEALs.  The Iraqi suspect, Ahmed Hashim Abed, complained to investigators he was punched during his detention.  One of the three SEALs, Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe, 24, accused of assault, stood next to his attorney at the event Thursday. McCabe did not speak.  Gohmert said those who bring harm to Americans should not get the same judicial treatment as U.S. citizens.  \\"They get all their constitutional rights.

Versions of revived Palladian architecture dominated English country house architecture. Houses were increasingly placed in grand landscaped settings, and large houses were generally made wide and relatively shallow, largely to look more impressive from a distance. The height was usually highest in the centre, and the Baroque emphasis on corner pavilions often found on the continent generally avoided. In grand houses, an entrance hall led to steps up to a piano nobile or mezzanine floor where the main reception rooms were. Typically the basement area or \\"rustic\\", with kitchens, offices and service areas, as well as male guests with muddy boots, came some way above ground, and was lit by windows that were high on the inside, but just above ground level outside. A single block was typical, with a perhaps a small court for carriages at the front marked off by railings and a gate, but rarely a stone gatehouse, or side wings around the court.

Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

Context: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

The awards, held annually, recognize and celebrate the exceptional talent that exists within the British and Irish songwriting and composing community. This year's event, which took place on September 19th, 2021, saw Black Sabbath being honored for their contribution to the world of rock and heavy metal music over their extensive career, which spans more than five decades. Formed in Birmingham, England, in 1968, Black Sabbath is considered one of the pioneering bands of heavy metal music, with a legacy that has influenced countless artists and bands. The original lineup consisted of vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, and drummer Bill Ward. Despite several lineup changes over the years, the band has remained at the forefront of the heavy metal genre, releasing 19 studio albums in total, with their final one, titled '13,' released in 2013. The Ivor Novello Awards, established in 1955, are named after the popular Welsh composer, singer, and actor Ivor Novello. They are presented annually by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors (BASCA) and are considered one of the most esteemed accolades in the world of music. The awards recognize excellence in music writing and serve as an acknowledgment of the immense hard work, dedication, and passion that artists put in while creating their compositions. The lifetime achievement award, in particular, highlights the contributions of an artist or band to the world of music over an extended period. Over the years, Black Sabbath has been credited with inspiring and influencing an entire generation of musicians and bands, including Metallica, Nirvana, and Iron Maiden, to name a few. Their unique sound has attracted millions of fans worldwide, earning them a prominent position in the history of rock music. The band has sold over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists in history. Black Sabbath's musical style is often characterized by dark lyrics, down-tuned guitars, powerful riffs, and a fusion of blues, rock, and heavy metal. Their iconic songs such as \\"Paranoid,\\" \\"Iron Man,\\" and \\"War Pigs\\" have become absolute classics in the world of rock and metal, with their influence still felt in contemporary music today. The members of Black Sabbath have expressed their gratitude for receiving the lifetime achievement award, acknowledging the hard work, perseverance, and camaraderie that have kept the band going for more than 50 years. In a statement, guitarist Tony Iommi said, \\"We're honored to receive the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement. It's a recognition of a lifetime's worth of passion, work, and devotion. We'd like to thank all our fans who supported us through the years and helped us create some of the most memorable music in rock history.\\" In conclusion, Black Sabbath's lifetime achievement award at the Ivor Novello songwriting awards ceremony is a fitting testament to the band's remarkable influence and impact on the world of heavy metal and rock music. As the band members accept this prestigious accolade, they continue to serve as an inspiration to current and future generations of musicians and remind us all of the power that music has in connecting people, transcending boundaries, and leaving an indelible mark on history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A recent report  from Fuzhou Daily says about 18% of Fuzhou teenagers  can have problems with their minds(,).Some students become worried because they have to study very hard. Others have trouble getting on well with people like their parents and classmates. Zhang Qiong, a junior 2 student from Fuzhou, could not understand his teachers in class and was doing badly in his lessons. He was afraid of exams. When he looked at the exam paper, he couldn't think of anything to write. Another student, a15-year-old girl called Wu Yuan from Xiamen often argued ( ) with herclassmates even her parents because of some difficult ideas. She became so angry with them that she started to cut her finger with a knife. However, many students who have problems won't go for advice or help. Some think they will look stupid if they go to see a doctor.  Others don't want to talk about their secrets. here is some advice for the teenagers to solve the problems: Firstly, talk to your parents or teachers often. Secondly, take part in group activities and do sports. Thirdly, go to see a doctor if you feel unhappy or unwell. Question: Why won't the students who have problems go for advice or help?

On April 18, 1985, a few months after taking his Senate seat, Kerry and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa traveled to Nicaragua and met the country's president, Daniel Ortega. Though Ortega had won internationally certified elections, the trip was criticized because Ortega and his leftist Sandinista government had strong ties to Cuba and the USSR and were accused of human rights abuses. The Sandinista government was opposed by the right-wing CIA-backed rebels known as the Contras. While in Nicaragua, Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict. Through the senators, Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S. dropping support of the Contras. The offer was denounced by the Reagan administration as a \\"propaganda initiative\\" designed to influence a House vote on a 14 million Contra aid package, but Kerry said \\"I am willing..... to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas.\\" The House voted down the Contra aid, but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a 200 million loan the next day, which in part prompted the House to pass a larger 27 million aid package six weeks later.

You are given a new situation: Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture.  and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Please answer this question : Which farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water? A:","output":"To determine which farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water, we need to consider their agricultural methods. Step 1: Review the agricultural methods of both farms - Bold farm used lots of fertilizers. - Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture. Step 2: Understand the hint provided - Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. - Runoff carries dissolved fertilizers, including nitrogen, into bodies of water. - High nitrogen levels in water cause excessive algae growth. - Algae consume oxygen, leading to a dead zone. Step 3: Identify the key differences in farming methods - Bold farm relied heavily on fertilizers, including nitrogen-based ones, that can contribute to dead zones in bodies of water. - Shallow farm used organic and permaculture methods, which avoid or limit the use of chemical fertilizers and instead focus on natural ways to nurture plant growth. Step 4: Compare the potential impact on bodies of water - Bold farm's use of fertilizers means higher nitrogen levels can be washed away into bodies of water, encouraging algae growth and contributing to dead zones. - Shallow farm's organic and permaculture methods reduce the likelihood of nitrogen-based fertilizers entering bodies of water, thus minimizing the risk of dead zones. Conclusion: Shallow farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water due to their organic and permaculture methods that avoid or limit the use of chemical fertilizers. So, the answer is A: Shallow farm."},{"instruction":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"I like it app\\" A:","output":"3"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Bodmin is a civil parish and major town in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated south-west of Bodmin Moor.  - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around  43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century.  - A conurbation is a region comprising a number of cities, large towns, and other urban areas that, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan.  - Truro is a city and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Truro is Cornwall's county town and only city, its centre for administration, leisure and retail and had a population recorded in the 2011 census of 18,766. It is the most southern city in mainland Great Britain. People from Truro are known as Truronians.   - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million.  - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - Camborne ('Crooked Hill') is a town and civil parish in west Cornwall, UK. It is at the western edge of a conurbation comprising Camborne, Pool and Redruth.  - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - Cornwall is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom. It is bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea, to the south by the English Channel, and to the east by the county of Devon, over the River Tamar. Cornwall has a population of and covers an area of . The administrative centre, and only city in Cornwall, is Truro, although the town of Falmouth has the largest population for a civil parish and the conurbation of Camborne, Pool and Redruth has the highest total population.  - Bodmin Moor is a granite moorland in northeastern Cornwall, England. It is in size, and dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history. It includes Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall, and Rough Tor, a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the Bronze Age culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated.  - The Tamar is a river in south west England, that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). The area is a World Heritage Site due to its historic mining activities.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).   - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A watchmaker is an artisan who makes and repairs watches. Since a majority of watches are now factory made, most modern watchmakers only repair watches. However, originally they were master craftsmen who built watches, including all their parts, by hand. Modern watchmakers, when required to repair older watches, for which replacement parts may not be available, must have fabrication skills, and can typically manufacture replacements for many of the parts found in a watch. The term clockmaker refers to an equivalent occupation specializing in clocks.  - John Arnold ( born 1736 probably in Bodmin , Cornwall -- died 1799 in London ) was an English watchmaker and inventor . John Arnold was the first to design a watch that was both practical and accurate , and also brought the term \`\` Chronometer '' into use in its modern sense , meaning a precision timekeeper . His technical advances enabled the quantity production of Marine Chronometers for use on board ships from around 1782 . The basic design of these , with a few modifications unchanged until the late twentieth century . With regard to his legacy one can say that both he and Abraham - Louis Breguet largely invented the modern mechanical watch . Certainly one of his most important inventions , the Overcoil balance spring is still to be found in most mechanical wrist watches to this day . It is necessary to point out that the brand name Arnold & Son used by a Swiss watch company has absolutely no connection to the original firm founded by John Arnold . It was from around 1770 that Arnold developed the portable precision timekeeper , almost from the point where John Harrison ended his work in this field . But compared to Harrison 's complicated and expensive watch , Arnold 's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable . Importantly , the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity at a reasonable price whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment . But three elements were necessary for this achievement : A detached escapement , which gave minimal interference with the vibrating balance and balance spring A balance design that enabled compensation for the effect of temperature on the balance spring A method for adjusting the balance spring , so that the balance oscillates in equal time periods , even through different degrees of balance arc  - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.  - A clockmaker is an artisan who makes and/or repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be employed by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery.  - Redruth is a town and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The population of Redruth was 14,018 at the 2011 census. In the same year the population of the Camborne-Redruth urban area, which also includes Carn Brea, Illogan and several satellite villages, stood at 55,400 making it the largest conurbation in Cornwall. Redruth lies approximately at the junction of the A393 and A3047 roads, on the route of the old London to Land's End trunk road (now the A30), and is approximately west of Truro, east of St Ives, north east of Penzance and north west of Falmouth. Camborne and Redruth together form the largest urban area in Cornwall and before local government reorganisation were an urban district.  - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone.   - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.

Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors.  and a hint : New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  Please answer this question : Would darker squirrels have greater or smaller chance of survival than lighter squirrels? A:","output":"In the specific context of Mike's cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction, darker squirrels may potentially have a greater chance of survival than lighter squirrels. This outcome can be attributed to several factors related to their coat color and the challenges posed by the cold environment, all of which are intricately connected with the process of natural selection. Firstly, it is important to consider the role coat color plays in heat absorption and retention. Darker coats are generally more effective at absorbing and retaining heat from sunlight, which can be advantageous in a cold environment. This means that darker squirrels might be better able to maintain their body temperature and expend less energy trying to stay warm. As a result, natural selection would favor darker-coated squirrels in this context, as their increased energy efficiency could ultimately translate to greater survival and reproductive success. Another aspect to consider is the potential effect of coat coloration on camouflage and predator evasion. In environments with less predator-prey interaction like the city, it is possible that lighter coat colors don't pose as significant of a survival disadvantage to squirrels. However, the darker coat color might still offer some level of camouflage in certain situations, particularly in areas with ample shadows or darker foliage commonly found in urban environments. Over time, natural selection might have favored a fraction of the squirrel population to develop darker coats to better blend into the surroundings and avoid detection by potential predators. It is important to note that the relationship between an organism's traits and their survival and reproduction success can be complex, with numerous variables at play. Additionally, genetic variation might contribute to the persistence of lighter coat colors within the squirrel population even if darker coats have a modest survival advantage under these specific conditions. To sum up, considering Mike's cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction, darker squirrels might have a greater chance of survival due to their improved heat absorption and retention, as well as the potential camouflage benefit. Natural selection would likely favor these traits, resulting in the proliferation of beneficial heritable traits that increase the chances of survival and reproduction for darker-coated squirrels. However, it is crucial to recognize the complexity of the relationship between traits, environments, and natural selection, with many factors potentially influencing the coat color variation observed in squirrel populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which person had fewer problems with mental abilities?  Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion.  Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. Answer:","output":"Rob had fewer problems with mental abilities in this scenario. The paragraph describes the unfortunate accident that occurred while Tammy and Rob were riding a tandem bike down a hill. They hit a large rock and fell, causing both of them to sustain brain injuries. Tammy's brain injury was severe, as she ended up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. The paragraph states that serious brain injuries usually result from an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or a jolt to the head or body. They can also be caused by an object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull. As a consequence of her serious injury, it can be inferred that Tammy might have problems with talking, controlling body movements, personality changes, and with mental abilities such as memory. Rob, on the other hand, suffered only a mild concussion as a result of the accident. Mild concussions are generally less severe than serious brain injuries and often have temporary symptoms that usually resolve without permanent consequences. People with mild concussions may experience headaches, dizziness, confusion, or temporary memory problems, but these typically improve with time. Given the differences in the severity of their brain injuries, it is clear that Rob had fewer problems with mental abilities compared to Tammy. Tammy's serious brain injury likely resulted in more significant cognitive impairments and potential long-term disabilities, whereas Rob's mild concussion likely caused temporary and less severe issues. While treatments such as medicines, counseling, and other interventions might help individuals like Tammy recover or cope with their disabilities, it is evident that Rob faced fewer problems with mental abilities in this situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Each new naval air base consists of an HQ, support units and one or more aviation groups/wings . In a second stage, the air bases were merged into territorially integrated structures. Only the 279th Regiment retained its status. The planned transfer of Naval Aviation assets  to the Air Force has been delayed  due to their importance to the service, but was finally implemented by the end of 2011. As of 2012, the only fixed wing strike and fighter aircraft of Russian Naval Aviation are the Su-33 fighters and Su-25UTG attack aircraft of the 279th Regiment , plus the Su-24 bombers based in the Crimea.

Help as much as you can. The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why do people lead frenetic lifestyles?

Mayor Boris Johnson Monday outlined plans to make London \\"the cleanest, greenest city on Earth\\" by the 2012 Olympics and called for commitments from other world cities at a climate change conference, leaders of the world' s 40 largest cities are meeting in Seoul this week for a summit on combating global warming -- the third to be held since 2005.     \\"What we should do in Seoul is agree that we will stop the endless addiction of mankind to the internal combustion engine  ,\\" said Johnson. He said at a press conference the world's cities consume 75 percent of the world's energy and produce 80 percent of the emissions which cause climate change. \\"The problem of our planet is an urban problem,\\" Johnson said.     He said the British capital wants to use the Olympics \\"to drive the greening and the improvement of our city\\" and noted that London is committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 percent by 2025.     Johnson said the key measure was being taken to solve problems relating to housing and commercial buildings, which accounted for 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in London. This involved retrofitting  -- installing lagging -- in large numbers of public buildings.     Johnson proclaimed himself a \\"passionate cyclist\\" and said he would push ahead with cycle superhighways around London.     London's air quality problem, he said, was caused by vehicle emissions from 8,300 worn and used diesel  buses, which could be replaced by low-carbon vehicles. In addition, there were also 32,000 taxis running on diesel fuel, which could be replaced by electric vehicles.     Johnson said there would be a few programs in the next few years to produce a \\"cleaner, greener\\" bus for the city. \\"The age of the diesel bus has got to be over in London.\\" Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE according to this passage? A) London's air quality will be improved in the near future. B) The used buses running on diesel will be replaced by electric vehicles.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: The car hit a post, but the driver didn't stop.  He did what? Possible A: seatbelt, suffer damage, gain speed, slow down, rush away  Why is \\"rush away\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Rush away\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, which involve understanding human behavior, emotions, and logic in such a situation. 1. Fear of consequences: When a car hits a post, the driver might be afraid of potential legal and financial repercussions of the accident. Rushing away can be seen as an attempt to escape the responsibility of the incident and minimize the consequences they would face. 2. Panic or confusion: In the aftermath of an accident, a driver may experience a sudden surge of adrenaline and panic, which could cause them to act impulsively and erratically. As a result of this emotional reaction, they might drive away from the scene hastily (\\"rush away\\") without giving much thought to their actions. 3. Protecting oneself: The driver may have a valid concern that stopping could potentially put them in a risky or dangerous situation. For example, they could be in an unsafe neighborhood or fear confrontation with witnesses. In this case, rushing away might be a self-preservation tactic. 4. Guilt or shame: The driver might not want to face the embarrassment of admitting their mistake to others, including any passengers in their vehicle or bystanders at the scene. Rushing away could be their way of avoiding an uncomfortable situation and preserving their pride. 5. Habitual behavior or history: If the driver has a history of hit-and-run incidents or a general tendency to avoid responsibility, then rushing away would be consistent with their past behavior. Comparing \\"rush away\\" with the other options provided: - Seatbelt: This option doesn't fit the context of the question since it doesn't describe the driver's response to the accident. - Suffer damage: Although it might be true that the car has suffered damage, this option does not answer the question about the driver's actions. - Gain speed and slow down: These options are also not aligned with common sense in explaining the driver's behavior in such a situation. It's unlikely that a driver would simply gain speed or slow down without doing something more specific after an accident. In conclusion, \\"rush away\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it describes a plausible driver's reaction to a car accident based on factors like fear, panic, self-preservation, and guilt, which are common emotions and motives that humans can generally understand and relate to. The other options provided do not address the driver's actions as directly or adequately as \\"rush away\\" does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit  . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy   in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy  , a trend called \\"age compression  \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade. Action figures, for instance, used to be considered healthy for boys up to age 12. Now the items are mainly marketed to boys 4 to 6. A recent study found that...

DuJuan Harris fumbled at the one-yard line Saturday in a 31-24 win over the Broncos. Lose ball, lose job? 49ers RBs focused on ball security How does it feel when a would-be touchdown becomes a turnover? Unfortunately for DuJuan Harris, he can provide the answer. On Saturday, the 49ers running back appeared poised to finish off a 12-yard scoring run … before he fumbled at the one-yard line when smacked by two Denver defenders. Harris fell into the end zone and loose ball fell in the hands of cornerback John Tidwell. “It just shows life can change real quick,” Harris said. “Things could have been going really well and it turned for the worse.” Harris’ fumble was the most gut-wrenching, but it wasn’t unique. The 49ers have lost five fumbles in two preseason games and their running backs have been the primary culprits. Mike Davis lost two fumbles Saturday, Carlos Hyde had a fumble returned for a touchdown in the preseason opener and Harris was involved in a botched handoff on 1st-and-goal at the 2 in the first exhibition game. Head coach Chip Kelly said the situation “has to be rectified.” “I think (running backs coach) Tom Rathman does a tremendous job with our backs, but a little responsibility goes to them,” Kelly said. “He talks about it all the time. We have to be able to know that when you’re in the game, we can give you the ball, and you’re going to come back to the huddle with it.” Another fumble could be dire for Harris or Davis, who might be fighting for a roster spot if the 49ers only keep one other running back after Hyde and Shaun Draughn. “It’s hard to win a game in this league and turnovers make it even harder,” Harris said. “So it’s something that they’re going to stay on us about.” Offensive coordinator Curtis Modkins, 45, an all-conference running back at TCU, was asked this week about any helpful ball-security tips he received during his playing days. Modkins recalled he once lost two fumbles against Arkansas, turnovers that keyed the Razorbacks’ come-from-behind win. My coaches “told me if I did it again I’d never play again,” Modkins said. “So that was my tip.” QB quartet: With Colin Kaepernick expected to play, the 49ers will have four quarterbacks available for the first time in the preseason. Kelly was asked if Kaepernick, Blaine Gabbert, Christian Ponder and rookie Jeff Driskel would all receive playing time against the Packers on Friday night. “If anybody is up and healthy and we have to make an evaluation of them, we want to play them in a game,” Kelly said.

Mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt (asphalt concrete) in that it has a higher asphalt/bitumen (binder) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% added asphalt/bitumen. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of 210 °C (410 °F) and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 millimeters (0.79 inches) thick.

Question: How does Carol decide they should take their own lives? Movie title: Testament Movie plot: The Wetherly familyâhusband Tom (William Devane), wife Carol (Jane Alexander), and children Brad (Ross Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas) -- live in the fictional suburb of Hamelin, California, within a 90-minute drive of San Francisco, where Tom works. On a routine afternoon, Carol (a stay-at-home mom and volunteer for school functions such as directing the school play) listens to an answering-machine message from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it. Suddenly, the blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is then seen through the window. The family huddles on the floor in panic as the town's air-raid sirens go off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are running around on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family hopes Tom will return, but the circumstances are hard to ignore.

The sentence further tells a story about the figures of Moses and Aaron going to meet Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt. According to the narration, their actions are following the commandments of Yahweh, a term used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to God. The next part of the text refers to a miraculous event - Aaron, Moses's brother, throws down his rod in the presence of Pharaoh and his servants, and it transforms into a serpent. This event is a popular story in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, where Aaron's rod turning into a serpent was one of the signs God gave Moses to convince Pharaoh to let the Israelites go (Exodus 4:2–4, Exodus 7:8–13). In this biblical narrative, the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, and Moses, under God's command, sought their liberation from Pharaoh.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.  - Professional wrestling is a dramatized athletic performance inspired by competitive combat sports. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content  including match outcomes  is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret. The presentation of scripted events as legitimate is known as \\"kayfabe\\".  - Jerry W. Jarrett Sr. (born September 4, 1942 in Nashville, Tennessee) is an American promoter and former professional wrestler, and the father of wrestler Jeff Jarrett. He is the co-founder and former part-owner of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Like World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon, Jarrett was initially a promoter and became a wrestler later in life.  - The American Wrestling Association (AWA) was an American professional wrestling promotion based in Minneapolis, Minnesota that ran from 1960 to 1991. It was owned and founded by Verne Gagne and Wally Karbo. The territory was originally part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), becoming an independent territory in the late 1950s.  - In general, spectacle refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in Middle English from c. 1340 as \\"specially prepared or arranged display\\" it was borrowed from Old French \\"spectacle\\", itself a reflection of the Latin \\"spectaculum\\" \\"a show\\" from \\"spectare\\" \\"to view, watch\\" frequentative form of \\"specere\\" \\"to look at.\\" The word \\"spectacle\\" has also been a term of art in theater dating from the 17th century in English drama.  - Lord Humongous is a professional wrestling character also known as a \`\` gimmick '' that was originally introduced in Memphis ' Continental Wrestling Association ( CWA ) in 1984 . The character was based on a gang leader called \`\` the Humungus '' or at times \`\` Lord Humungus '' from the 1981 movie Mad Max 2 : The Road Warrior . The original Lord Humongous was portrayed by Mike Stark , who was tall and physically impressive like the character in the movie . Since Lord Humongous always wears a Hockey mask it allowed promoters to replace the man under the mask without having to publicly acknowledge that it was someone else playing the part . The character became a recurring gimmick on the CWA but was also used in other promotions after the CWA closed . The character has been played by a number of wrestlers including Jeff Van Kamp , Sid Vicious and Barry Buchanan and Sid 's son Gunnar Eudy .  - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring.  - The United States Wrestling Association or USWA was a professional wrestling promotion based in Memphis, Tennessee. The company was founded when the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association merged with the Dallas-based World Class Wrestling Association.  - The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) is a professional wrestling governing body which has historically been the largest league of independent wrestling promotions in the world. The organization sanctions various NWA championship bouts within its member promotions. The NWA has been in operation since 1948. Prior to the 1960s, it acted as the sole governing body for most of professional wrestling, operating as a talent and brand name franchiser for the inter-regional \\"territory\\" system.  - Continental Wrestling Association (later on Championship Wrestling Association) was a wrestling promotion managed by Jerry Jarrett. The CWA was the name of the \\"governing body\\" for the Championship Wrestling, Inc. promotion which was usually referred to as Mid-Southern Wrestling or the Memphis territory. This promotion was a chief NWA territory during the 1970s and early 1980s while operating out of Tennessee and Kentucky. The CWA was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance until 1986 and affiliated with the American Wrestling Association until 1989. In 1989, the CWA merged with the World Class Wrestling Association to form the United States Wrestling Association thus ceasing to exist as a separate entity.  - In professional wrestling, kayfabe is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as \\"real\\" or \\"true,\\" specifically the portrayal of competition, rivalries, and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or pre-determined nature of any kind. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this \\"reality\\" within the direct or indirect presence of the general public. Though the staged nature of professional wrestling had been a frequent topic of conversation among the media and public since at least the latter years of the early 20th century, the professional wrestling industry did not formally acknowledge this until changes in the business during the 1980s professional wrestling boom prompted attitudes within the business to change. In 1989, World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon testified before the New Jersey state senate that wrestling was staged. Long sanctioned by New Jersey and other states as an athletic exhibition for regulation and taxation purposes, McMahon sought to eliminate oversight, and hence taxation, on the WWF's house shows and pay-per-view events held within the state.  - Jeff VanCamp, Sr. is an American retired professional wrestler, who wrestled under the ring names Jeff Van Kamp/Jeff Van Camp as well as working as Lord Humongous in 1984 and 1985. He is a former NWA Alabama Heavyweight Champion and NWA Southeast Continental Heavyweight Champion.  - Catch wrestling is a classical hybrid grappling style that was developed in Britain circa 1870 by J. G. Chambers, then later refined and popularised by the wrestlers of travelling funfairs who developed their own submission holds, or \\"hooks\\", into their wrestling to increase their effectiveness against their opponents. Catch wrestling derives from a number of different styles, the English styles of Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling, Cornwall and Devon wrestling, Lancashire wrestling, Irish collar-and-elbow wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, styles of the Indian subcontinent such as Pehlwani, Jujutsu and Iranian styles such as Varzesh-e Pahlavani. The training of some modern submission wrestlers, professional wrestlers and mixed martial artists is founded in catch wrestling.  - A combat sport, or fighting sport, is a competitive contact sport with one-on-one combat. Determining the winner depends on the particular contest's rules. In many fighting sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Sambo, and Mixed Martial Arts are examples of combat sports.  - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.

Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

The style began around 1600 in Rome and Italy, and spread to most of Europe.  - Respect is a feeling of admiration or deference toward a person, child, non-human animal, group, ideal, or indeed almost any entity or concept, as well as specific actions and conduct representative of that esteem. Respect can be a specific feeling of regard for the actual qualities of the one respected (e.g., \\"I have great respect for her judgment\\"). It can also be conduct in accord with a specific ethic of respect.  - Comedy Central is an American basic cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. The channel carries comedy programming, in the form of both original and syndicated series and stand-up comedy specials, as well as feature films.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - A correctional facility, detention center, gaol (Australia, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, UK), jail (US, Canada), penitentiary, prison, or remand centre is a facility in which inmates are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as a form of punishment after being convicted of crimes. Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until they are brought to trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. Besides their use for punishing civil crimes, jails and prisons are frequently used by authoritarian regimes.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Michael Showalter (born June 17, 1970) is an American comedian, actor, producer, writer, and director. He is a member of the sketch comedy trio Stella. Showalter first came to recognition as a cast member on MTV's \\"The State\\", which aired from 1993 to 1995. He co-wrote (with David Wain) and starred in \\"Wet Hot American Summer\\" (2001) and he wrote, directed, and starred in \\"The Baxter\\" (2005), with Michelle Williams, Justin Theroux and Elizabeth Banks. Both of these movies featured many of his co-stars from \\"The State\\", and so do several of his other projects.  - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

The channel was initially broadcast over-the-air in selected markets, where the former all-request music channel known as The Box was broadcast. The channel was originally launched as a constant commercial-free music video channel, much like the original MTV channel; but once MTV started to change its focus from music to reality television in the 2000s, MTV2's focus changed as well, thus bringing music video programming away from both MTV and MTV2. Today, MTV2 broadcasts unscripted programming and syndicated television episodes from MTV and other networks.  - Adult Swim is a programming block of the American cable network Cartoon Network that operates at night from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., Eastern and Pacific Time.

Supremacy Clause The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under its authority, constitute the supreme law of the land. It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied. Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law. In essence, it is a conflict-of-laws rule specifying that certain federal acts take priority over any state acts that conflict with federal law. In this respect, the Supremacy Clause follows the lead of Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, which provided that \`\`Every State shall abide by the determination of the United States in Congress Assembled, on all questions which by this confederation are submitted to them.'' A constitutional provision announcing the supremacy of federal law, the Supremacy Clause assumes the underlying priority of federal authority, at least when that authority is expressed in the Constitution itself. No matter what the federal government or the states might wish to do, they have to stay within the boundaries of the Constitution. This makes the Supremacy Clause the cornerstone of the whole American political structure. Is this statement correct \\"do supreme court rulings apply to all states\\"?","output":"Yes, this statement is correct. Supreme Court rulings apply to all states because they interpret and establish the meaning of the United States Constitution, federal laws, and treaties, which are considered the supreme law of the land under the Supremacy Clause. The Supremacy Clause ensures that federal law, including Supreme Court decisions, takes precedence over state laws and constitutions when there is a conflict. This means that when the Supreme Court makes a ruling on a constitutional issue or federal law, that ruling becomes binding on all states and their courts. State governments and courts must then follow and apply the Supreme Court's interpretation in their actions and decisions. For example, when the Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, the decision was binding on all states. As a result, state governments and public schools across the country were required to desegregate and remove any racial barriers in education. In some cases, the Supreme Court's rulings have a broader impact by establishing legal principles that apply to a wide range of situations. These principles guide lower federal courts and state courts when they interpret the Constitution and federal laws in their own cases. This \\"vertical\\" relationship between the Supreme Court and the state courts ensures that the Constitution and federal laws are applied uniformly across the country, upholding the ideal of a single, unified system of law in the United States. In summary, the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution ensures that Supreme Court rulings apply to all states, establishing the primacy of federal law and the uniform application of the Constitution and federal laws throughout the country. This reinforces the fundamental principle that the United States is a single nation governed by a supreme law, which applies to all citizens and institutions, regardless of their state or jurisdiction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Guinea fowls are a group of birds belong to the Numididae family, with their origin dating back millions of years. They have been an essential part of the natural ecosystem and human societies for a long time. The statement highlights that the guinea fowl has its evolutionary roots in the southern region of the African continent. More specifically, the helmeted guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), which is widely known and kept as a domesticated poultry bird, is a species primarily native to Africa. The African continent is extremely diverse and rich in wildlife, providing ideal habitats and conditions for the guinea fowl and its evolutionary development. Over time, guinea fowls have adapted to a variety of environments within the continent, ranging from savannahs, grasslands, and forests, to semi-arid and arid regions. This adaptation and their ability to thrive in various environments make them an integral part of the African ecosystem. Additionally, their domestication and use as a poultry bird have contributed significantly to their popularity and distribution outside of Africa. Throughout their development and evolution, guinea fowls have played essential roles in human societies, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. They have been an important source of protein, feathers, and even as a form of pest control. The spread of guinea fowl across the African continent and beyond can also be attributed to their adaptable nature, making them popular among farmers and other poultry keepers. In conclusion, the statement \\"Guinea fowl originated in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris)\\" does indeed contain the answer to the question about the continent where the guinea fowl is credited with its evolutionary origins, which is Africa. This continent is known for its rich biodiversity and unique wildlife, providing the perfect environment for the development and evolution of the guinea fowl species over millions of years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Invention workshops will guide you through the basics of coming up with an idea, building it, and then telling other people about why your idea is important and useful. There are young inventor workshops all over the world that you can sign-up for and participate in. There are also camps available for young inventors that might be of interest. In most cases a simple name describing the function of your invention is sufficient, but a catchy name can also help people remember your product. Keep the name short and to-the-point. Avoid using a confusing or misleading name. Come up with a few different names and ask your friends and family what sounds the best. In order to protect your invention and claim it as your own, you must patent it. A patent is a legal document stating that you came up with the idea and proves that you own the invention. It prevents other people from stealing your idea. The patent process can be complicated so ask your parents for help with this if it’s something you are seriously considering. If you want to mass produce your invention and start selling it to others, you will likely need to raise some money. Investors are individuals who give you money when you are first starting out so you can produce the product. In return, they will get some of the profits from the sales of product.  You can start by asking friends and family to help out. Participating in inventor challenges can be a great start because many of them have cash prizes.

Options: - call the police - doing drugs - new contacts - making new friends - plan  Explain why a human would choose \\"doing drugs\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human might choose \\"doing drugs\\" as the answer to the question because of the following reasons: 1. Setting: Since the party is taking place in an alley, it doesn't seem like a conventional or safe environment for a gathering. Alleys are often associated with illicit activities or dangerous behaviors, especially in popular media. 2. Stereotype: The location carries a certain stigma that could lead people to believe this party involves illegal or questionable behavior. People may assume that drug use is more likely to occur in such an environment, again based on stereotypes and media portrayals. 3. Concealment: An alley provides a relatively secluded area for individuals looking to engage in illegal activities or avoid drawing attention to themselves. This supports the notion that people attending a party in an alley might be more likely to do drugs. 4. Less supervision: Since the party is not taking place in a more public or organized venue, there might be a lack of formal supervision or safety measures. Due to this, individuals may feel a greater sense of freedom to engage in illegal or risky activities, including doing drugs.

Let's solve the math problem step by step like we're telling a story to make it easy for you to understand. We have the equation: 0 = -28*k - 43456 + 43904 First, let's combine those big numbers. We have -43456 and we want to add 43904. Imagine you have 43456 candies taken away (that's why it's a negative number) and then you receive 43904 candies. You end up with 43904 - 43456, which equals 448. Our equation now looks like this: 0 = -28*k + 448 Now, let's get k all by itself! We need to get rid of the 448 next to it. Since it's a positive number (meaning you have 448 candies), we will take away those candies to make it even. So we need to subtract 448 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 448 = -28*k + 448 - 448 This becomes: -448 = -28*k Now, we need to find out how many times -28 can fit into -448. It's like asking, \\"if we have -448 candies and each group has -28 candies, how many groups can we make?\\" To find that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -28: (-448) / (-28) = (-28*k) / (-28) This leaves us with: 16 = k So, k equals 16.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, KB (3 September 1724 - 10 November 1808), known between 1776 and 1786 as Sir Guy Carleton, was an Anglo-Irish soldier and administrator. He twice served as Governor of the Province of Quebec, from 1768 to 1778, concurrently serving as Governor General of British North America in that time, and again from 1785 to 1795. The title Baron Dorchester was created on 21 August 1786. He commanded British troops in the American War of Independence, first leading the defence of Quebec during the 1775 rebel invasion and the 1776 counteroffensive that drove the rebels from the province. Upon his return to England Carleton recommended the creation of a position of Governor General of all the provinces in British North America. Instead he was appointed \\"Governor-in-chief\\", with simultaneous appointments as governor of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and St. John's Island (present-day Prince Edward Island). He arrived in Quebec on 23 October 1786. His position as Governor-in-chief was mostly ignored. He found quickly that his authority in any of the provinces other than Quebec was effective only while he was present in person.  He was raised to the Peerage in August 1786 as Lord Dorchester, Baron of Dorchester in the County of Oxford.  The Constitutional Act of 1791 split the large territory of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada, corresponding roughly to areas settled by ethnic British and ethnic French, respectively. Sir Alured Clarke was named as the lieutenant governor of Lower Canada and John Graves Simcoe the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. In August 1791 Carleton left for Britain and on 7 February 1792 took his seat in the House of Lords. He left for Canada again on 18 August 1793 to resume his duties there. His replacement, Robert Prescott, arrived in May 1796. On 9 July 1796 Carleton sailed from Canada to Britain, never to return.  In retirement Carleton lived mostly at Greywell Hill, adjoining Nately Scures, in Hampshire. After about 1805 he moved to Stubbings House at Burchett's Green, near Maidenhead, in Berkshire. On 10 November 1808, he died suddenly at Stubbings. He was buried in the parish church of St Swithun's, Nately Scures. What did carleton do during the year","output":"1775 and who assisted him in the counteroffensive of 1776? During the year 1775, Guy Carleton, then known as Sir Guy Carleton, played a crucial role in the defense of Quebec in the American War of Independence. As an Anglo-Irish soldier and administrator, he served as the Governor of the Province of Quebec, leading British troops against the rebel invasion. In 1775, the American Revolutionary forces attempted to invade and capture Quebec. Carleton took charge of organizing the defense of the city, mobilizing local militia, and preparing the fortifications to repel the invading forces. During this time, he displayed exceptional leadership, rallying the local population and British soldiers to fiercely defend Quebec against the American onslaught. In the counteroffensive of 1776, Carleton led a successful campaign to drive the rebels out of the province. He was assisted by local militia, Indigenous allies, and British troops, including both regulars and newly raised regiments. The counteroffensive was marked by a series of operations that pushed back the American forces from Quebec and secured the province for the British. One key figure who played a significant role in assisting Carleton was Sir John Johnson, a Loyalist leader and British officer, who raised a regiment, the King's Royal Regiment of New York, to fight on the British side. Johnson's men, many of whom were Loyalist refugees from the Thirteen Colonies, provided a valuable addition to Carleton's forces and took part in the successful expulsion of rebel forces from the province. Additionally, Indigenous allies, including the powerful Iroquois Confederacy, played a critical role in supporting Carleton's efforts. Their knowledge of the territory, expertise in guerrilla warfare, and strong opposition to American encroachment aided Carleton's forces in achieving a decisive victory during the counteroffensive. Overall, during the events of 1775 and the counteroffensive in 1776, Guy Carleton's leadership and the support of Loyalist militia, British troops, and Indigenous allies were instrumental in successfully defending Quebec and repelling the American invasion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K. We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: The worker probably believes: Options:  A. not enough information  B. the writer is pushover  C. his tools are in the truck  D. he can fix this bulb quickly","output":"Based on the context provided, the worker probably believes: B. the writer is a pushover This is because the worker initially fixed the light bulb issue and then offered a free inspection of the electrical parts of the house. After inspecting, he went on to explain in great detail about the fuse box and wiring, even though the homeowner was getting restless. He then quoted an estimate of 10,000 for a problem that another qualified person later said did not exist. This indicates that the worker may have tried to take advantage of the writer, believing they might be easily convinced to accept the high-cost repair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Hypothesis: The men are golfing. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, given the premise, we can conclude the hypothesis. The premise provides a clear and specific description of the scenario, offering sufficient information to support the hypothesis. In the premise, we are presented with four men playing golf on the putting green of a hole on a sunny day. When breaking this down further, we understand that there are several elements that lead us to the hypothesized conclusion: 1. Four men: This detail establishes the number of individuals engaging in the activity, which is relevant to understanding the context of the hypothesis regarding the men being golfers. 2. Playing golf: This is the primary activity being carried out by the men, which directly aligns with the hypothesis stating that the men are golfing. 3. Putting green: The putting green is a specific area on a golf course, and it indicates that the men are indeed on a golf course. This element corroborates that the activity taking place is golfing, as the location is specific to the sport. 4. Of a hole: This detail provides further information about the specific location within the golf course, describing a particular hole that the men are playing. This component reinforces that they are not merely on a golf course but actively participating in the game by attempting to complete different holes of the course. 5. On a sunny day: The weather condition of a sunny day provides some context for the scenario. It implies that the conditions are ideal for outdoor activities, such as golfing. While this element is not directly related to the hypothesis, it adds an environmental factor to the scene, painting a clearer picture of the situation. Considering these five elements as part of the premise, the connection to the hypothesis appears evident. As the men are engaged in playing golf on a specific hole within a golf course on a sunny day, it is a safe and reasonable conclusion that the men are, in fact, golfing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the first name of the person who was last seen at an archaeological dig?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Two young American couples — Jeff and Amy, and Eric and Stacy — enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias, a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft.

Ida is introduced to the beautiful and strange girl Misty Falls (Erin Brown a.k.a. Misty Mundae), and is drawn to her. A mysterious package arrives for Ida one day, containing a large unidentifiable mantis-like insect. Landlady Lana Beasley is concerned with Ida's âpetsâ and the effect that may be laid upon her ten-year-old granddaughter Betty, who likes to disguise herself as a ladybug. Betty in turn looks up to Ida, much to Beasleyâs dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names âMickâ, and informs her friend Max of the creature. Meanwhile, âMickâ escapes from his tank and attacks Beasleyâs pet dog, consuming the animal. The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if they can watch a movie about âTexas Pixiesâ on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts. Misty is introduced to Betty and the apartment, though Ida keeps her away from the bedroom where all her insects are hidden. The two get closer until interrupted by Max.

Most small swallowed items, such as teeth, will easily pass through the digestive tract along with food because they are the size of a pill and too small to cause any blockage. However, it is possible that the tooth will become stuck somewhere in the digestive system and require medical attention. Go to a doctor if:  The tooth has not passed within 7 days. Vomiting occurs, especially with blood present. Symptoms such as pain in the belly or chest develop, coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. You have blood in the stools, especially black or tarry blood. It will probably take about 12 to 14 hours for the tooth to pass.  However, don’t be surprised if it shows up sooner, or later, than within those parameters. Nothing moves through your body quickly. You need to pass it through your digestive system and the more relaxed you are, the faster it will move along through your stomach, intestines, and colon. Corn kernels can stay largely intact as they pass through the bowels. When you start seeing corn in your stool, you’ll know it’s time to look for the tooth. These foods can help items move along through the digestive tract. If recommended by a doctor, you may consider using a laxative to aid in the recovery of the tooth. Make sure to take the right amount of the laxative to avoid overdosing. Overuse of laxatives can have serious effects and lead to dependency, loss of bone density, and a host of other problems causing dehydration followed by an increased heart rate and low blood pressure. When your stool is fairly loose and/or watery (because of the laxative), place a screen on the toilet to catch the tooth. Summary:","output":"If you swallow a small item like a tooth, it usually passes through your body without problems, but if you have certain symptoms or it takes too long, you might need a doctor's help and maybe even use a laxative carefully."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.  Which friend started taking statins for his disease?  Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. A:","output":"In the scenario mentioned, Ben and Andy both have high cholesterol levels. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy did not go to the doctor due to his carelessness. The friend who started taking statins for his disease is Ben, as he was prescribed the medication by a healthcare professional. Statins are a widely prescribed medication that helps lower high cholesterol levels in many individuals. These drugs inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, a critical component involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, which in turn leads to a decrease in blood cholesterol levels. Statins stimulate the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver, effectively increasing the catabolism of plasma LDL and removing cholesterol from the bloodstream. This process helps reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of cholesterol-filled plaques in the arteries. The effectiveness of statins is known to vary among individuals due to the genetic background and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence how each person responds to this medication. This variability in response can be explained and studied using pharmacogenomics, a field that combines pharmacology and genomics. Pharmacogenomics investigates the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics and aims to understand the genetic factors that contribute to individual differences in drug response. This can, in turn, help healthcare providers prescribe the most effective combination of medications based on an individual's genetic makeup. In the case of Ben and Andy, Ben is the one using statins to manage his high cholesterol levels under the supervision of a healthcare professional. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of these medications may vary for Ben due to his unique genetic makeup. Further understanding of pharmacogenomics may eventually enable doctors to tailor cholesterol-lowering treatments to each individual based on their specific genetic profile and produce better outcomes in managing high cholesterol levels and subsequently reducing the risks associated with atherosclerosis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hanson is an American pop rock band from Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States, formed by brothers Isaac (guitar, bass, piano, vocals), Taylor (keyboards, piano, guitar, drums, vocals), and Zac (drums, piano, guitar, vocals). Supporting members include Dimitrius Collins (keyboards, guitar), and Andrew Perusi (bass) who have toured and performed live with the band since 2007. They are best known for the 1997 hit song \\"MMMBop\\" from their debut album released through Mercury, Polygram, Middle of Nowhere, which earned three Grammy nominations. Despite the enormous commercial success of Middle of Nowhere, the band suffered from the merger that eliminated their label, Mercury Records . Middle of Nowhere was released in the US on May 6, 1997, selling 10 million copies worldwide. May 6 was declared 'Hanson Day' in Tulsa by Oklahoma's then-governor Frank Keating. Although 'Hanson Day' was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence, many Hanson fans all over the world still recognize May 6 as Hanson Day every year. Hanson's popularity exploded during the summer of 1997, and Mercury Records released Hanson's first documentary Tulsa, Tokyo, and the Middle of Nowhere and their Christmas album Snowed In in the wake of their success. Hanson also launched MOE (which stood for Middle of Everywhere), a fan club magazine that ran for 12 issues. After numerous unauthorized biographies of each of the brothers were published, Hanson turned to their close friend, Jarrod Gollihare of Admiral Twin, to write their authorized biography. Hanson: The Official Book reached number 9 on the New York Times Best Sellers List (nonfiction) on February 1, 1998. The band was nominated for three Grammy Awards in 1998: Record of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. During the summer of 1998, Hanson began a highly successful concert tour, the Albertane Tour. They performed a string of shows throughout stadiums and arenas in the US, targeting young audiences with a playful and energetic style. A live album, titled Live From Albertane, was released the following fall, as well as their second documentary The Road to Albertane.  In response to the demand for their earlier work, Hanson re-released MMMBop as 3 Car Garage, minus four tracks, in May 1998. To date, the tracks from Boomerang have not been re-released. Three tracks from Boomerang (\\"Boomerang\\", \\"More Than Anything\\", and \\"Rain (Falling Down)\\") and two of the remaining tracks from MMMBop (\\"Incredible\\" and \\"Baby (You're So Fine)\\") were released on the first MOE CD sent to fan club members.  During the Albertane Tour, Hanson wrote and demoed what would later become the songs for their second major studio album, This Time Around. During this time period, Mercury Records, the band's label, had been merged with Island Def Jam.

Which entity is this text about? Amy Winehouse was born in Chase Farm Hospital, in north London, to Jewish parents. Her father, Mitchell \\"Mitch\\" Winehouse, was a window panel installer and then a taxi driver; and her mother, Janis Winehouse (nee Seaton), was a pharmacist. Winehouse's ancestors were Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish immigrants to London. Amy had an older brother, Alex (born 1979), and the family lived in London's Southgate area, where she attended Osidge Primary School. In 2006, Winehouse admitted to punching a female fan in the face for criticising her having taken Blake Fielder-Civil as a husband. She then attacked her own spouse as he attempted to calm her down. In October 2007, Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were arrested in Bergen, Norway, for possession of seven grams of cannabis. The couple were later released and fined 3850 kroner (around PS350). Winehouse first appealed the fines, but later dropped the appeal.  On 26 April 2008, Winehouse was cautioned after she admitted to police she slapped a 38-year-old man in the face, a \\"common assault\\" offence, her first of two. She voluntarily turned herself in and was held overnight. Police said, at her arrival she was \\"in no fit state\\" to be interviewed. Ten days later, Winehouse was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs after a video of her apparently smoking crack cocaine was passed to the police in January, but was released on bail a few hours later because they could not confirm, from the video, what she was smoking. The Crown Prosecution Service considered charging her, but cleared her when it could not establish that the substance in the video was a controlled drug. Some members of Parliament reacted negatively. Two London residents were subsequently charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine and ecstasy to Winehouse. One of the pair was sentenced to two years in prison on 13 December 2008, while the other received a two-year community order.  On 5 March 2009, Winehouse was arrested and charged with common assault following a claim by Sharene Flash that Winehouse hit her in the eye at the September 2008 Prince's Trust charity ball. Winehouse's spokesperson announced the cancellation of the singer's US Coachella Festival appearance in light of the new legal issue, and Winehouse appeared in court on 17 March to enter her plea of not guilty. On 23 July, her trial began with prosecutor Lyall Thompson charging that Winehouse acted with \\"deliberate and unjustifiable violence\\" while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol or another substance. She testified that she did not punch Flash, but tried to push her away because she was scared of her; she cited her worry that Flash would sell her story to a tabloid, Flash's height advantage, and Flash's \\"rude\\" behaviour. On 24 July, District Judge Timothy Workman ruled that Winehouse was not guilty, citing the facts that all but two of the witnesses were intoxicated at the time of the incident and that medical evidence did not show \\"the sort of injury that often occurs when there is a forceful punch to the eye.\\"  On 19 December 2009, Winehouse was arrested for a third time on charges of common assault, plus another charge of public order offence after assaulting the front-of-house manager of the Milton Keynes Theatre after he asked her to move from her seat. Winehouse plead guilty to the charges and was given a conditional discharge.","output":"This text is about Amy Winehouse, a British singer-songwriter known for her powerful vocals and soulful style.

Can you fix that?","output":"Sure, by \\"fixing\\" this text, the user implies making appropriate parts of the sentence start with a capital letter. Specifically, the user may want to capitalize the first letter of the sentence and proper nouns (if there are any). \\"Blouses for Plus Size Girls - Page 2\\" Step-by-step process: 1. Capitalize the first letter of the sentence: \\"blouses\\" becomes \\"Blouses\\" 2. Recognize \\"plus size girls\\" as a common noun, not a proper noun. Therefore, it doesn't require capitalization just for grammatical purposes. However, in the context of titles and headers, every word (except for prepositions, articles, and conjunctions) usually starts with a capital letter. So, in keeping with this style, capitalize the first letters: \\"plus size girls\\" becomes \\"Plus Size Girls\\". 3. Recognize \\"page 2\\" as a common noun again not requiring capitalization for grammatical purposes. But since it's part of a title, \\"page\\" is capitalized to \\"Page\\". The number \\"2\\" doesn't change. 4. The dash between \\"Girls\\" and \\"Page\\" remains the same. The convention of capitalizing the first letter of every word in a title or header (except for prepositions, articles, and conjunctions) is known as title case. It helps to give equal importance to all the significant words in the title and makes the title more visually appealing and easy to read."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Debs was a prominent labor leader, activist, and five-time Socialist Party of America's candidate for president. He was born on November 5, 1855, in Terre Haute, Indiana, and began his career as a railroad worker and labor union leader, eventually entering politics and becoming a key figure in the American socialist movement. During the 1912 election, Debs competed with other major party candidates: Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson, who eventually won the election; Progressive \\"Bull Moose\\" Party candidate and former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt; and Republican candidate and incumbent President William Howard Taft. Debs and the Socialist Party advocated for a platform focused on labor rights, social welfare programs, and progressive reforms such as increased access to education, healthcare, and fair wages. Throughout his campaign, Debs addressed various social issues, including income inequality, corporate monopolies, and corruption within the political system. He advocated for worker-owned industries and cooperation between businesses to promote equality and fight against the effects of capitalism. One of his key slogans was \\"Workers of the World Unite,\\" which emphasized the need for a collective effort against oppressive systems. Debs gained significant support during the 1912 election, receiving approximately 6% of the popular vote, the highest percentage earned by the Socialist Party in United States history. In total, he accumulated around 900,000 votes, which marked a substantial achievement for the Socialist Party and its ideals. Following the 1912 election, Debs continued his activism and political career, running for president once more in 1920. This time, however, he ran his campaign from prison, where he was incarcerated for his anti-war speeches and charged with violating the Espionage Act during World War I. Despite his imprisonment, Debs still managed to receive around 3.4% of the popular vote in the 1920 election. Eugene V. Debs's political career and activism left a lasting impact on American politics, giving the socialist movement and its advocates a more significant presence in the country.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - A steam locomotive is a railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible materialusually coal/coke, wood, or oilto produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind. The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop.  - Mason is a city in southwestern Warren County, Ohio, United States, approximately from downtown Cincinnati. As of the 2010 census, Mason's population was 30,712.  - Adventure Express is a Mine Train roller coaster located at Kings Island amusement park that opened in 1991 . The ride is located in the Oktoberfest section of Kings Island near Outer Hank 's and the SlingShot . The ride is considered a mine train and has the typical lap bar designed trains , abrupt turns and does not feature inversions . Adventure Express is dedicated to Robert Rinkel , a head of maintenance who died prior to the opening of the coaster . The park placed a plaque dedicating the ride to him on a stone by the entrance to the ride .  - A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the \\"Russian mountains\\" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more \\"inversions\\" (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.  - The Ohio River, which streams westward from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, is the largest tributary, by volume, of the Mississippi River in the United States. At the confluence, the Ohio is considerably bigger than the Mississippi (Ohio at Cairo: 281,500 cu ft/s (7,960 m/s); Mississippi at Thebes: 208,200 cu ft/s (5,897 m/s)) and, thus, is hydrologically the main stream of the whole river system, including the Allegheny River further upstream.  - Cedar Fair, L.P., doing business as the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, is a publicly traded partnership headquartered at its Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. The company owns and operates eleven amusement parks, two outdoor water parks, one indoor water park, and five hotels. Cedar Fair also manages Gilroy Gardens under contract with the city of Gilroy, California.  - Kings Island is a amusement park located northeast of Cincinnati in Mason, Ohio. Owned and operated by Cedar Fair, the park first opened in 1972 by the Taft Broadcasting Company in an effort to move and expand Coney Island, a popular resort destination along the banks of the Ohio River that was prone to frequent flooding. After more than 275 million in capital investments, the park features over 80 rides, shows and attractions including fourteen roller coasters and a water park.  - A water park or waterpark is an amusement park that features water play areas, such as swimming pools, water slides, splash pads, spraygrounds (water playgrounds), lazy rivers, or other recreational bathing, swimming, and barefooting environments. Water parks in more current states of development may also be equipped with some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment such as a wave pool or FlowRider.  - A mine train roller coaster is a steel roller coaster whose trains often depict a set of mine carts, with the forward-most car or portions of it sometimes resembling a small steam locomotive. Most mine train roller coasters are themed in the style of a mine, a Western scene, or simply a mountain range.  - An amusement park (sometimes referred to as a funfair) or theme park is a group of entertainment attractions, rides, and other events in a location for the enjoyment of large numbers of people. Amusement parks have a fixed location, as opposed to travelling funfairs and traveling carnivals, and are more elaborate than simple city parks or playgrounds, usually providing attractions meant to cater specifically to certain age groups, as well as some that are aimed towards all ages. Theme parks, a specific type of amusement park, are usually much more intricately themed to a certain subject or group of subjects than normal amusement parks.  - Cincinnati is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio that serves as county seat of Hamilton County. Settled in 1788, the city is located on the north side of the confluence of the Licking with the Ohio River. With a population of 298,550, Cincinnati is the third-largest city in Ohio and the 65th-largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area is the 28th-largest in the United States and the largest centered in Ohio. The city is also part of the larger CincinnatiMiddletownWilmington combined statistical area, which had a population of 2,172,191 in the 2010 census.  - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus.    What is the relationship between 'adventure express' and 'steel roller coaster'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Adventure Express' and 'steel roller coaster' is that Adventure Express is a specific example of a steel roller coaster. Adventure Express is a mine train roller coaster located at Kings Island amusement park, which features steel tracks and themed mine cart-style trains. Steel roller coasters, as opposed to wooden roller coasters, are constructed with steel tracks, which provide a smoother ride and allow for more complex designs, including inversions and various track elements. In the case of Adventure Express, it has steel tracks, abrupt turns, and a mine train theme, but it does not feature inversions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Option A: 2/7  Option B: 9/4  Option C: 16/25  Option D: 7/1  Option E: 7/2 A:","output":"To solve this problem, we need to make use of the concept of quadratic equations and their roots. Given the quadratic equation: 2kx^2 + 5kx + 2 = 0. We need to find the value of k for which the equation will have equal roots. For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 to have equal roots, its discriminant must be equal to 0. The discriminant (D) is given by the formula: D = b^2 - 4ac In this case, a = 2k, b = 5k, and c = 2. Let's plug these values into the discriminant formula: D = (5k)^2 - 4(2k)(2) Now, we set the discriminant equal to 0 to find the value of k: 0 = 25k^2 - 16k To solve for k, we can factor out k from both terms: 0 = k(25k - 16) There are now two possible solutions for k: 1. k = 0 2. 25k - 16 = 0 We will focus on the second equation since k = 0 would make the quadratic equation trivial (i.e., all coefficients will become 0, resulting in an equation of 0 = 0 which doesn't give us any information about the roots). Let's solve the second equation for k: 25k - 16 = 0 25k = 16 k = 16/25 So, the correct value of k for which the quadratic equation (2kx^2 + 5kx + 2) = 0 will have equal roots is k = 16/25.

Simon was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, creating with Allen Newell the Logic Theory Machine (1956) and the General Problem Solver (GPS) (1957) programs. GPS may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems. Both programs were developed using the Information Processing Language (IPL) (1956) developed by Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Simon. Donald Knuth mentions the development of list processing in IPL, with the linked list originally called \\"NSS memory\\" for its inventors. In 1957, Simon predicted that computer chess would surpass human chess abilities within \\"ten years\\" when, in reality, that transition took about forty years.  In the early 1960s psychologist Ulric Neisser asserted that while machines are capable of replicating \\"cold cognition\\" behaviors such as reasoning, planning, perceiving, and deciding, they would never be able to replicate \\"hot cognition\\" behaviors such as pain, pleasure, desire, and other emotions. Simon responded to Neisser's views in 1963 by writing a paper on emotional cognition, which he updated in 1967 and published in Psychological Review. Simon's work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years, but subsequent work on emotions by Sloman and Picard helped refocus attention on Simon's paper and eventually, made it highly influential on the topic.  Simon also collaborated with James G. March on several works in organization theory.  With Allen Newell, Simon developed a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules. The study of human problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and, with Anders Ericsson, Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis. Simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise. He said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50,000 chunks of information. A chess expert was said to have learned about 50,000 chunks or chess position patterns.  He was awarded the ACM Turing Award, along with Allen Newell, in 1975. \\"In joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years, initially in collaboration with J. C.

On December 4, 1920, when the Red Army entered Yerevan, the government of the First Republic of Armenia effectively surrendered. On December 5 the Armenian Revolutionary Committee , made up of mostly Armenians from Azerbaijan, also entered the city. Finally, on the following day, December 6, Felix Dzerzhinsky's dreaded secret police, the Cheka, entered Yerevan, thus effectively ending all existence of the First Republic of Armenia. The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was then proclaimed, under the leadership of Gevork Atarbekyan. On February 18, 1921, a national revolt against Bolsheviks started. Gen. Garegin Nzhdeh, commander Garo Sasouni and the last Prime Minister of independent Armenia Simon Vratsyan took the lead of the anti-Bolshevik rebellion and forced out the Bolsheviks from Yerevan and other places. By April the Red Army reconquered most part of Armenia. However, Atarbekyan was dismissed and Aleksandr Miasnikyan, an Armenian high-ranking Red Army commander, replaced him. Garegin Nzhdeh left the Zangezur mountains after the Sovietization of Armenia was finalized in July 1921, leaving Azeri-populated villages cleansed of their population.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Location of the Heart The human heart is located within the thoracic cavity, medially between the lungs in the space known as the mediastinum. Figure 19.2 shows the position of the heart within the thoracic cavity. Within the mediastinum, the heart is separated from the other mediastinal structures by a tough membrane known as the pericardium, or pericardial sac, and sits in its own space called the pericardial cavity. The dorsal surface of the heart lies near the bodies of the vertebrae, and its anterior surface sits deep to the sternum and costal cartilages. The great veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the great arteries, the aorta and pulmonary trunk, are attached to the superior surface of the heart, called the base. The base of the heart is located at the level of the third costal cartilage, as seen in Figure 19.2. The inferior tip of the heart, the apex, lies just to the left of the sternum between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages. The right side of the heart is deflected anteriorly, and the left side is deflected posteriorly. It is important to remember the position and orientation of the heart when placing a stethoscope on the chest of a patient and listening for heart sounds, and also when looking at images taken from a midsagittal perspective. The slight deviation of the apex to the left is reflected in a depression in the medial surface of the inferior lobe of the left lung, called the cardiac notch.

Generally, the given sentence seems to point towards an appreciation or acknowledgment of a certain stance or viewpoint on a particular topic or issue. It highlights the importance of perspective in interpreting or understanding situations, arguments, or viewpoints. The use of the term \\"very respectable position\\" indicates a high degree of respect or commendation for the stated viewpoint or stance. This could denote that the viewpoint is well-grounded, substantial, or compelling. Further, the phrase \\"when viewed from one perspective\\" implies a particular angle or lens through which the situation, argument, or viewpoint is being considered. This could refer to a certain theoretical framework, subjective bias, or a specific set of criteria or standards. It suggests that the stance or viewpoint might not be as commendable when seen through a different perspective or set of criteria. So, the holistic meaning of the sentence relies on the idea that while a particular position on a matter appears commendable from one viewpoint, it doesn't necessarily mean that it may find the same degree of acceptance or appreciation from another perspective.

This article: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who composed seven operas in three years at Brunswick?, what is it ?

Q:I can use this background: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.  Now, I have a new situation: David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number.  Answer this question please: Which species would decrease in number, species A and species B? A:","output":"In the context of the theory of evolution by natural selection, the difference in numbers between species A and species B can be attributed to the advantageous and harmful traits they possess. According to the theory, individuals with heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction are more likely to have greater reproductive success, leading to an increase in the number of organisms with those traits over time. On the other hand, organisms with harmful traits are less likely to survive and reproduce in their environment, resulting in a lower reproductive success rate and a decrease in the number of organisms with those traits over time. In the situation you described, species A possesses helpful traits that presumably aid in their survival and reproduction. These advantageous traits enable species A to adapt better to their environment, and as a result, they are more likely to thrive, survive, and reproduce successfully. Over many generations, natural selection will favor the helpful traits in species A, leading to an increase in their numbers. On the contrary, species B possesses harmful traits that are detrimental to their survival and reproduction. These traits make it challenging for species B to adapt to their environment, leaving them less \\"fit\\" compared to species A. As a result, species B will likely experience reduced reproductive success, leading to a decrease in their numbers over time. To summarize, based on the theory of evolution by natural selection, species A, with its helpful traits, will likely increase in number over time, while species B, with its harmful traits, will likely decrease in number. David can use this understanding of natural selection to explain the differing numbers between the two species in the paper he is planning to write. By analyzing the specific traits of species A and species B and the ways in which they impact their respective abilities to survive and reproduce, he can effectively demonstrate why some species flourish and others decline in numbers."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  New York City.  for the following movie plot:  Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) is a 38-year-old father who is in the midst of a divorce.

Please answer the following question: Two signatures. That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

In the review, the customer mentions that the product \\"skips even with a nudge,\\" which indicates a negative experience and suggests that the product does not perform as expected. 3. The customer explicitly states their intention behind buying the product (\\"to use it for my car\\"), but then explains that the product does not meet their expectations, leading to dissatisfaction. 4.

Do employees at Quanta Services have a good work-life balance? Does this differ across positions and departments? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The questions you asked are not the same, as they refer to two different companies, C&J Energy Services and Quanta Services. However, they are similar because they both inquire about the work-life balance of employees within those companies. 1. C&J Energy Services Work-Life Balance: C&J Energy Services is a provider of well construction, well completions, and various services to oil and gas exploration and production companies. The work-life balance of employees at this company can vary, depending on factors such as department, position, workload, and management culture at specific locations.  In general, work-life balance is influenced by the nature of work, working hours, opportunities for growth, job flexibility, and overall company culture. Based on online reviews and forums, some employees at C&J Energy Services report having a good work-life balance, with relatively flexible schedules, especially in administrative and office positions. On the other hand, employees working in field operations, such as drilling or well servicing, may have to work long hours, leading to a more challenging work-life balance.  The work-life balance also varies by department, with some departments having a more structured schedule and manageable workload, while others may involve longer hours and higher demands. Managers and supervisors play an essential role in maintaining a balanced work-life environment for their subordinates. 2. Quanta Services Work-Life Balance: Quanta Services is a leading provider of infrastructure solutions for the electric power, oil and gas, and communications industries. Similar to C&J Energy Services, work-life balance at Quanta Services depends on various factors such as department, position, workload, and management practices. Based on employee reviews and testimonials, it appears that Quanta Services gives importance to work-life balance. However, this may differ across positions and departments within the company. Employees working in administrative, marketing, or finance positions, for instance, might have a more predictable work schedule and, consequently, better work-life balance. Field employees, such as linemen, rig operators, or technicians, might have different experiences, as their work often requires long hours, extensive travel, and demanding conditions. As a result, their work-life balance might be more challenging compared to employees working in desk-based roles.  In conclusion, while both C&J Energy Services and Quanta Services operate in similar industries, the work-life balance for employees at both companies can vary significantly depending on factors such as job position, department, and individual experiences. It is important to research and gather information through employee reviews, company websites, and other available resources to get a better understanding of work-life balance at these companies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question The nervous system is large relative to the bird's size. The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis, New World vultures and tubenoses. The avian visual system is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones. This allows them to perceive ultraviolet light, which is involved in courtship. Birds have specialized light-sensing cells deep in their brains that respond to light without input from eyes or other sensory neurons. These photo-receptive cells in the hypothalamus are involved in detecting the longer days of spring, and thus regulate breeding activities. What regulates breeding activities?","output":"Breeding activities in birds are regulated by specialized light-sensing cells called photo-receptive cells, which are located deep in the hypothalamus of the bird's brain.

Answer the following question: The Transylvanian city of Brasov is usually just a day trip from Bucharest. People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off.  Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere. (For the record, we both opted for a Big Mac and a diet coke.) For the first half day, we wandered around whilst the skies were beautifully blue… …learned a lot of local history, admired the Hollywood style sign in the hills… …slipped into a couple of churches (not to mention dodged giggling kids racing around on miniature cars)… …some hidden, and some hidden in plain sight… …and admired the sign from our cosy hotel, as it lit up at twilight Our only full day dawned fairly murky for the most part, it was a Sunday so a lot of things were closed, so after hitting 20,000 steps and getting lost a few times in the less pretty corners of the city… According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Raj's father (Kiran Kumar) decides to move to England with his family to take up a new job. Before leaving, Raj makes Tina promise to write to him via e-mail.

When the three of them finally meet, Raj, to Pooja's disappointment, completely ignores her and is besotted with Tina, who is as vivacious as ever. However, during the two weeks of his vacation, he cannot help but notice that the real Tina is completely different from the Tina he knew from the e-mails. He also starts to like Pooja, without realizing she is the one he is really in love with. He returns to London, where Pooja coincidentally arrives for an interview, and there he discovers that Pooja was the one who had been writing to him all those years.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the last names of the people who are planning to murder Nick?, using the article: Frank Chambers a drifter, stops at a depression-era rural California diner for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to probation. Months later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant. That night, Katz's assistant, Kennedy, appears at their door and threatens to expose them unless they give him 10,000. Enraged, Frank beats Kennedy up and strong-arms him into giving up the evidence against them., what would be the answer ?

Frank Chambers, a drifter, and Cora Smith, who is married to Nick Papadakis, scheme together to murder Nick so they can start a new life without losing the diner that Cora wishes to own and improve."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reviewer acknowledges that some people might be missing the main message of the book by looking for more straightforward solutions or formulas to achieve their goals. However, they assert that the author's central point – that there are no formulas and only Jesus can provide answers – is a powerful and essential concept to grasp. The reviewer appreciates the book for reinforcing this pivotal message and encouraging readers to seek a relationship with Jesus rather than merely looking for ways to make life work. They even express their intention to read the book again, signifying its profound impact on them. Additionally, they quote passages from the book to emphasize the significance of valuing intimacy over blessings and cherishing the grace offered through a connection with Jesus.

I recently made an offer to return the 130,000 I was previously paid if it was agreed that I could simply tell the truth publicly. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen did not even bother to respond.

So far she has raised nearly 120,000 in contributions, with some chipping in just 10 to support her cause.      Last week she filed a lawsuit saying that Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen \\"aggressively sought to silence\\" her when she planned to make her story public in late 2016.      Now Playing:      Her lawsuit seeks to nullify the s0-called \\"Hush Agreement\\" that Cohen had Daniels sign soon before the election on the grounds that Trump never signed it himself.      On Thursday Chron.com briefly spoke to her attorney, Michael Avenatti, about the account.      \\"We want a forum for her to tell her story to the American people, without a threat of being sued for millions of dollars,\\" Avenatti told Chron.com.      Avenatti did say that the public can expect more to come out regarding the case. When asked what those additional details could be he declined to elaborate.      On Thursday Chron.com was not able to confirm how much money is needed to be raised.      Some have asked Avenatti what will happen to any excess funds collected from the CrowdJustice account.

She has offered to return that sum of money in exchange for being able to tell the truth publicly.

Attorney Michael Avenatti confirmed that several women recently came to him seeking to potentially build legal cases against Trump. He would not identify the women. Avenatti's claim was first reported by BuzzFeed      Trump and the White House have denied all the allegations.      It is unclear whether any women from that group are among those who Avenatti says approached him.      Avenatti filed a lawsuit on Daniels' behalf last week to get her out of a nondisclosure agreement she signed with Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen. The porn star, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, says the agreement was designed to keep her quiet about an alleged 2006 affair with Trump.      Both Cohen and the White House have denied the allegations of an affair between Daniels and Trump.      Cohen admitted that he had paid Clifford 130,000 from his own pocket through a private LLC as part of the deal just before the 2016 election. Her complaint argues the deal is not valid because Trump himself did not sign it, though Cohen did.      JUST WATCHED Lawyer: Trump Org. wanted a muzzle on Daniels Replay More Videos ...

Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished.  By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella. A final sequence (in this case, a TV commercial for dog food that interrupts the film itself) suggests that the world of Hollywood is literally one of dog eats dog. Answer:","output":"The full name of the character with whom Elsa begins to identify with is Lylah Clare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given a statement about date and time, state whether the statement is true or false. The number of date/time operands in the statement ranges between 2 and 3. Let's say the values are denoted by t1, t2 and t3. The statements follow one of the following ten templates: 't1 occurs before t2, t1 doesn't occur before t2, t1 occurs after t2, t1 doesn't occur after t2, t1 occurs between t2 and t3, t1 doesn't occur between t2 and t3, t1 occured before t2 but after t3, t1 occured after t2 but before t3, t1 didn't occur before t2 but after t3, t1 didn't occur after t2 but before t3'. The output should be either 'True' or 'False'. March 08, 2011 doesn't occur between 05 November 1993 and 18 Apr 1974","output":"To determine if the statement is true or false, I will undertake the following steps: 1. Convert the date/time operands (t1, t2, and t3) into a consistent format:    t1: March 08, 2011 => 2011-03-08    t2: 05 November 1993 => 1993-11-05    t3: 18 Apr 1974 => 1974-04-18 2. Assess if the statement fits one of the ten templates. In this case, the statement is a 't1 doesn't occur between t2 and t3' template. 3. Determine whether the statement is true or false based on the date values provided. Given that the statement template is \\"t1 doesn't occur between t2 and t3\\", we must determine if t1 falls outside the range of t2 and t3: - t1: 2011-03-08 - t2: 1993-11-05 - t3: 1974-04-18 Since t3 < t2 and t1 > t2, it is clear that t1 does not occur between t2 and t3.

Who created the scandal by introducing John Profumo to Christine Keeler?","output":"To answer this question, I will need to research the key figures involved in the Profumo affair and understand the relationships among them. Step 1: Understand the main characters of the Profumo affair. John Profumo was the British Secretary of State for War at the time, and Christine Keeler was a model with whom he had a brief affair. Their affair ended up being a scandal when it was revealed that Keeler was also involved with a Soviet naval attaché, causing concerns about the exchange of sensitive information. The subsequent scandal played a role in the downfall of the Conservative government in 1964. Step 2: Identify who introduced John Profumo to Christine Keeler. The person who introduced John Profumo to Christine Keeler was Stephen Ward, an osteopath, and artist with connections to the British high society and the underworld. Ward had a circle of friends that included politicians, celebrities, and socialites and often organized parties where they would interact. It was at one of his parties in 1961 that Profumo met Keeler. To summarize, Stephen Ward created the scandal by introducing John Profumo to Christine Keeler, which eventually led to the Profumo affair and contributed to the downfall of the Conservative government in 1964."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

TLDR at the bottom, So my Ex(23M) and I(F20) had a 4 year relationship, which was very serious and intense. The reason why I broke up with him is because I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him (he always said I'm his true love and he cant imagine anyone else at his side), also partly because my parents pressured me to leave him, they never explicitly said I should dump him, but they always hinted it.  Then 6 months ago I decided to leave him, I just could not see a future with him and my parents ( I love my family more than anything and can't imagine having to decide between a partner or my family), he was very desperate, tried talking me back to him and making promises I knew he couldn't keep. A few days pass and he shows up around 10:00 looking like sh't and very sad. So we talked it out and he accepted the breakup. Then i blocked him on everything (Instagram, Whatsapp) and the last thing i heard from him was when a mutual friend told me he tried to kill himself (not sure how serious his attempt was) And now recently after 6 months of absolutely no contact another friend told me that he had a new gf, I looked into his Instagram and saw a couple of pictures, and seeing how happy they are hurt me very much. I have decided that I want him back, I know for sure he will take me back and from the looks I can tell that he has matured and grown as a person, that gives me hopes  that our relationship will be better than it was.

Answer:","output":"Berry farm, which uses organic methods and refrains from using fertilizers and pesticides, contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers. Organic farming methods focus on sustainable practices that maintain soil fertility, preserve biodiversity, and minimize the impact on the environment. These methods help protect nearby water sources by reducing the risk of harmful chemicals leaching into rivers. In contrast, Rose farm uses conventional agricultural methods, which involve the application of synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides. These chemicals, if not managed properly, can contribute to the contamination of nearby rivers and water bodies through surface runoff, leaching, and drainage processes.

Organisers said \\"challenging ground conditions\\" had been compounded by \\"people not following directions\\", causing tailbacks on local roads. However, they said the event had had a \\"great first year\\" at Strathallan. There were 54 arrests during the four days the festival's campsites were open, on a par with figures from the previous year, and a 36-year-old man was found dead in the toilets on Saturday. The suitability of the local road network for the high volume of festival traffic was one of the issues raised during a planning battle over the choice of Strathallan following the event's move across Perthshire from Balado. After lengthy delays which saw some fans unable to leave the site until 02:00 on the first night of the festival on Friday, bosses apologised and said they would \\"review the situation\\". Event manager Colin Rodger said approximately 500 people had attempted to walk three miles back to an unofficial campsite \\"in an unsuitable location\\", restricting access to pick-up points. After a second night of long queues and delays on Saturday, festival director Geoff Ellis said his team were \\"working hard\\" to rectify delays. Wet conditions left many vehicles needing to be towed from one car park, and Mr Ellis said the current team \\"don't have the benefit of 18 years of infrastructure that we did at Balado\\". He also hit out at a \\"high volume of people\\" attempting to walk from the site, causing tailbacks. A further statement was released on Monday as queues again formed, reading: \\"Due to challenging ground conditions, there have been a number of vehicles in ditches this morning and this compounded with people not following directions and going to the wrong exists which has resulted in these delays.\\" Scottish Conservative MSP Liz Smith said it was \\"not unexpected\\" that there had been delays on the \\"narrow country roads\\". She said: \\"It is very clear that a large number of people who attended the event were very frustrated by what they encountered when they were trying to enter and leave. This led to significant numbers of people walking along dangerous roads. \\"There has to be a major review of what happened this year.\\" Mr Ellis admitted the event had \\"not been perfect\\", but said it had been a \\"great first year\\" overall. He said: \\"We know traffic queues have left some people frustrated and we apologise for this, because obviously we want the experience to be positive for everyone from start to finish. \\"We'll take learnings from this year and will work on improving the times for the future. \\"Overall it's been a great first year at Strathallan - the bands were brilliant, the site looked wonderful and we know that the majority of people have had a fantastic time.\\" Another concern raised in advance of the festival was for the well-being of a pair of ospreys nesting near the site, but RSPB Scotland said the event had gone off without disturbing the protected birds. A spokesman said the birds had been \\"closely monitored\\", and that they had stayed in place behaving normally throughout. Supt Colin Brown of Police Scotland thanked festival-goers for \\"behaving responsibly\\", saying that while some of the 54 arrests had been for \\"more serious offences\\", the majority of them had been detected or had positive lines of inquiry. More than 200 acts played across the weekend, with headline performers including The Libertines, Avicii, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds and Kasabian well received by the crowds.

São Paulo, Brazil (CNN)A Miss Bum-Bum runner-up, Andressa Urach, now admits her obsession with beauty -- and cosmetic surgery -- almost killed her. Urach, 27, launched her career as a model and reality TV star with a face and body sculpted in the operating room. \\"I've had more than 10 surgeries,\\" she told CNN. \\"My nose, my cheekbones, my jaw. I injected my lips numerous times, changed my breasts twice and did liposuction two times.\\" In 2012, she got second place in the uniquely Brazilian contest known as Miss Bum-Bum, or Miss Backside. Modeling contracts followed. \\"I idolized my body, so it had to be perfect,\\" she said during the interview in the São Paulo apartment she shares with her 9-year-old son. Then, she injected her thighs with hydrogel and a plastic known as","output":"PMMA in an attempt to make them fuller and more pronounced. At first, she was thrilled with the results. But soon, she began to experience terrible pain and complications. Her body rejected the substances, and the pain became unbearable. Unbeknownst to Urach, she had developed a severe infection. She was rushed to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed her with necrosis - a condition in which body tissue dies due to a lack of blood supply. The infection had spread rapidly throughout her legs, and doctors were forced to immediately perform surgery in an attempt to save her life. It was touch-and-go, and she spent several weeks in a medically induced coma. During her long and painful recovery, Andressa Urach began to reflect on her life choices. She realized that her obsession with beauty and perfection had driven her to make dangerous decisions. As she lay in the hospital bed, staring at her scarred and battered legs, she knew she couldn't continue down this path any longer. In an effort to change her life and find a new purpose, she turned to faith. Urach became involved with a local church and devoted herself to helping others who, like her, had become consumed by a desire for physical perfection. She began to speak out against cosmetic surgery and share her story as a cautionary tale. Urach also wrote a book about her experiences, \\"Dying to Be Beautiful,\\" which became a bestseller in Brazil. Through her journey to self-acceptance and her newfound devotion to community service, she was able to inspire a nation with her message of hope and personal redemption. Her son, who had witnessed his mother's transformation firsthand, grew up to admire her for her strength and resilience. Though the world knew her once as a Miss Bum-Bum runner-up, Andressa Urach's legacy now stands for so much more — a tale of survival, self-reflection, and the beauty of inner strength and self-love. In the final chapter of her story, Urach uses her experience to teach others about the dangers of excessive cosmetic surgery and the importance of finding self-worth from within. With her newfound sense of purpose, she utilizes her platform to help others and makes it her mission to promote the message that true beauty lies in the love and acceptance of oneself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: A city official in the remote Brazilian Amazon village of Envira told CNN that five members of the Kulina tribe are on the run after being accused of murdering, butchering and eating a farmer in a ritual act of cannibalism. The village's chief of staff, Maronilton da Silva Clementino, said Kulina tribesmen took the life of Ocelio Alves de Carvalho, 19, last week on the outskirts of Envira, which is in the far western part of Brazil that bumps up against Peru. Portal Amazonia newspaper reported that the Indians escaped after being held for a few hours in the city's police station. No arrest warrants were issued. Brazilian law does not allow the military or civil police to enter Indian lands, Portal Amazonia reported. It is still unknown how many people took part in the alleged cannibalistic ritual, although several Indians have fled into the jungle fearing prosecution, the newspaper Diario do Amazonas reported. Clementino said the victim was herding cattle when he met with a group of Indians who invited him back to their village. \\"They knew each other and they sometimes helped one another. They invited him to their reservation three days ago and he was never seen again,\\" Clementino said. \\"The family decided to go into the reservation and that's when they saw his body quartered and his skull hanging on a tree. It was very tragic for the family,\\" he said. The news of the incident came from the Indians themselves, who apparently bragged about eating the man's organs, Clementino said. Members of the tribe told residents of Envira -- where 190 Kulina families brush shoulders with non-tribal Brazilians -- that they held a cannibalistic ritual in which they cooked the victim's organs, Clementino said. He said Kulina Indians began surrounding the police station where the suspects were briefly interrogated. Villagers told authorities they are incensed by the lack of response from FUNAI, Brazil's National Indian Foundation. \\"The family is very frustrated with the law here, which protects the Indians and doesn't help protect us,\\" he said. \\"They start drinking and local farmers here are afraid who could be next.\\" Clementino said groups Indians -- often outnumbering police -- pose a security threat to locals. He said the man's family are upset that authorities did not arrive until three days later. But a FUNAI official told the newspaper Voz do Acre that access to Envira is very difficult, requiring long boat or helicopter rides. According to FUNAI, about 2,500 Kulina live in Brazil's Acre state, which borders with Peru, where 450 Kulina live. This remote jungle corridor is known for its isolated tribes. The Kulina are classified as an \\"isolated\\" tribe but some have contact with the non-indian population. The Kulina are also known for their complex language. FUNAI studies show that Kulina women speak a completely different language from the men. According to FUNAI, there are 460,000 Indians in Brazil and 1,300 indian languages. There are 55 groups considered to live in isolation.","output":"Five members of the Kulina tribe in the remote Brazilian Amazon village of Envira are accused of murdering, butchering, and eating a farmer in a ritual act of cannibalism.

The Kulina tribe members allegedly bragged about eating the man's organs, and the village's chief of staff, Maronilton da Silva Clementino, later stated that they held a cannibalistic ritual involving the victim's organs.

The news sparked anger and fear among local residents, who accused authorities of inaction and blamed FUNAI, Brazil's National Indian Foundation, for providing insufficient protection.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  Now, I have a new situation: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  Answer this question please: Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","output":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored, which means that the reactants are being converted into products at a faster rate. As a result, the concentration of the reactants would decrease because more of the reactants are being used up to form products.  On the other hand, in case B, the reverse reaction is favored. This means that the products are being converted back into reactants at a faster rate. In this situation, the concentration of reactants would increase because the products are breaking down and returning to the original reactants. Comparing case A and case B, the reactants concentration would increase in case B compared to case A. This is because the system is favoring the reverse reaction in case B, which results in an increase in the reactants concentration, while the forward reaction is favored in case A, leading to a decrease in the reactants concentration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The Azerbaijan-based midfielder, who was born in Ondo state to Nigerian parents, decided to play for Leone Stars four years ago - claiming his maternal grandfather was from Sierra Leone. Since doubts over Kayode's eligibility were removed, five different coaches have taken charge of Sierra Leone, but he is still awaiting his first call-up. I think if the Leone Stars coach wants me he can check my records and he'll see that I'm qualified and ready to play \\"I'm not given up as I still want to play for Sierra Leone,\\" Kayode told BBC Sport. The player, who turns 30 in September, came close to making his debut for Sierra Leone when he travelled with Leone Stars to Monastir to face Tunisia in October 2012. But he failed to make Leone Stars' final 18-man squad for the decisive 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match which ended goalless, a result that eliminated Sierra Leone. \\"I never regret my decision to play for Sierra Leone despite the fact I'm yet to make my debut and I'm looking forward to being given the chance,\\" said Kayode. \\"I'm not frustrated, there is time for everything,\\" he added. Kayode who currently plays for Azerbaijan top flight league club Zire FC believes he has what it takes to play for Sierra Leone and urges the current Leone Stars coach Sellas Tetteh to follow his performances at club level. \\"I'm a regular in my team and I'm doing well. That is what many coaches look for,\\" Kayode added. \\"I think if the Leone Stars coach wants me he can check my records and he'll see that I'm qualified and ready to play. \\"However, I hope to personally introduce myself and ask him to give me a chance.\\" Kayode says his decision to choose Sierra Leone over Nigeria was not taken because he knew his chances to play for the Super Eagles may be very slim. \\"That was never the case. Nigeria are a big country and not everyone can play for his country of birth. \\"I've chosen Sierra Leone because I believe God wanted me to play for the country of my maternal grandfather,\\" he insisted. Kayode's story with Sierra Leone started when he was introduced to former Leone Stars coach Lars Olof Mattsson by friend and ex- skipper Ibrahim Kargbo in June 2012. He trained with Leone Stars ahead of World Cup and Nations Cup qualifiers that same year and was considered for Sierra Leone after impressing Mattsson. Kayode has only played club football in Azerbaijan where he has featured for four clubs since he moved there a decade ago. A summary of the above article is?","output":"The article discusses the journey of an Azerbaijan-based Nigerian football player, Kayode, who chose to represent Sierra Leone internationally due to his maternal grandfather's origins. Despite switching allegiance four years prior, Kayode hasn't received his first call-up to join the Leone Stars, but remains optimistic and determined to play for the team. The 30-year-old player hopes to catch the attention of Leone Stars coach Sellas Tetteh through his performances in the Azerbaijan top-flight league club, Zire FC. Kayode denies that he chose Sierra Leone over Nigeria because of a potential lack of chances in the Nigerian national team, asserting that his decision was divinely inspired by his heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who got there revenge on Kano? Movie title: Mortal Kombat Movie plot: The film is centered on Mortal Kombat, a fighting tournament between the representatives of the realms of Earth and Outworld conceived by the Elder Gods amid looming invasion of the Earth by Outworld. If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor Shao Kahn will be able to invade and conquer the Earth realm. Shaolin monk Liu Kang and his comrades, movie star Johnny Cage and military officer Sonya Blade were handpicked by Raiden, the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord Kano; and Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise. At Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to Princess Kitana, Shao Kahn's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature Reptile to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats Scorpion. Liu engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him cryptic advice for his next battle. Liu's next opponent is Sub-Zero, whose defense seems untouched because of his freezing abilities, until Liu recalls Kitana's advice and uses it to kill Sub-Zero. Prince Goro enters the tournament and mercilessly crushes every opponent he faces. One of Cage's peers, Art Lean, is defeated by Goro as well and has his soul taken by Shang Tsung. Sonya worries that they may not win against Goro, but Raiden disagrees. He reveals their own fears and egos are preventing them from winning the tournament. Despite Sonya's warning, Cage comes to Tsung to request a fight with Goro. The sorcerer...","output":"Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional 100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the 50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war. For decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property. Last month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on 50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied. China gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal. Beijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles.  In other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between 225 billion and 600 billion every year. That rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \\"We can't afford to give up our technology,\\" Kudlow said Friday. \\"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\\" The Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently...

Context: One spring it stopped raining in early March and didn't start again. There was one very well-off bunny in the village who had a large burrow and lots of food saved up. He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been. Question: What is most likely true about Reverend Billy Bunny? Options: - He is scared that the drought won't end - He is hopeful that the drought will be over - not enough information - He is happy that the drought is happening Answer:","output":"He is hopeful that the drought will be over"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Addison, as described in the provided scenario, appears to be impulsive and eager to take control of the machine. This action, resulting from a lack of patience and an inability to wait for the completion of their training, indicates that Addison possesses an impatient personality. Impatient individuals are typically marked by their intolerance for delays or obstacles. They tend to take hasty actions, often overlooking important details or ignoring warnings. In some situations, this impatience could be a sign of enthusiasm or ambition. However, in certain circumstances, such as operating complex machinery or learning new skills, it can lead to negative consequences, as evidenced by Addison's situation. In contrast, cautious and patient individuals approach tasks with meticulous care and attention to detail. They understand the importance of completing necessary steps and taking the time to learn properly. These qualities can often lead to more successful and safe outcomes in various situations. In conclusion, Addison's actions reveal impatience, demonstrated by taking control of the machine without completing the necessary training.

After the Ashton Canal closed in the 1960s, it was decided to turn the Portland Basin warehouse into a museum. In 1985, the first part of the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.The earliest parts of Ashton Town Hall, which was the first purpose-built town hall in what is now Tameside, date to 1840 when it was opened. It has classical features such as the Corinthian columns on the entrance facade. Enlarged in 1878, the hall provides areas for administrative purposes and public functions. Meanwhile, the Old Street drill hall was completed in 1887. There are five parks in the town, three of which have Green Flag Awards. The first park opened in Ashton-under-Lyne was Stamford Park on the border with Stalybridge. The park opened in 1873, following a 17-year campaign by local cotton workers; the land was bought from a local mill-owner for £15,000 (£1.4 million as of 2019) and further land was donated by George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford. A crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 turned out to see the Earl of Stamford formally open the new facility on 12 July 1873. It now includes a boating lake, and a memorial to Joseph Rayner Stephens, commissioned by local factory workers to commemorate his work promoting fair wages and improved working conditions. A conservatory was opened in 1907, and Coronation gates installed at both the Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge entrances in 1953.Hartshead Pike is a stone tower on top of Hartshead Hill overlooking Ashton and Oldham.

Webb, who previously visited Myanmar in 2009, has a history of advocating for more open communication and dialogue with the Southeast Asian nation. In his upcoming visit, Senator Webb aims to engage with key stakeholders in Myanmar, including government representatives, opposition leaders, and members of civil society. He is particularly interested in learning more about the ongoing democratic reforms and human rights situation in the country. Webb's commitment to maintaining a line of communication with Myanmar stems, in part, from his belief that the US has a role to play in supporting democratic development in the region. By visiting the country and engaging in firsthand dialogue, Webb hopes to gain valuable insights that can be used to inform US policy decisions related to Myanmar. This visit also represents a broader effort on the part of the US government to reengage with the wider region and to refresh its rapidly evolving strategic framework vis-a-vis Southeast Asia. With increasing attention on the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, many US policymakers see an opportunity to strengthen relationships and build partnerships that can be mutually beneficial. Senator Webb's forthcoming trip to Myanmar exemplifies this diplomatic reorientation and demonstrates a keen interest in better understanding the complexities, challenges, and opportunities that exist within this diverse and changing part of the world.

Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city.  - Beres Hammond OJ ( born Hugh Beresford Hammond , 28 August 1955 , Annotto Bay , Saint Mary , Jamaica ) is a reggae singer known in particular for his romantic lovers rock and soulful voice . While his career began in the 1970s , he reached his greatest success in the 1990s .  - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938  November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.  - Lovers rock is a style of reggae music noted for its romantic sound and content. While love songs had been an important part of reggae since the late 1960s, the style was given a greater focus and a name in London in the mid-1970s. Despite the name, lovers rock is not a rock subgenre or related to it.  - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums.  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants.  - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it.

Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Philistines. Yes or no? Answer: Originating somewhere in the Aegean , their population was around 25,000 in the 12th century BC, rising to a peak of 30,000 in the 11th century BC, of which the Aegean element was not more than half the total, and perhaps much less. Question: where in the bible that palestine have no land in jerusalem Answer:","output":"The question of Palestine having no land in Jerusalem according to the Bible is not explicitly stated in a singular verse or passage. However, it is essential to understand the historical and geographical context in which the Bible was written to address this issue accurately. The word \\"Palestine\\" is derived from \\"Philistia,\\" the territory inhabited by the Philistines, who were a non-Semitic people originating in the Aegean region. Ancient Philistia consisted of the coastal area along the Mediterranean Sea between modern-day Tel Aviv, Israel, and Gaza Strip. The Philistines were known to have frequent conflicts with the Israelites in the biblical period. Jerusalem, on the other hand, is inland from the ancient Philistine territory and has been the capital of various ancient kingdoms, namely, the Jebusites, Israel, and Judah. The Bible, primarily in the Old Testament, records stories related to both the Philistines and Jerusalem's significance for the Israelites. One of the most well-known conflicts between the Israelites and Philistines is the story of David and Goliath, which can be found in 1 Samuel 17. David, who later became the king of Israel, secured Jerusalem as its capital after conquering the Jebusite city (2 Samuel 5:6-9). Although the Philistines are mentioned several times in the context of wars and conflicts with the Israelites, there is no specific verse in the Bible explicitly stating that \\"Palestine\\" (Philistine) had no land in Jerusalem. Throughout biblical accounts, Jerusalem is associated with the Israelites, while the Philistines are often depicted as adversaries of the Israelites. It is essential to differentiate modern-day Palestine from the ancient Philistines. The modern usage of \\"Palestine\\" often refers to the geographic territory that constitutes present-day Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip, where various peoples, including Arabs and Jews, both historically and currently reside. In summary, while there is no verse explicitly stating that Palestine had no land in Jerusalem in the Bible, the biblical accounts generally portray the Philistines as separate adversaries of the Israelites, rather than inhabitants of Jerusalem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This will mimic a light rainstorm, dampen the birds' feathers, and allow them to better groom, clean, and straighten the plumage. Do not spray the finches directly in the face.","output":"Finches are small yet active birds, and proper grooming is essential to maintain good health and hygiene. As mentioned above, misting your finches with a water bottle daily is a great start. Let's discuss in-depth grooming methods to provide the best care for your finches. 1. Mist baths: It's important to recreate a natural environment as much as possible. In addition to misting your finches, you can provide a shallow bath filled with fresh water. Make sure it's only about half an inch deep to avoid drowning risks. Birds are instinctively inclined to bathe themselves, and this would help them clean their feathers more effectively. 2. Cage cleaning: Providing a clean environment is crucial for the overall health and grooming of your finches. Make sure to clean the cage regularly, preferably once a week, thoroughly wiping down the bars and perches with a mild avian-safe disinfectant. Change the cage lining or clean the cage floor regularly to avoid the build-up of feces, uneaten food, and any other debris that may contribute to a dirty environment. 3. Proper perches: Providing rough-textured perches, like natural wood or rope perches, can help with finch grooming. These surfaces help to wear down their nails and beak as they climb and move around the cage. Regular monitoring of beak and nail length is helpful in determining any additional grooming requirements. 4. A well-balanced diet: Supplying your finches with a balanced diet of high-quality seeds, vegetables, and fruits will contribute to their overall health, providing them with the essential nutrients for maintaining good grooming habits. A healthy bird is more likely to engage in self-grooming activities. 5. Regular health checks: Routinely observe your finch's behavior and appearance. Take note if they appear fluffed up, lethargic, or if there is any indication of skin or feather disorders. Consulting an avian veterinarian when any health concerns arise is important to address grooming issues tied to medical conditions. 6. Avoid overcrowding: Ensuring the cage is spacious enough for your finches helps to reduce stress and encourages normal activities like grooming. Overcrowding can result in squabbles, poor sanitary conditions, and inadequate space for activities, leading to neglect in grooming habits. 7. Providing enrichment: Offer toys, swings, and branches to keep your finches entertained and to encourage activities in your birds. This not only maintains their health and well-being but also promotes natural grooming behaviors. In summary, essential grooming requirements for finches include daily misting or baths, maintaining a clean environment, providing the right perches, ensuring a well-balanced diet, monitoring their health, and providing sufficient space and enrichment to promote natural grooming behavior. Taking these steps will ensure that your finches remain healthy, clean, and well-groomed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

'The Orbit' is the huge sculpture that's been built next to the Olympic Stadium in London. The giant tower has been designed by world famous sculptor Anish Kapoor. It's hoped it'll attract as much attention as the famous 'Bird's Nest' stadium in Beijing for the last Olympics. 5,000 visitors a day will be able to go up to get amazing views. It's not been cheap to build though, costing over Â£20 million, but most of that has been given by a rich company that makes steel. Some people have described the unusual looking Orbit as looking like an exploding red paper clip and a fairground helter-skelter gone wrong! Once it opens to the public in July visitors will be able to catch a lift up the 35-storeys to the top.

Answer:","output":"The blocks that support rails for railway tracks are called sleepers or railroad ties. Sleepers are critical components of a railroad infrastructure, as they provide essential support and stability to the rails, ensuring the smooth and safe passage of trains. Sleepers serve multiple purposes in the construction and maintenance of railway tracks. Some of their most important functions include: 1. Providing a stable and firm base for the rails: Sleepers evenly distribute the weight of trains across the track bed, ensuring stability and reducing the risk of rail deformation or buckling. By maintaining a consistent rail gauge – the distance between the inner sides of the two rails – sleepers help minimize derailments caused by misaligned tracks. 2. Anchoring the rails to the ground: With the use of fastening systems, such as clips, spikes or bolts, sleepers help secure rails in place and prevent them from shifting due to friction, vibration, thermal expansion, or contraction. 3. Absorbing vibrations: Sleepers, in combination with ballast – the crushed stones surrounding the sleepers – help dampen the vibrations and noise created by passing trains, thereby reducing wear and tear on the rails and protecting nearby structures, such as buildings and bridges. 4. Facilitating drainage: Sleepers work in conjunction with ballast to create a track structure that enables water to drain away from the rails. Proper drainage is crucial for preventing track damage caused by standing water and frost heave in freezing conditions. Sleepers are typically made from a variety of materials, each with their own advantages and drawbacks: 1. Wooden sleepers – Made from hardwood, such as oak, these sleepers have been used for centuries and are known for their durability and ease of use. However, they can be susceptible to decay and damage from insects, and often require treatment with preservatives to ensure longevity. 2. Concrete sleepers – Introduced in the 20th century, concrete sleepers offer increased strength and durability over wooden alternatives. They also resist decay and insect damage and require less maintenance. However, they are heavier and more difficult to handle, often requiring special equipment for installation. 3. Steel sleepers – Steel sleepers are strong and durable, with excellent resistance to corrosion and decay. They are also lighter than concrete sleepers and can be more easily installed and replaced. However, they can be more expensive than other options and can be susceptible to heat-induced deformation. 4. Composite sleepers – Made from a combination of materials such as recycled plastics or rubber, composite sleepers are an environmentally friendly option. They offer excellent durability, resistance to decay, and vibration absorption, while being lightweight and easy to handle. In conclusion, sleepers, or railroad ties, are crucial components of the railway infrastructure, ensuring the stability, safety, and longevity of the tracks. Available in a range of materials, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages, sleepers play an indispensable role in supporting rails and enabling the efficient operation of railway systems worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Militants warned of retaliation if a prisoner died in Israeli custody. Gaza militants have regularly launched rocket attacks.","output":"Title: Gaza Militant Group Claims Responsibility for Attacks on IDF Crossings Introduction: The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a militant group based in Gaza, have recently claimed responsibility for an attack on two Israel Defense Forces (IDF) crossings. This attack comes in response to threats made by militants regarding retaliation if a prisoner were to die in Israeli custody. With a history of regular rocket attacks launched by Gaza militants, the situation continues to escalate in the region. Strictures on Two Crossings: In a show of force and growing tensions, the IDF has placed strictures on two crossings between Israel and Gaza. These measures are put in place to control the flow of people and goods across the border and minimize potential threats to Israeli citizens. As tensions rise, these strictures may tighten further in response to ongoing conflicts and threats. Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades Claim Responsibility: The Gaza-based militant group Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades have claimed responsibility for the attacks on the IDF crossings. As a part of their ongoing struggle against Israel, these attacks represent a continuous effort to disrupt the security and stability in the region. By targeting IDF crossings, they seek to directly challenge the Israeli military presence and demonstrate their resolve against the Israeli state. Retaliation Threats: Prior to the attacks, militants warned of potential retaliation if any prisoner died while in the custody of Israeli authorities. This demonstrates the volatility of the situation, as both sides remain at odds in handling the complex issue of prisoners and territorial control. The public warning and the subsequent attacks highlight the depth of enmity between both parties, with no signs of de-escalation in sight. Regular Rocket Attacks: Gaza militants have a long history of launching rocket attacks into Israel, aiming to cause damage, disrupt daily life, and exert pressure on the Israeli government. These frequent attacks further strain the relations between Israel and Gaza, making it difficult for peace negotiations or any meaningful cooperation to occur. With the recent attacks on IDF crossings, the situation appears to be growing more precarious. Conclusion: The attacks claimed by the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades on the IDF crossings highlight the ongoing conflict and tension between Israel and Gaza. With strictures being placed on crossings, retaliation threats from militants, and a history of regular rocket attacks, the prospects for a peaceful resolution seem increasingly distant. Both sides need to engage in meaningful dialogue and pursue diplomacy to reduce this deeply-rooted animosity and work towards a peaceful future in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Alla breve is a musical meter notated by the time signature symbol (a C with a line through it), which is the equivalent of . The term is Italian for \\"in the style of the breve\\".  - An eighth note ( American ) or a quaver ( British ) is a musical note played for half the value of a quarter note ( crotchet ) and twice that of the sixteenth note ( semiquaver ) , which amounts to one quarter the duration of a half note ( minim ) , one eighth the duration of whole note ( semibreve ) , one sixteenth the duration of a double whole note ( breve ) , and one thirty - second the duration of a longa , hence the name . It is the equivalent of the fusa in mensural notation ( Morehen and Rastell 2001 ) Eighth notes are notated with an oval , filled - in note head and a straight note stem with one flag note flag ( see Figure 1 ) . A related symbol is the eighth rest ( or quaver rest ) , which denotes a silence for the same duration . In Unicode , the symbols U +266A (  ) and U +266B (  ) are an eighth note and beamed pair of eighth notes respectively . The two symbols are inherited from the early 1980s code page 437 , where they occupied codes 13 and 14 respectively . Additions to the Unicode standard also incorporated additional eighth note depictions from Japanese emoji sets : ascending eighth notes ( U +1F39C ,  ) , descending eighth noes ( U +1F39D ,  ) , a graphical generic musical note generally depicted as an eighth note ( U +1F3B5 ,  ) , and three unconnected eighth notes in sequence ( U +1F3B6 ,  ) . Unicode 's Musical Symbols block includes several variations of the eighth note ; these are the versions intended to be used in computerized musical notation ( as opposed to the others , which are graphical dingbats ) . As with all notes with stems , the general rule is that eighth notes are drawn with stems to the right of the notehead , facing up , when they are below the middle line of the musical staff . When they are on or above the middle line , they are drawn with stems on the left of the note head , facing down . Alternatively , stems are used to indicate voicing or parts ; all stems for the upper voice 's notes ( or \`\` parts '' ) are drawn facing up , regardless of their position on the...  - Mensural notation is the musical notation system used for European vocal polyphonic music from the later part of the 13th century until about 1600. The term \\"mensural\\" refers to the ability of this system to describe precisely measured rhythmic durations in terms of numerical proportions between note values. Its modern name is inspired by the terminology of medieval theorists, who used terms like \\"musica mensurata\\" (\\"measured music\\") or \\"cantus mensurabilis\\" (\\"measurable song\\") to refer to the rhythmically defined polyphonic music of their age, as opposed to \\"musica plana\\" or \\"musica choralis\\", i.e., Gregorian plainchant. With mensural notation being employed principally for compositions in the tradition of vocal polyphony, plainchant retained its own, older system of neume notation throughout the period, while some purely instrumental music could be written in various forms of instrument-specific tablature notation.  - In music, a whole note (American) or semibreve (British) is a note represented by a hollow oval note head and no note stem. Its length is equal to four beats in time, that is the whole measure (or bar). Most other notes are fractions of the whole note (e.g., half notes and quarter notes are played for one half and one quarter the duration of the whole note, respectively).  - In music, a double whole note (American), breve (international), or double note is a note lasting two times as long as a whole note (or \\"semibreve\\"). In medieval mensural notation, the \\"brevis\\" (ancestor of the modern breve) was one of the shortest note lengthshence its name, which is the Latin etymon of \\"brief\\" . In \\"perfect\\" rhythmic mode, the brevis was a third of a \\"longa\\", or in \\"imperfect\\" mode half a \\"longa\\" (for full details of the complications here, see for example ). However, in modern music notation it is the longest note value still in common use .  - In music, a half note (American) or minim (British) is a note played for half the duration of a whole note (or semibreve) and twice the duration of a quarter note (or crotchet). It was given its Latin name (\\"minim\\", meaning \\"least or smallest\\") because it was the shortest of the five note values used in early medieval music notation . In time signatures with 4 as the bottom number, such as or time, the half note is two beats long. However, when 2 is the bottom number (including \\"alla breve\\"), the half note is one beat long.  - A quarter note (American) or crotchet (British, from the sense 'hook') is a note played for one quarter of the duration of a whole note (or \\"semibreve\\"). Often, musicians will say that a crotchet is one beat, but this is not always correct, as the beat is indicated by the time signature of the music; a quarter note may or may not be the beat. Quarter notes are notated with a filled-in oval note head and a straight, flagless stem. The stem usually points upwards if it is below the middle line of the stave or downwards if it is on or above the middle line. However, the stem direction may differentiate more than one part. The head of the note also reverses its orientation in relation to the stem. (See image.)  - A neume (sometimes spelled neum) is the basic element of Western and Eastern systems of musical notation prior to the invention of five-line staff notation. The word entered the English language in the Middle English forms \\"newme\\", \\"nevme\\", \\"neme\\" in the 15th century, from the Middle French \\"neume\\", in turn from either medieval Latin \\"pneuma\\" or \\"neuma\\", the former either from ancient Greek (\\"breath\\") or (\\"sign\\"), or else directly from Greek as a corruption or an adaptation of the former.  - Tablature (or tabulature, or tab for short) is a form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - In music, a 16th note (American) or semiquaver (British) is a note played for half the duration of an eighth note (quaver), hence the name. It is the equivalent of the semifusa in mensural notation, first found in 15th-century notation .  - The time signature (also known as meter signature, metre signature, or measure signature) is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are to be contained in each bar and which note value is to be given one beat. In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as or (read \\"common time\\" and \\"three-four time\\", respectively), immediately following the key signature or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty. A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a barline, indicates a change of meter.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'eighth note' exhibits the relationship of 'instance of'.

This is the horrifying moment greyhounds charged into the traps at their top speed of around 40mph after race organisers failed to lift them from the track. Footage at Romford track in east London last week shows how the dogs were so focussed on chasing the hare several could not avoid the obstruction in front of them. Incredibly the dogs who managed to avoid the trap quickly turned round and ran back to check on their fellow greyhounds. No dogs were killed in the incident, although two  are being treated for injuries by vets who will assess if they can ever race again, a source said. Collision: Two greyhounds were injured after they ploughed into the traps during a race after they failed to be lifted from the track. Aftermath: Dogs in the race turned on their heels and sprinted back to check on the other greyhounds. An investigation has been launched by Coral, the  owners of the track. The bookmaker said the mechanism that lifts the stalls failed and the driver of the 'hare', which the dogs follow round the track, was not notified to stop it. Anti-dog racing campaign group Greyt Exploitations says that  Romford is the country's 'worst offender' for track injuries, but bosses say they are 'more diligent' and professional than other tracks. Greyt Exploitations' figures for the first five months of 2014 show that 221 dogs were involved in track injuries or incidents at Romford, and 86 of the dogs had not raced again by October. Race: The greyhounds sped round the bend during the first lap only to be met with the large metal structure blocking the track. Accident: Coral say it was a tragic accident and lessons would be learned to ensure it didn't happen again. Campaigner Trudy Baker said: 'I am absolutely appalled by the video. How was there no procedure in place for when the trap won't lift? And if there is a procedure, why didn't it work?. 'Romford has the highest numbers for track injuries. They say that is because they are more diligent, but the film shows the complete opposite.' Coral are investigating the cause of the failures. A spokesman said: 'We have carried out an internal investigation into the events that occurred last week at Romford which resulted in injuries being suffered to two greyhounds. 'At this stage we are not certain what caused the failure in the mechanism that removes the traps from the track but we suspect that the very cold temperatures on the night may have been responsible. We are continuing to investigate the cause of this in order to reduce the likelihood of it occurring again. 'We do however have processes in place, should this mechanism fail, to alert the hare driver to stop the hare, but unfortunately these were not followed last night leading to the greyhounds continuing. This was unacceptable and avoidable and we will review these processes and carry out further training to ensure that an incident like this never happens again'.

A: Answer:","output":"The term for a relationship between two organisms where at least one benefits is called \\"symbiosis.\\" Symbiosis is an ecological interaction that can be further divided into three main types: 1. Mutualism: In mutualism, both organisms benefit from the relationship. A classic example would be the relationship between bees and flowers. Bees collect nectar from flowers for food, while flowers get their pollen spread by the bees which helps in their reproduction. 2. Commensalism: Commensalism occurs when one species benefits from the relationship and the other is unaffected. An example of this is the relationship between an epiphytic plant and the tree it grows on. The epiphytic plant gets support and access to nutrients without harming the tree. 3. Parasitism: In parasitism, one species benefits at the expense of the other, causing harm to the host organism. Examples include ticks that feed on the blood of other animals, weakening the host over time. In summary, symbiosis indicates an ecological relationship between two organisms in which at least one party benefits. The specific type of symbiosis (mutualism, commensalism, or parasitism) further characterizes the nature of the association and the impact it has on the involved organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Increased awareness of the health consequences of eating too much sugar has fueled a dramatic uptick in the consumption of zero-calorie artificial sweeteners in recent decades. However, new research finds sugar replacements can also cause health changes that are linked with diabetes and obesity, suggesting that switching from regular to diet soda may be a case of 'out of the frying pan, into the fire.'      Artificial sweeteners are one of the most common food additives worldwide, frequently consumed in diet and zero-calorie sodas and other products. While some previous studies have linked artificial sweeteners with negative health consequences, earlier research has been mixed and raised questions about potential bias related to study sponsorship.      This new study is the largest examination to date that tracks biochemical changes in the body--using an approach known as unbiased high-throughput metabolomics--after consumption of sugar or sugar substitutes. Researchers also looked at impacts on vascular health by studying how the substances affect the lining of blood vessels. The studies were conducted in rats and cell cultures.      \\"Despite the addition of these non-caloric artificial sweeteners to our everyday diets, there has still been a drastic rise in obesity and diabetes,\\" said lead researcher Brian Hoffmann, PhD, assistant professor in the department of biomedical engineering at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Marquette University. \\"In our studies, both sugar and artificial sweeteners seem to exhibit negative effects linked to obesity and diabetes, albeit through very different mechanisms from each other.\\"      Hoffmann will present the research at the American Physiological Society annual meeting during the 2018 Experimental Biology meeting, held April 21-25 in San Diego.      The team fed different groups of rats diets high in glucose or fructose (kinds of sugar), or aspartame or acesulfame potassium (common zero-calorie artificial sweeteners). After three weeks, the researchers saw significant differences in the concentrations of biochemicals, fats and amino acids in blood samples.      The results suggest artificial sweeteners change how the body processes fat and gets its energy. In addition, they found acesulfame potassium seemed to accumulate in the blood, with higher concentrations having a more harmful effect on the cells that line blood vessels.      \\"We observed that in moderation, your body has the machinery to handle sugar; it is when the system is overloaded over a long period of time that this machinery breaks down,\\" Hoffmann said. \\"We also observed that replacing these sugars with non-caloric artificial sweeteners leads to negative changes in fat and energy metabolism.\\"      So, which is worse, sugar or artificial sweeteners? Researchers cautioned that the results do not provide a clear answer and the question warrants further study. It is well known that high dietary sugar is linked to negative health outcomes and the study suggests artificial sweeteners do, too.      \\"It is not as simple as 'stop using artificial sweeteners' being the key to solving overall health outcomes related to diabetes and obesity,\\" Hoffmann added. \\"If you chronically consume these foreign substances (as with sugar) the risk of negative health outcomes increases. As with other dietary components, I like to tell people moderation is the key if one finds it hard to completely cut something out of their diet.\\"      Brian Hoffmann will present this research on Sunday, April 22, from 10 a.m.-noon in the San Diego Convention Center Exhibit Hall (poster A322) (abstract).

Well, if you attended a presentation at the Experimental Biology 2018 conference in San Diego, you may say, rats, the risk may be far from zero.      To be fair, nothing has zero health risk. Even though eating broccoli in general is quite healthy, you could still bludgeon yourself with broccoli, and eating huge amounts of broccoli could lead to obesity as well as some serious gas and loss of friends. However, the main advertised benefit of artificial sweeteners, such as those in diet soda, is that they don't contain the calories and the accompanying obesity, diabetes, and other health-related risks of sugar.      The study presented by Brian Hoffmann, George Ronan, and Dhanush Haspula from the Medical College of Wisconsin suggested that things may not be that sweet for artificial sweeteners. They did a combination of in vitro (which essential means inside a test tube or similar equipment) and in vivo (meaning in a live animal) experiments using rats that were specially designed to be more susceptible to developing diabetes. For the in vitro experiments, the research team placed cells from the inside lining of the rats' small blood vessels into test tubes and exposed these cells to either sugar or a common artificial sweetener. Why the inside lining of blood vessels? Well, one of the effects of diabetes is to cause damage to small blood vessels, which then results in many of the complications of diabetes such as loss of eyesight, kidney function, and blood circulation to various parts of the body.      The in vitro experiments found that both sugars and artificial sweeteners interfered with glycosylation, a key step in which sugars are added to proteins that then affects how the proteins function. Therefore, messing up glycosylation could affect a number of functions that various proteins perform in the cells. The research team did find that sugar and artificial sweeteners seemed to affect the expression of different genes differently, which implies that the way that they affect glycosylation may be different. Nonetheless, the fact that both disrupt this key biochemical process raises concerns.      The second in vivo part of the study involved dividing rats into separate groups and feeding each group high doses of either a sugar (glucose or fructose) or an artificial sweetener (aspartame or acesulfame potassium) for 3 weeks. They then took blood samples from the rats and found that both sugar and artificial sweeteners affected the concentrations of fat, amino acids, and other biochemicals in their blood. In other words, in just 3 weeks, both sugar and artificial sweeteners seemed to be disrupting the way fats and proteins were being processed.      In a press release, Hoffmann said, \\"Despite the addition of these non-caloric artificial sweeteners to our everyday diets, there has still been a drastic rise in obesity and diabetes. In our studies, both sugar and artificial sweeteners seem to exhibit negative effects linked to obesity and diabetes, albeit through very different mechanisms from each other.\\"      Of course, this was a presentation at a scientific meeting rather than a peer-reviewed publication in a scientific journal. So we'll have to wait until a subsequent publication (assuming that it makes it through the scientific peer-review process for a respectable journal) provides more details about the experiments and results before more rigorously evaluating how well the study was done. Also, as I have said before, there are humans who are rats. But rats are not humans. What happens in a rat may stay in a rat. Meaning that humans may handle artificial sweeteners differently. Moreover, the study showed changes that may be related to eventually developing diabetes but did not yet prove that the rats would develop diabetes. Running the experiment for longer periods of time may help offer better proof. ||||| Photo: CorrieMiracle (Pixabay)      For as long as artificial sweeteners have existed, people have been warned about their supposed health risks such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. But while these claims are routinely debunked as nothing more than junk science, some research—including a new study presented this week at the annual Experimental Biology conference—is beginning to indicate that sweeteners could actually contribute to health problems like type 2 diabetes.      Researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Marquette University used rats vulnerable to developing diabetes for their experiments. For three weeks, different groups were fed high doses of two sugars, glucose and fructose, and two common artificial sweeteners, aspartame and acesulfame potassium. They then studied the rats’ blood using a large-scale technique that tracks minute metabolic changes, known as metabolomics.      Advertisement      “Just after three weeks of giving these sweeteners and sugars to our diabetes-susceptible rats, we saw biochemical changes in the blood that could potentially lead to alterations in fat and energy metabolism,” lead author Brian Hoffman, a biomedical engineer at both institutions, told Gizmodo.      Diabetes is what happens when our bodies become unable to maintain proper glucose levels in the body—a process that’s largely regulated by the hormone insulin. This breakdown causes people to either stop responding to insulin as easily as they once did, or to stop producing insulin altogether. Excessive sugar in our diets is thought to help cause diabetes by overtaxing the body’s insulin-producing machinery, since it’s used to bring high blood glucose levels back to normal.      Because of that, artificial sweeteners have long been advertised as a way for people to eat treats and soft drinks safely and lose weight, without raising the risk of diabetes. But rates of diabetes and obesity have continued to skyrocket regardless, even as sweetener-rich foods and drinks became widely available starting in the 1950s. (There are currently six FDA-approved artificial sweeteners.)      Advertisement      As a result, Hoffman and his team have not only tried to understand how sugar sparks the chain of events that leads to diabetes, but also tried to suss out whether sweeteners could do the same.      If sweeteners can raise our risk of diabetes, Hoffman says, they probably do it differently than sugar. Rather than overwhelming the body’s machinery, his and others’ research suggests, fake sugar wears it out. “Sweeteners kinda trick the body. And then when your body’s not getting the energy it needs—because it does need some sugar to function properly—it potentially finds that source elsewhere,” Hoffman said.      In the rats’ blood, his team found evidence of protein breakdown, likely meaning their bodies turned to burning away muscle as a source of energy. They also found higher levels of lipids and other fats, which over time could contribute to obesity and diabetes. Other research has suggested sweeteners alter the community of bacteria that call our guts home—the microbiome—in a way that could lead to harmful metabolic changes. And still more research has shown that diets high in artificial sweeteners are associated with a greater risk of diabetes and obesity.      Advertisement      Hoffman is well aware of past efforts to tie sweeteners to dire health risks, but he says things are different in this case.      “Most of these sweeteners were approved well before we had the technology to perform studies like my lab is doing. So they weren’t able to look as in-depth at some of the potential effects being caused,” he said. “By knowing what biochemical changes these are causing through these large-scale studies, we can take a unbiased approach and see what’s changing to give us a better direction.”      Hoffman’s team plans to submit their current findings for consideration in several peer-reviewed journals, but they’re already in the middle of studying their sweetener-fed rats for longer periods of time. Future studies are likely to involve taking a peek at the rats’ microbiomes too. Ultimately, he believes their study method could be relatively easy to use with people, since all that would be needed is a blood sample to study small metabolic changes.      Advertisement      In the meantime, though, he doesn’t necessarily want to scare anyone away from their diet drink habit.      “What I like to tell people is that most things in moderation are going to be fine. So if you enjoy your diet soda here and there, than have your diet soda here and there. If you like your normal soda here and there, have it here and there,” he said. “It’s when people start to chronically consume these—say, a person drinks two, three, four of [these drinks] everyday, that we should start to be concerned. Because you’re starting to introduce these biochemical changes and the body has no time to recover.”            [EB 2018]      Update: The American Beverage Association, a trade group that represents the non-alcoholic beverage industry, reached out to Gizmodo after this article was published, and offered this response to the study’s findings:      “Low-calorie sweeteners have been proven safe by worldwide government safety authorities as well as hundreds of scientific studies and there is nothing in this research that counters this well-established fact.” |||||","output":"A recent study has found that zero-calorie artificial sweeteners, which are frequently used in diet and zero-calorie sodas, could have health consequences linked to diabetes and obesity. While past studies have yielded mixed results, this research is the largest yet to track biochemical changes in the body after consuming sugar or artificial sweeteners. The study found that although the body can handle sugar in moderation, overloading the system with either sugar or artificial sweeteners over time led to negative changes in fat and energy metabolism. The study does not definitively answer whether sugar or artificial sweeteners are worse, and further study is needed. The results suggest that moderation is crucial in consumption of both substances. The American Beverage Association, however, maintains that artificial sweeteners have been proven safe. The study was conducted using rats and its results may not translate directly to humans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Police say the pair were on the 12th hole at Westwynd Golf Course in Oakland County near Detroit, Michigan when the duo got into an argument about the score. 59-year-old Glen Lott broke his Callaway 5-iron on the arm of his 65-year-old partner. Lott was arraigned on Friday in Rochester Hills District Court and ordered as part of his 100,000 bond to stay away from the golf course. Deputies recovered the broken half of the 5-iron and found the other half still in Glen Lott's golf bag. They were able to piece together the events leading up to the violent attack. Witnesses had seen the escalating disagreement between Lott and his partner throughout the course of the game, with the culmination at the 12th hole. The heated nature of their argument, rooted in the debate over the score, led to Lott's aggressive act of breaking the club on his partner's arm. In addition to staying away from the golf course, Lott was ordered not to have any contact with his 65-year-old golf partner or any other potential witnesses to the incident. This precaution ensures the safety of everyone involved and allows for an uninterrupted legal process. The Rochester Hills District Court will be handling the trial of this bizarre event. It is likely that they will consider not only the incident itself but also the broader question of sportsmanship and conduct on the golf course. While golf is often seen as a gentleman's game, this incident demonstrates that tempers can boil over, leading to dangerous and violent outcomes. Lott's actions have not only impacted his own life, with the charges and potential consequences he faces, but also the life of his golf partner. Though specifics on the injuries sustained were not disclosed, the stabbing with a broken golf club could have resulted in serious physical harm. The story serves as a chilling reminder that disagreements and arguments on the golf course should be dealt with promptly and calmly, rather than escalating into physical or violent confrontations. Glen Lott's bond amount of 100,000 highlights the severity of the situation, as well as the dramatic nature of breaking a Callaway 5-iron on someone's arm. The story has undoubtedly sent shockwaves through the golfing community, causing many to reconsider how they handle disputes on the course and urging them to maintain respect for their fellow players and the game of golf itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Spread Movie plot: The Spread world premiere has been announced for Saturday, January 17 at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.Set in modern day Los Angeles, Spread is a hard biting story about a high-end lothario, Nikki (Ashton Kutcher), who has slept his way into a life of privilege. He shares his secrets with us as he hosts parties and beds scores of women, all while living it up at the Hollywood Hills home of a middle-aged female attorney, Samantha (Anne Heche). Everything is going swimmingly until Nikki meets a gorgeous waitress named Heather (Margarita Levieva), who, unbeknownst to him, is playing the same game that he is. As the truth of their life unravels, they find themselves sexually charged by a game of one-upmanship that has them dining at fine restaurants and crashing posh parties, until the truth of their lives forces them to choose between love and money. Inspired by classics like Shampoo, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and American Gigolo, Spread profiles a sexual grifter and his prey.Los Angeles serves as a character unto its own in this film, providing slick and luxurious backdrops during Nikki's high times, and seedy, fleabag motels when Nikki has nowhere else to turn. Nikki runs the gambit of Hollywood dreams and nightmares. The supporting cast comprises gorgeous women like Emily (Rachel Blanchard), who is drawn in by Nikki's good looks and charm but is left feeling cold and used. Nikki's best friend, Harry (Sebastian Stan), struggles with their co-dependant relationship, always needing to bail Nikki out when he runs out of women to depend on.Directed by David Mackenzie (Hallam Foe, Young Adam), Spread is an iconic look at the lure of sex, money, and access that Hollywood offers to the beautiful people, and the karmic price that Nikki must ultimately pay to live that lifestyle.

Given the question: Process:  - An enzyme in saliva begins to break down carbohydrates - Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow - Acid and enzyme in the stomach break the food down - Releases nutrients - Food then pumped into small intestine - Fluid and enzymes from liver and pancreas pumped into small intestine - Help break food into smallest molecules - Nutrients pass through wall of small intestine - Nutrients absorbed into blood stream - Unused materials passed into large intestine to become fecal matter.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose person is on a diet happens, how will it affect less food being broken down.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a person being on a diet can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of food digestion and nutrient absorption. Direct effects: 1. Reduced food intake: When a person is on a diet, they typically consume fewer calories and smaller portions of food. As a result, the overall mass and volume of food being broken down during the digestive process will be reduced. This means that the enzymes, acids, and other compounds involved in breaking down the food will have less substrate to work on, potentially leading to a decrease in their overall function and efficiency. 2. Altered nutrient balance: A diet can also affect the nutrient composition of the food being consumed. For example, a person on a low-carbohydrate diet will have fewer carbohydrates for the enzyme in saliva (amylase) to break down. Similarly, a low-fat diet will provide fewer triglycerides for pancreatic lipase to break down. The body may adapt to these changes in nutrient availability by altering the production and secretion of specific digestive enzymes. Indirect effects: 1. Hormonal regulation: The hormones that regulate digestion and appetite can also be affected by a diet. For example, a diet-induced reduction in body fat can lead to changes in the levels of hormones such as leptin and ghrelin, which influence hunger and satiety signals. These hormonal changes can further impact the overall digestive process by affecting the secretion of digestive enzymes and the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. 2. Gut microbiota alterations: Dietary changes can also impact the composition and activity of the gut microbiota – the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract. These microbes play a crucial role in digestive processes, such as the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids. A significant shift in the composition of the gut microbiota due to dietary changes could affect the overall efficiency of the digestive process. In conclusion, a person being on a diet can have both direct and indirect effects on the digestive process due to the reduced food intake, altered nutrient balance, changes in hormonal regulation, and alterations in the gut microbiota. Adaptations may occur over time, but the initial stages of dietary changes may impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the digestive process."},{"instruction":"SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

I know many hard - working FinAid officers who try to balance the need of the student with the need of the school . Putting together a program that is attractive enough without giving it all away is a challenge . The problem is the image colleges have created that the admissions and financial aid system is mechanical and \\" blind \\" . That only the \\" best \\" get in when in reality it is the \\" best \\" of what kind of student they need . Answer the following question: What may happen before a FinAid officer decided on financial aid for students ?","output":"Before a FinAid officer decides on financial aid for students, several steps and considerations are taken into account to ensure that the appropriate financial aid package is awarded to eligible students. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process: Step 1: Application Review The FinAid officer will first review the student's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or other financial aid forms submitted by the student. This helps the officer to assess the student's financial need and eligibility for different types of aid. Step 2: Determine Financial Need By evaluating the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC), cost of attendance, and other financial resources available to the student, the FinAid officer will determine the student's financial need. Step 3: Assess Academic Performance The FinAid officer will also consider the student's academic performance, such as grade point average (GPA), standardized test scores, and other achievements, to potentially offer merit-based aid. Step 4: Consider Other Factors Depending on the institution and its criteria, a FinAid officer may take various other factors into account, like the student's background, extracurricular activities, leadership, or specific talents, that can influence the aid decision. Step 5: Balance School's Goals and Resources In this step, the officer will try to balance the financial aid program's attractiveness with the school’s budget constraints and enrollment goals. They may also consider the school's priorities, such as maintaining a diverse student body or attracting students with particular skills or interests. Step 6: Create a Financial Aid Package Taking all the factors into account, the FinAid officer will assemble a personalized financial aid package for the student, which may include a combination of grants, scholarships, work-study, and loans. Step 7: Communicate the Offer Finally, the FinAid officer will send the financial aid offer to the student, outlining the types and amounts of financial aid available. At this point, the student can review, accept, or decline the offer, or negotiate for additional assistance if needed. In conclusion, several factors and considerations are taken into account before a FinAid officer decides on financial aid for students. The process is not entirely mechanical or \\"blind,\\" and factors such as a student's financial need, academic performance, and the school's goals and resources play a significant role in determining a student's financial aid package."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Process:  - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning.  suppose there is more ice that inside the clouds happens, how will it affect LESS or LESS POWERFUL lightning.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. Explanation: If there is more ice inside the cloud, it could lead to an increase in the intensity and frequency of the collisions between ice particles, causing more electrostatic charges to develop within the cloud. This increased electrostatic charge could contribute to creating a stronger negative charge within the thundercloud. Consequently, this change could lead to more powerful lightning strikes due to the higher potential difference between the negative charge in the cloud and the positive charge on the ground. Although the presence of more ice does not directly affect the formation of lightning, it indirectly impacts the amount of electrostatic energy buildup within the thundercloud."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Comic shops are constantly adding new books to their inventory, and will have plenty of books to peruse while you decide what to read. Physical comics have the advantage of always being readable, even when your Internet is down. They also make it easier to display and show off your collection as it grows. Make sure you have adequate shelving or other storage space (boxes and/or bins) before you start collecting physical comics. Digital comics are easier to store, since they can all be found in one place. They are ideal if you don’t have a lot of space to keep physical comics, or just want to keep your collection organized as easily as possible.  Consider buying digital copies of comics to read, then buying print editions of your favorite stories to give the creators extra support.  You don’t have to choose one or the other. Plenty of comic fans have both digital and print copies of their favorite comics. Several printed comics also give digital copies of the same issues to buyers at no extra charge. Comics are collectible items. While you buy them to read them, you want to preserve them so you can keep reading them years down the road. Keep them on shelves like you would normal books, but tuck them into special sleeves to keep them from yellowing. They will be made from plastic, and can be opened and closed with tape.  Some comics come with special collector’s boxes, which are great for protection and will look amazing on your shelves!  You won’t have this problem with digital comics, naturally—though you may want to back them up on separate cloud storage (like Dropbox or Google Drive), just in case something happens to your device or current cloud service. The comic book world loves to indulge fans with free issues! Take advantage of these giveaways to start reading your first comic and build your new collection.

They eat, wear, go and talk too much. _  Your house of life ought to be a mansion   , a royal palace.  Every new taste, every additional interest, every fresh enthusiasm adds a room.  Here are several rooms your house of life should have. Art should be a desire for you to develop simply because the world is full of beautiful things.

Please answer a question about the following article about Religion in ancient Rome: Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors. How were Augustus's reforms viewed?","output":"Augustus's reforms were primarily viewed as adaptive, restorative, and regulatory in nature, rather than innovative. As a leader in ancient Rome, Augustus sought to maintain the stability and continuity of existing religious and social traditions, while also addressing any issues and discrepancies that may have arisen during his time. There were several aspects of Augustus's reforms that were designed to preserve and restore traditional aspects of ancient Roman religion. One notable example of this was his promotion and elevation of the ancient Arvales, an important priestly brotherhood tasked with conducting various religious rites and ceremonies. By reinforcing the significance of the Arvales in the Roman religious landscape, Augustus signaled his commitment to upholding longstanding religious customs and practices. Another key example of Augustus's restorative approach was his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia festival shortly before his election. The Compitalia was a religious event celebrated at the crossroads of Rome by plebeians, who made offerings to the guardian spirits of their local neighborhood. By actively promoting this traditional festival, Augustus demonstrated his support for both the religious and social aspects of plebeian life, thus emphasizing his connection with the broader Roman populace. Additionally, Augustus's patronage of the Vestal Virgins played a significant role in his restorative efforts. The Vestal Virgins were priestesses responsible for maintaining the sacred fire of Vesta, and their roles involved upholding morality in Roman society. By supporting the Vestals and bolstering their importance in the public eye, Augustus sought to promote the values of morality and integrity throughout ancient Rome. Augustus also acquired numerous prestigious priesthoods, including that of the pontifex maximus, the high priest of the Roman state religion. These roles had originally held significant religious importance, but towards the end of the Republic, they became closely intertwined with political offices. By taking on these positions, Augustus aimed to consolidate his authority and ensure continuity within both the religious and political spheres. One of the critical aspects of Augustus's religious policies was his commitment to maintaining the pax deorum, or the divine peace, which he achieved during his reign. He made it a priority to ensure harmonious relationships between the Romans and their gods and took steps to secure an appropriate successor who could continue this policy. In summary, Augustus's reforms in the religious sphere of ancient Rome were not marked by groundbreaking innovations; rather, they focused on maintaining and reviving traditional practices and rituals that had been part of Roman religious life for centuries. By taking such an approach, he successfully restored and preserved key aspects of Rome's religious foundations, while reinforcing his own authority and demonstrating his commitment to the well-being of the society he led."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Ismail Belghar attacked his wife's sister, slapping her across the face, calling her a 'slut' and holding her over a car park railing when he noticed his wife Hanife Kokden had 'slightly sunburned shoulders'. The Moroccan immigrant is alleged to have assaulted his sister-in-law in New South Wales, Australia, after becoming infuriated that his wife had 'displayed her body' on a beach. The trial was due to start this week, but Belghar avoided having the case heard by a jury when the attempted murder charge was dropped and he pleaded guilty to detaining Miss","output":"Kokden's sister for advantage, as well as assault occasioning actual bodily harm. As the trial came to an end, Judge Stevenson listened to the defense and prosecution's arguments. The prosecution argued that Belghar's actions were a clear display of controlling behavior and violence, which had a significant impact on his sister-in-law's mental and physical well-being. They urged the judge to impose a harsh sentence to send a strong message against domestic violence. The defense, on the other hand, presented Belghar as a man who deeply regretted his actions and was willing to undergo counseling to address his understanding of cultural differences and anger management issues. They requested leniency on the basis of his guilty plea and willingness to change. After considering both arguments, Judge Stevenson decided to sentence Belghar to three years in prison, with the possibility of parole after serving 18 months. In her statement, she acknowledged the gravity of his actions but also took into account his remorse and commitment to change his behavior. Belghar's wife, Hanife Kokden, filed for divorce shortly after the trial, seeking to distance herself and her family from the abusive situation. Her sister, the victim of the assault, eventually began to recover from the traumatic experience but remained deeply affected by the events. As for Ismail Belghar, his time in prison provided him with an opportunity to reflect on his actions and attend counseling sessions. After serving his sentence, he was granted parole and attempted to reintegrate into society while respecting the conditions of his release. Public reaction to the case sparked a broader conversation about issues of domestic violence, cultural differences, and the importance of respecting individual freedoms, leading to increased community awareness and support for victims of domestic abuse. In the end, the story served as a reminder that acts of violence and control are never justifiable and that seeking help and understanding through education and counseling can be an important step towards change and healing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cute shop, friendly staff (although still not \\"smooth\\" operation due to being new-the ladies were a little scattered.).  But on to the important part: the cupcakes. Good rotating menu. I've tried:  Wedding Cake (plain choice to judge the pure cupcake quality)    Very good-exactly what I would want out of a plain white cake. Moist without being too moist. I think some people like REALLY moist cake/cupcakes-I prefer mine to have structure without being dry and these fit the bill perfectly. The buttercream was good, but I really wish they didn't pile it on quite so high. I cut half mine off. What a waste.  Caramel Apple   This was WAAAAAAY too heavy for me. Did not like this. The cream cheese frosting was exceedingly heavy and the raisins were an odd addition. No caramel apple I've ever eaten has raisins. Again, cut half the frosting off. It's not a deal breaker for me, I just think they could at least cut it down by 1/4 and still make frosting-a-holics happy.  Chocolate Salted Caramel   This will be a \\"go to\\" cupcake for me!  Ridiculously good. The frosting is \\"shorter\\" than the other cupcakes, too, which pleases me. Drool inducing.  At 3 each, for the large size of both the cake and frosting, this is a decent deal in Madison. While you are there, head to David Bacco, now \\"DB Infusions\\" and grab some chocolates for someone you love. Available choices: -- negative. -- positive.","output":"The sentiment of the review appears to be mostly positive. The reviewer appreciates the cute shop and friendly staff, although they mention the operation could be smoother. They enjoy the rotating menu of cupcakes and give a detailed account of their experience with three specific flavors. The Wedding Cake cupcake seems to be well-liked by the reviewer as it fits their preference for consistency and taste. The only issue they have is with the amount of buttercream frosting, which they feel is too much. However, this doesn't seem to greatly impact their overall enjoyment. The Caramel Apple cupcake receives a negative review due to its heaviness and the odd addition of raisins. The reviewer also comments on the excessive frosting, which they removed to improve their experience. Despite disliking this cupcake, it isn't described as a deal-breaker. The reviewer's favorite cupcake seems to be the Chocolate Salted Caramel, which they praise as ridiculously good and drool-inducing. The frosting on this cupcake is also more satisfactory to the reviewer. Lastly, the reviewer considers the price of 3 per cupcake to be a decent deal in Madison. They also provide a positive recommendation for another local business. Overall, the sentiment of this review leans towards positive, with some minor criticisms that don't negate their overall enjoyment of the shop and its offerings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","output":"Based on the given review, I would recommend this app with a \\"Maybe\\" to a friend. The reason for this recommendation is as follows: 1. Negative Feedback: The reviewer states that the app made their speaker buttons stop working, which indicates a possible compatibility issue or malfunction resulting from the app's installation. This is a concerning issue, as it could potentially hamper a user's experience by affecting a critical functionality on their device. 2. Problem Resolution: Despite the mentioned problem, it is important to note that the reviewer was able to figure out the issue and presumably find a solution. This might indicate that the issue encountered could be a rare occurrence, or that the app could provide some benefits that are worth trying despite the possible risks. 3. Lack of Context: Since there's limited information provided beyond a single review, it's challenging to fully understand the app's performance and user experience. A single review is not representative of the overall app quality, as other users might have different experiences and feedback. Also, we do not know the type of the app, its purpose, and its competitors. 4. Further Evaluation: It would be recommended to seek out more reviews and information about the app from other sources like app store ratings, review websites, or personal recommendations from friends. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the app's performance, user experience, and potential issues before making a recommendation. In conclusion, based on the given review and considering the factors mentioned above, I would recommend this app with a \\"Maybe\\" to a friend. It is crucial to acknowledge the potential issue related to speaker buttons but not neglect the fact that the problem was resolved by the reviewer. Further evaluation through more reviews and personal experience with the app could also help arrive at a clearer recommendation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:In a police recording, Anton Duffy, 39, said he asked Anthony Stokes in Glasgow's Brazen Head pub to get his father to speak to someone about guns. The High Court in Glasgow heard pub regulars reacted furiously to this. Mr Duffy, John Gorman, 58, Paul Sands, 31 and Martin Hughes, 36, deny plotting to kill Johnny Adair and Sam McCrory. The High Court in Glasgow has already heard that Mr Adair and his best friend Mr McCrory were both former members of prohibited Loyalist terror organisations the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and its paramilitary wing the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). They were involved in the Good Friday agreement in 1998 which brought peace to Northern Ireland, and both have been living in Ayrshire for a number of years. The trial has also been told that the accused were recorded by police during surveillance operations. Mr Duffy's home in Old Castle Road, Glasgow, was bugged by police from August to October 2013. One conversation was recorded after he returned from the Brazen Head pub in the city's Gorbals area on 1 September 2013 . In a tape played to the jury of 10 women and five men, Mr Duffy is heard to say: \\"I wanted to go and talk to Anthony Stokes and see if his dad could get a message to Donzo about these...weapons. \\"I seen Anthony Stokes tonight and I says listen, I need to talk to your dad and then everybody started jumping in going uh blah, blah, blah, know what I mean. \\"They're singing songs and all this carry on saying you can't do this. I said leave me alone. Not one of them has ever had to go on an operation where they got shot.\\" Det Con Ross Arnott, who was involved in the surveillance operation, was asked by QC Derek Ogg, defending Mr Duffy: \\"We heard how Mr Duffy approached Anthony Stokes the Celtic footballer and was angry when there was a big reaction. \\"He approached Anthony Stokes to ask if he could speak to his dad to speak to somebody else about guns and everyone seemed to take exception to this?\\" and DC Arnott replied: \\"Yes.\\" Mr Ogg then said: \\"Throughout the tapes we hear Mr Duffy refer to his crazy behaviour and taking Tramadol,\\" and DC Arnott  replied: \\"That's correct.\\" The court heard that police recorded 1,300 hours of covert tapes during the operation codenamed Operation Hairsplitter. Mr Ogg revealed that initially all the excepts from the tapes given to defence teams excluded any reference to Duffy's addiction to Tramadol. The QC said to DC Arnott: \\"Originally, the security services did not wish to release to us any recordings with references to Tramadol and my client's addiction to it, why was this?\\" The police officer said: \\"The decision was made by senior officers that the information originally released was sufficient for disclosure purposes.\\" The jury heard that in the tapes finally released there were numerous references to Mr Duffy being sick due to Tramodol. It is also claimed Mr Duffy and Mr Gorman were allegedly part of a plan to murder the governor of Barlinnie jail Derek McGill in a car bomb attack. Three other men - Craig Convery, 37, Gary Convery, 34, and Gordon Brown, 29 - deny organised crime charges. The trial before judge Lady Scott continues.

Two days after the events of the first film, a traumatized and blood-covered Sarah escapes the cave with no memory of the events. She is taken to a hospital, where it is found that some of the blood on her belongs to Juno Kaplan. Sheriff Vaines takes his deputy Elen Rios, Sarah, and three spelunking specialists – Dan, Greg, and Cath – to the cave to find the missing women. The team members are sent down via an old mine shaft operated by the old, mysterious Ed Oswald. The group discovers Rebecca's mutilated body, causing Sarah to have flashbacks of the crawlers and causing Vaines to believe Sarah may be responsible for the girls' disappearance.  While crawling through a tunnel, she attacks Vaines and the others, causing the others to split up. Vaines runs to search for Sarah, and in the process is surprised by a crawler, and fires his gun in a panic, causing a minor collapse in the cavern which traps Cath, separating her from Rios, Dan, and Greg.  The three decide to find an alternate way around in order to try to free Cath and arrive in a room full of bones, where they find Holly's video camera. They watch it and realize the women were attacked by the crawlers. The three are then themselves attacked by crawlers and separated. Rios starts calling for help, alerting the crawlers to her location, but is rescued by Sarah.  The two then watch as a crawler kills Dan and drags his body away, prompting Sarah to inform Rios that the crawlers are blind and hunt via sound. After escaping from and killing a crawler, Cath finds Greg before the two escape from another crawler and find Sam's body.

The California State Legislature was debating a bill to ban the therapy outright as being dangerous. A magazine writer who had been through the therapy as a teenager recently visited his house, to explain how miserably disorienting the experience was.      And he would later learn that a World Health Organization report, released on Thursday, calls the therapy “a serious threat to the health and well-being — even the lives — of affected people.”      Dr. Spitzer’s fingers jerked over the keys, unreliably, as if choking on the words. And then it was done: a short letter to be published this month, in the same journal where the original study appeared.      “I believe,” it concludes, “I owe the gay community an apology.”      Disturber of the Peace      The idea to study reparative therapy at all was pure Spitzer, say those who know him, an effort to stick a finger in the eye of an orthodoxy that he himself had helped establish.      In the late 1990s as today, the psychiatric establishment considered the therapy to be a nonstarter. Few therapists thought of homosexuality as a disorder.      It was not always so. Up into the 1970s, the field’s diagnostic manual classified homosexuality as an illness, calling it a “ sociopathic personality disturbance.” Many therapists offered treatment, including Freudian analysts who dominated the field at the time.      Advocates for gay people objected furiously, and in 1970, one year after the landmark Stonewall protests to stop police raids at a New York bar, a team of gay rights protesters heckled a meeting of behavioral therapists in New York to discuss the topic. The meeting broke up, but not before a young Columbia University professor sat down with the protesters to hear their case.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “I’ve always been drawn to controversy, and what I was hearing made sense,” said Dr. Spitzer, in an interview at his Princeton home last week. “And I began to think, well, if it is a mental disorder, then what makes it one?”      He compared homosexuality with other conditions defined as disorders, like depression and alcohol dependence , and saw immediately that the latter caused marked distress or impairment, while homosexuality often did not.      He also saw an opportunity to do something about it. Dr. Spitzer was then a junior member of on an American Psychiatric Association committee helping to rewrite the field’s diagnostic manual, and he promptly organized a symposium to discuss the place of homosexuality.      That kicked off a series of bitter debates, pitting Dr. Spitzer against a pair of influential senior psychiatrists who would not budge. In the end, the psychiatric association in 1973 sided with Dr. Spitzer, deciding to drop homosexuality from its manual and replace it with his alternative, “sexual orientation disturbance,” to identify people whose sexual orientation, gay or straight, caused them distress.      The arcane language notwithstanding, homosexuality was no longer a “disorder.” Dr. Spitzer achieved a civil rights breakthrough in record time.      “I wouldn’t say that Robert Spitzer became a household name among the broader gay movement, but the declassification of homosexuality was widely celebrated as a victory,” said Ronald Bayer of the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia. “ ‘Sick No More’ was a headline in some gay newspapers.”      Partly as a result, Dr. Spitzer took charge of the task of updating the diagnostic manual. Together with a colleague, Dr. Janet Williams, now his wife, he set to work. To an extent that is still not widely appreciated, his thinking about this one issue — homosexuality — drove a broader reconsideration of what mental illness is, of where to draw the line between normal and not.      The new manual, a 567-page doorstop released in 1980, became an unlikely best seller, here and abroad. It instantly set the standard for future psychiatry manuals, and elevated its principal architect, then nearing 50, to the pinnacle of his field.

He took to the role as if born to it, colleagues say, helping to bring order to a historically chaotic corner of science.      But power was its own kind of confinement. Dr. Spitzer could still disturb the peace, all right, but no longer from the flanks, as a rebel. Now he was the establishment. And in the late 1990s, friends say, he remained restless as ever, eager to challenge common assumptions.      That’s when he ran into another group of protesters, at the psychiatric association’s annual meeting in 1999: self-described ex-gays. Like the homosexual protesters in 1973, they too were outraged that psychiatry was denying their experience — and any therapy that might help.      Reparative Therapy      Reparative therapy, sometimes called “sexual reorientation” or “conversion” therapy, is rooted in Freud’s idea that people are born bisexual and can move along a continuum from one end to the other. Some therapists never let go of the theory, and one of Dr. Spitzer’s main rivals in the 1973 debate, Dr. Charles W. Socarides, founded an organization called the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, or Narth, in Southern California , to promote it.      Photo      By 1998, Narth had formed alliances with socially conservative advocacy groups and together they began an aggressive campaign, taking out full-page ads in major newspaper trumpeting success stories.      “People with a shared worldview basically came together and created their own set of experts to offer alternative policy views,” said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and co-editor of “Ex-Gay Research: Analyzing the Spitzer Study and Its Relation to Science, Religion, Politics, and Culture.”      To Dr. Spitzer, the scientific question was at least worth asking: What was the effect of the therapy, if any? Previous studies had been biased and inconclusive. “People at the time did say to me, ‘Bob, you’re messing with your career, don’t do it,’ ” Dr. Spitzer said. “But I just didn’t feel vulnerable.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He recruited 200 men and women, from the centers that were performing the therapy, including Exodus International, based in Florida , and Narth. He interviewed each in depth over the phone, asking about their sexual urges, feelings and behaviors before and after having the therapy, rating the answers on a scale.      He then compared the scores on this questionnaire, before and after therapy. “The majority of participants gave reports of change from a predominantly or exclusively homosexual orientation before therapy to a predominantly or exclusively heterosexual orientation in the past year,” his paper concluded.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The study — presented at a psychiatry meeting in 2001, before publication — immediately created a sensation, and ex-gay groups seized on it as solid evidence for their case. This was Dr. Spitzer, after all, the man who single-handedly removed homosexuality from the manual of mental disorders. No one could accuse him of bias.      But gay leaders accused him of betrayal, and they had their reasons.      The study had serious problems. It was based on what people remembered feeling years before — an often fuzzy record. It included some ex-gay advocates, who were politically active. And it did not test any particular therapy; only half of the participants engaged with a therapist at all, while the others worked with pastoral counselors, or in independent Bible study.      Several colleagues tried to stop the study in its tracks, and urged him not to publish it, Dr. Spitzer said.      Yet, heavily invested after all the work, he turned to a friend and former collaborator, Dr. Kenneth J. Zucker, psychologist in chief at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto and editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior, another influential journal.      “I knew Bob and the quality of his work, and I agreed to publish it,” Dr. Zucker said in an interview last week. The paper did not go through the usual peer-review process, in which unnamed experts critique a manuscript before publication. “But I told him I would do it only if I also published commentaries” of response from other scientists to accompany the study, Dr. Zucker said.      Those commentaries, with a few exceptions, were merciless. One cited the Nuremberg Code of ethics to denounce the study as not only flawed but morally wrong. “We fear the repercussions of this study, including an increase in suffering, prejudice, and discrimination,” concluded a group of 15 researchers at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, where Dr. Spitzer was affiliated.      Dr. Spitzer in no way implied in the study that being gay was a choice, or that it was possible for anyone who wanted to change to do so in therapy. But that didn’t stop socially conservative groups from citing the paper in support of just those points, according to Wayne Besen, executive director of Truth Wins Out, a nonprofit group that fights antigay bias.      On one occasion, a politician in Finland held up the study in Parliament to argue against civil unions, according to Dr. Drescher.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “It needs to be said that when this study was misused for political purposes to say that gays should be cured — as it was, many times — Bob responded immediately, to correct misperceptions,” said Dr. Drescher, who is gay.      But Dr. Spitzer could not control how his study was interpreted by everyone, and he could not erase the biggest scientific flaw of them all, roundly attacked in many of the commentaries: Simply asking people whether they have changed is no evidence at all of real change. People lie, to themselves and others. They continually change their stories, to suit their needs and moods.      By almost any measure, in short, the study failed the test of scientific rigor that Dr. Spitzer himself was so instrumental in enforcing for so many years.      “As I read these commentaries, I knew this was a problem, a big problem, and one I couldn’t answer,” Dr. Spitzer said. “How do you know someone has really changed?”      Letting Go      It took 11 years for him to admit it publicly.      At first he clung to the idea that the study was exploratory, an attempt to prompt scientists to think twice about dismissing the therapy outright. Then he took refuge in the position that the study was focused less on the effectiveness of the therapy and more on how people engaging in it described changes in sexual orientation.      “Not a very interesting question,” he said. “But for a long time I thought maybe I wouldn’t have to face the bigger problem, about measuring change.”      After retiring in 2003, he remained active on many fronts, but the reparative study remained a staple of the culture wars and a personal regret that wouldn’t leave him be. The Parkinson’s symptoms have worsened in the past year, exhausting him mentally as well as physically, making it still harder to fight back pangs of remorse.      And one day in March, Dr. Spitzer entertained a visitor. Gabriel Arana, a journalist at the magazine The American Prospect, interviewed Dr. Spitzer about the reparative therapy study. This was not just any interview; Mr. Arana went through reparative therapy himself as a teenager, and his therapist had recruited the young man for Dr. Spitzer’s study (Mr. Arana did not participate).      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “I asked him about all his critics, and he just came out and said, ‘I think they’re largely correct,’ ” said Mr. Arana, who wrote about his own experience last month. Mr. Arana said that reparative therapy ultimately delayed his self-acceptance as a gay man and induced thoughts of suicide. “But at the time I was recruited for the Spitzer study, I was referred as a success story. I would have said I was making progress.”      That did it. The study that seemed at the time a mere footnote to a large life was growing into a chapter. And it needed a proper ending — a strong correction, directly from its author, not a journalist or colleague.      A draft of the letter has already leaked online and has been reported.      “You know, it’s the only regret I have; the only professional one,” Dr. Spitzer said of the study, near the end of a long interview. “And I think, in the history of psychiatry, I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a scientist write a letter saying that the data were all there but were totally misinterpreted. Who admitted that and who apologized to his readers.”      He looked away and back again, his big eyes blurring with emotion. “That’s something, don’t you think?” ||||| One of the most influential figures in modern psychiatry has apologised to America's gays for a scientific study which supported attempts to \\"cure\\" people of their homosexuality.      The survey, published in 2001, looked at \\"reparative therapy\\" and was hailed by religious and social conservatives in America as proof that gay people could successfully become straight if they were motivated to do so.      But Dr Robert Spitzer has now apologised in the same academic journal that published his original study, calling it \\"fatally flawed\\". \\"I believe I owe the gay community an apology,\\" his letter said. \\"I also apologise to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works.\\"      Spitzer's letter, which was leaked online before its publication in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour, is sure to cause delight among gay civil rights groups and stir up anger among social conservatives, who have used the study to combat the acceptance of homosexuality as a normal part of human society.      Reparative therapy is popular among Christian conservative groups, which run clinics and therapy sessions at which people try to become heterosexual through counselling. Gay rights activists condemn such practices as motivated by religious faith, not science, and call them \\"pray away the gay\\" groups.      Spitzer's study looked at the experiences of 200 people undertaking the therapy, including subjects that had been provided by religious groups. He then asked each person the same set of questions, analysing their responses to the therapy and their feelings and sexual urges afterwards. He concluded that many of them reported feelings of changes in their sexual desires from homosexual to heterosexual.      Spitzer's stance was notorious, because in 1973 he had been instrumental in getting the American Psychiatric Association to stop classifying homosexuality as a mental disorder in its diagnostic manual: a move seen at the time as a major victory for gay rights.      His 2001 study caused a huge stir because many people felt that it was not rigorous enough for publication. The central criticism was that Spitzer had not paid enough attention to the fact that subjects might lie about their feelings or be engaged in self-deception.      For more than a decade Spitzer shrugged off the attacks and stood by his work, but he has now admitted that his critics were right. \\"I offered several (unconvincing) reasons why it was reasonable to assume that the subject's reports of change were credible and not self-deception or outright lying. But the simple fact is that there was no way to determine if the subject's accounts of change were valid,\\" Spitzer wrote.      In an interview with the New York Times last week, Spitzer, who is 79 and suffers from Parkinson's disease, described how he had written his letter of recantation in the middle of the night after agonising over the study's impact.      He had also recently been visited by a gay magazine journalist, Gabriel Arana, who had described to him his own experience going through reparation therapy and how damaging it had been and how it had led to thoughts of suicide. \\"It's the only regret I have; the only professional one,\\" Spitzer told the New York Times, which described him as being almost in tears as he talked about his decision to admit he was wrong.      \\"In the history of psychiatry I don't know that I've ever seen a scientist write a letter saying that the data were all there but were totally misinterpreted. Who admitted that and who apologised to his readers. That's something, don't you think?\\" Spitzer told the newspaper.      Gay rights group Truth Wins Out published the full text of the letter on its website and hailed the moment as a major step forward. \\"Spitzer's apology to the victims of 'pray away the gay' therapy … marks a watershed moment in the fight against the 'ex-gay' myth,\\" the group said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In 2001, Dr. Robert Spitzer, a prominent figure in modern psychiatry, published a study on \\"reparative therapy\\" for homosexuality, which was used by religious and social conservatives as evidence that gay individuals could successfully change to heterosexual through counseling. The study faced criticism for not being rigorous enough and for relying on potentially unreliable self-reported accounts. Dr. Spitzer has now apologized for the study, referring to it as \\"fatally flawed\\" and expressing regret about potential harm caused to gay individuals who believed the therapy could work based on his study. In his apology letter published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour, he acknowledged that there was no way to determine the validity of the subjects' accounts of change and expressed apology to the gay community and those who underwent reparative therapy due to the study's claims."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When John Milton, writer of \\"Paradise Lost\\", entered Cambridge University, in 1625, he was already skilled in Latin after seven years of studying it as his second language at St. Paul's School, prefix = st1 /London. Like all English boys who prepared for college in grammar schools, he had learned not only to read Latin but also to speak and write it smoothly and correctly. His pronunciation of Latin was English, however, and seemed to have sounded strange to his friends when he later visitedItaly.   Schoolboys gained their skill in Latin in a bitter way. They kept in mind the rules to make learning by heart easier. They first made a word-for-word translation and then an idiomatic translation into English. As they increased their skill, they translated their English back into Latin without referring to the book and then compared their translation with the original. The schoolmaster was always at hand to encourage them. All schoolmasters believed  _ .   After several years of study, the boys began to write compositions in imitation  of the Latin writers they read. And as they began to read Latin poems, they began to write poems in Latin. Because Miltonwas already a poet at ten, his poems were much better than those painfully put together by the other boys. During the seven yearsMiltonspent at university, he made regular use of his command of Latin. He wrote some excellent Latin poems, which he published among his works in 1645.

Which friend drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics?  Manny and Annie were two foodie friends. Manny was a health conscious person, he ate organic foods and drank organic milk only. Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not.  Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. Answer:","output":"Manny drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics. As a health-conscious person, he consumed only organic foods and organic milk. Organic milk is produced with strict regulations on the use of antibiotics and chemicals, which results in fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens on organic farms. This indicates that the milk he consumed came from cows that were not treated with antibiotics as a preventive measure, adhering to the guidelines of organic food production. On the other hand, Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not, implying that she might have consumed milk from cows treated with antibiotics as she didn't limit her choices to only organic products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Beginning in September 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will require larger, more prominent cigarette health warnings on all cigarette packaging and advertisements in the United States. These warnings are a significant advancement in communicating the dangers of smoking. These new cigarette health warnings contains nine different warnings that will increase awareness of the specific health risks associated with smoking, such as death, addiction, lung disease, cancer, stroke and heart disease. These warnings include:  and the situation: Marcy and Nancy are coworkers at the local library. They get along well and have similar interests. One of the few things they don't have in common though is that Nancy loves to smoke cigarettes, but Marcy can't stand smoking and never does it. Nancy is courteous though and tries not to smoke when she is around Marcy since she knows it bothers her.  Answer the following question: Who is less likely to have a stroke? Answer:","output":"Marcy is less likely to have a stroke compared to Nancy because she does not engage in smoking. Studies have shown that smoking increases the risk of stroke, as the chemicals in tobacco smoke can damage blood vessels and make blood more likely to clot, which can lead to stroke. The new cigarette health warnings that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires on all cigarette packaging and advertisements include warnings about specific health risks associated with smoking, such as stroke and heart disease. Since Nancy is a smoker and Marcy is not, the risks for conditions like stroke are higher for Nancy than for Marcy. It is worth noting that although Nancy is courteous and tries not to smoke when she is around Marcy, this conscious effort to limit her smoking around others does not completely remove the health risks associated with smoking. Smoking cessation has the most significant effect on reducing the risk of stroke and other health issues related to smoking. Additionally, Marcy's decision to not smoke at all further reduces her chances of developing smoking-related health problems, such as stroke. It is essential to recognize that numerous factors can contribute to an individual's risk of having a stroke, including age, family history, lifestyle, and pre-existing medical conditions. Although smoking is a major risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, it is not the only factor to consider when determining an individual's risk profile. However, based on the information provided and considering smoking as a significant contributing factor to the risk of stroke, Marcy is less likely to have a stroke compared to Nancy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His mother's name was Zubeidaa (Karisma Kapoor) and she was the only daughter of a filmmaker named Suleman Seth (Amrish Puri). Zubeidaa acts in films secretly, but when her father finds out he forbids her to carry on and quickly arranges her marriage to Mehboob Alam (Vinod Sharawat). Things seem happy for her when she gives birth to Riyaz. However, a disagreement arises between Suleman and Mehboob's father, and Mehboob divorces Zubeidaa few days after she gives birth.

Nevertheless, he falls in love with Zubeidaa and they get married, but there is continuous turmoil in their relationship. Riyaz learns through Zubeidaa's journal that though she loved Vijayendra dearly, she was unable to follow the stifling customs of the palace. She was also uncomfortable because of her brother-in-law Uday Singh's sexual advances towards her, and his demands of her to have an extra-marital affair with him. Riyaz travels to Fatehpur and asks many people about his mother.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Humans and many other mammals have unusually efficient internal temperature regulating systems that automatically maintain stable core body temperatures in cold winters and warm summers. In addition, people have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them adjust to extremes of temperature and humidity . In very cold climates, there is a constant danger of developing hypothermia , which is a life threatening drop in core body temperature to below normal levels. The normal temperature for humans is about 37.0degC. However, differences in persons and even the time of day can cause it to be as much as 6degC higher or lower in healthy individuals. It is also normal for core body temperature to be lower in elderly people. Hypothermia begins to occur when the core body temperature drops to 34.4degC. Below 29.4degC, the body cools more rapidly because its natural temperature regulating system usually fails. The rapid decline in core body temperature is likely to result in death. However, there have been rare cases in which people have been saved after their temperatures had dropped to 13.9-15.6degC. This happened in 1999 to a Swedish woman who was trapped under an ice sheet in freezing water for 80 minutes. She was found unconscious, not breathing, and her heart had stopped beating, yet she was eventually saved despite the fact that her temperature had dropped to 13.7degC. In extremely hot climates or as a result of uncontrollable infections, core body temperatures can rise to equally dangerous levels. This is hyperthermia. Life threatening hyperthermia typically starts in humans when their temperatures rise to 40.6-41.7degC. Only a few days at this extraordinarily high temperature level is likely to result in the worsening of internal organs and death. Question: People are unlikely to survive under the body temperature  _  . Answer: Answer:","output":"People are unlikely to survive under the body temperature of 29.4°C. Below this temperature, the body cools more rapidly, and its natural temperature regulating system usually fails, leading to a rapid decline in core body temperature and a higher likelihood of death."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Step 1: Identify the information in the first statement. - There is a bull rider. - The bull rider is hanging onto a rope. - The rope is around a large, bucking bull's back. Step 2: Compare the information in the first statement with the information in the second statement. - The second statement mentions a bull rider (matches the first statement). - The second statement refers to the rider wearing a brown cowboy hat (not mentioned in the first statement). - The second statement describes the bull as \\"a large black bull\\" (the first statement only mentions a large, bucking bull without specifying its color). Step 3: Determine if the second statement can be concluded from the information in the first statement. - There is no information about the bull rider wearing a brown cowboy hat in the first statement. - There is no information about the color of the bull in the first statement. Based on the analysis above, we cannot conclude that \\"A bull rider wearing a brown cowboy hat is riding a large black bull\\" from \\"A bull rider hangs on tightly to a rope around a large, bucking bull's back,\\" since the information about the cowboy hat and the color of the bull is not provided in the first statement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What is picked up by the water?\\" is \\"Underground\\"?","output":"No, sweetie, according to the paragraph, what's picked up by the water is \\"sediment\\".

Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous.  On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car.  While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude. If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else.  This kindness spreads.

Jane was finally able to earn extra money.","output":"Once upon a time, in the sleepy town of Willowbrook, there lived a hardworking young woman named Jane. She was well-known in the community for her cheerful disposition and willingness to help others in need. Despite her many burdens, she never let a frown settle on her face for long, meeting her daily struggles with a smile. Unfortunately, life in Willowbrook had become increasingly difficult. The local factory had been closed due to the economic recession, and many people lost their jobs. Jane, a single mother of two, was among the many who had to face the harsh reality of unemployment. With no savings, she had to find a way to support her family, and every day she grew more desperate. She tried various means to make ends meet, including starting a small vegetable garden in her backyard. However, a terrible flood one year ruined her harvest, and it seemed as if Jane would have to find another way to survive. Determined to make a better life for her children, she attended evening classes, developing her skills as a baker and chef, in the hope that she could use these skills to find a reliable career. It was during one of Jane's ventures into town that she came across an advertisement for a local baking competition. The prize was an apprenticeship with the renowned Chef Maurice, who ran a well-known bakery in the neighboring city. Jane knew that if she could win the competition, it would be the perfect opportunity to earn extra money to support her family while also learning from a talented chef. With the competition fast-approaching, Jane dedicated every spare moment to practicing her baking. She stayed up late into the night, perfecting the flavors and texture of her dishes. Her children, although exhausted from helping their mother, were incredibly proud of her determination and kept her company during the lengthy preparation sessions. Finally, the day of the competition arrived. Ten contestants, including Jane, lined up to present their baked creations to the judges. Jane's dish was a beautifully crafted three-tiered cake, adorned with intricately carved buttercream flowers and cascading vines. The inside of the cake was filled with succulent layers of raspberries, blueberries, and cream. Each bite was an explosion of heavenly flavors that could only be created by a master baker. The judges were astounded by Jane's abilities, and they unanimously decided to award her the first prize. Upon hearing her name, Jane could hardly believe her ears. As she accepted the apprenticeship from Chef Maurice, her eyes welled up with tears of joy, and her children rushed to her side, overjoyed that their mother's hard work had finally paid off. Jane began her apprenticeship immediately and quickly became an invaluable member of Chef Maurice's team. She worked tirelessly, learning new skills and perfecting her craft. Jane was finally able to earn extra money, providing her family with a better life while pursuing her passion for baking.

Eventually he cheated on her with one of her best friends and she kicked him out. I didn’t even notice he was gone for a week because he was so absent in my life. He apologized, turned into the man she first met and they tried again. He again cheated on her and she left him again, that time for good. They ended up finalizing the divorce a year later.

But lawmakers contend that in the wake of a rapidly-spreading Ebola crisis and the upcoming midterm elections, the President's commitment towards fighting the extremist terrorist organization has fallen short.  Comparing the spread of Ebola to the ISIS threat against the United States, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Sunday that he doesn't believe that the President is handling each issue with equal rigor.  \\"The stronger Ebola gets in Africa, the more it spreads and the more entrenched it is -- the more endangered we are,\\" Graham told Candy Crowley on CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" Sunday. \\"The same (goes) for radical Islam in the Mideast.

Article: If you need glasses to read this, you are among most of Chinese students. About four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight . And now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. Two main reasons can cause poor eyesight: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. They have less time to enjoy the sun. The sun, it turns out, is important in developing good eyesight. According to a study by Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about forty percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do. And poor eyesight at a young age can have serious long term influence. As you get older, your eyesight can worsen. With all that in mind, don't you think it's time to give your eyes a break?

A. victory  B. being ahead  C. winning prize  D. new option  E. fall  The best answer is The answer is:","output":"B. being ahead A reaching advantage, often referred to in the context of competitive racing such as athletics, sailing, and even combat sports, suggests that a competitor has a greater ability to stretch or extend their bodies further than their opponents. This could be due to factors such as longer limbs, superior technique, or better body positioning. In a race, a reaching advantage plays a significant role in determining one's performance and can be the difference maker in tight competitions. Though all the choices mentioned have a connection to the outcome of a race, \\"being ahead\\" (option B) is the most accurate answer related to a reaching advantage. Let's analyze each option to understand why being ahead is the best answer: A. victory While a reaching advantage can contribute to a competitor's overall success in a race, it does not guarantee victory. Factors such as stamina, strategy, and race conditions also play a significant role in determining the winner. B. being ahead A reaching advantage directly translates to a competitor being ahead in the race as they can cover more distance with each stride or reach, therefore creating a noticeable distance between them and their opponents. This answer is the most aligned with the concept of a reaching advantage. C. winning prize A reaching advantage may increase a competitor's chances of winning a prize, but just like option A, it does not ensure it. The outcome of a race involves many other factors. D. new option This answer does not directly relate to a reaching advantage in a race since it refers to an alternative choice rather than the outcome of the advantage. E. fall A reaching advantage is unlikely to cause a fall in a race, as it generally provides a better position and covering more distance. In fact, it would be counterintuitive for a reaching advantage to lead to a disadvantage like falling. In conclusion, a reaching advantage leading to \\"being ahead\\" in a race (option B) is the most accurate answer. It directly demonstrates the advantage a competitor could have in terms of distance and positioning, which could eventually contribute to their eventual success. However, it's essential to consider that other factors play a crucial role in determining the ultimate outcome of a race and that a reaching advantage alone might not guarantee a victory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lucy Stone (August 13, 1818 - October 18, 1893) was a prominent U.S. orator, abolitionist, and suffragist, and a vocal advocate and organizer promoting rights for women. In 1847, Stone became the first woman from Massachusetts to earn a college degree. She spoke out for women's rights and against slavery at a time when women were discouraged and prevented from public speaking. Stone was known for using her birth name after marriage, the custom at the time being for women to take their husband's surname. Lucy Stone was born on August 13, 1818, on her family's farm at Coy's Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. She was the eighth of nine children born to Hannah Matthews and Francis Stone; she grew up with three brothers and three sisters, two siblings having died before her own birth. Another member of the Stone household was Sarah Barr, \\"Aunt Sally\\" to the children- a sister of Francis Stone who had been abandoned by her husband and left dependent upon her brother. Although farm life was hard work for all and Francis Stone tightly managed the family resources, Lucy remembered her childhood as one of \\"opulence,\\" the farm producing all the food the family wanted and enough extra to trade for the few store-bought goods they needed.  Although Stone recalled that \\"There was only one will in our family, and that was my father's,\\" she described the family government characteristic of her day. Hannah Stone earned a modest income through selling eggs and cheese but was denied any control over that money, sometimes denied money to purchase things Francis considered trivial. Believing she had a right to her own earnings, Hannah sometimes stole coins from his purse or secretly sold a cheese. As a child, Lucy resented instances of what she saw as her father's unfair management of the family's money. But she later came to realize that custom was to blame, and the injustice only demonstrated \\"the necessity of making custom right, if it must rule.\\"  From the examples of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were at the mercy of their husbands' good will. When she came across the biblical passage, \\"and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee,\\" she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women's subjugation, but then reasoned that the injunction applied only to wives. Resolving to \\"call no man my master,\\" she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.  Kerr writes \\"Stone's personality was striking: her unquestioning willingness to take responsibility for other peoples actions; her \\"workaholic\\" habits; her self doubt; her desire for control.\\"","output":"This text is about Lucy Stone, a prominent U.S. orator, abolitionist, suffragist, and advocate for women's rights. Born on August 13, 1818, in West Brookfield, Massachusetts, she became the first woman from Massachusetts to earn a college degree in 1847. Stone was well-known for her public speaking against slavery and in support of women's rights during a time when women were generally discouraged from engaging in public discourse. She broke from convention by choosing to retain her birth name after marriage, instead of adopting her husband's surname as was customary at the time. Growing up in a family of nine children, Lucy Stone experienced firsthand the gender inequality prevalent in her society. Her father, Francis Stone, held complete authority over the family's finances, while her mother, Hannah Stone, could earn money but had no control over it. Lucy Stone's early life experiences led her to question societal customs and their effects on women. Distressed by a biblical passage that seemed to support the subjugation of women, Stone resolved to maintain autonomy over her own life by never marrying, pursuing higher education, and earning her own living. A key aspect of Lucy Stone's personality, as noted in the text, was her strong sense of responsibility for her actions and the actions of others. She displayed a tireless work ethic and was constantly driven by self-doubt and the desire to maintain control over her life. Her dedication and principles had a significant impact on the suffragist and abolitionist movements, making her an important figure in the advancement of women's rights in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Even when one of the slaves dropped dead on the line the rest were forced to keep what? Possible A: being, working, alive, jumping, breathing  Why is \\"working\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Working\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it fits contextually into the circumstances described in the question. The question sets a scene of slavery, wherein the slaves are likely being forced to perform strenuous labor in severe conditions. The phrase \\"dropped dead on the line\\" implies this labor was harsh enough to cause death, which further supports the idea that the slaves are engaged in strenuous physical work.  Consequently, the word \\"working\\" makes logical sense, as the most likely activity that the slaves would be unable to stop despite one of their number dying would be their labor. It fits into the historical understanding of what was expected of slaves during such a time period. Slaves were often treated poorly and were expected to continually work, even under the most brutal and inhumane conditions. It's not unreasonable to conclude that they would be made to continue working even after witnessing the death of a fellow slave. In comparison to other possible answers, \\"being\\" is too vague, \\"alive\\" doesn't fit because the slaves can't control if they stay alive or not, \\"jumping\\" seems unlikely as it is not a typical activity slaves would be doing, and \\"breathing\\" can't be forced by another. Furthermore, the forced continuation of work following such a traumatic event emphasizes the mercilessness and cruelty of the slave masters, which is a tragic feature emphasized in many historical accounts of slavery.  Thus, \\"working\\" aligns with common sense understanding not only due to the context provided within the sentence, but also considering the broader historical knowledge about the living and working conditions of slaves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For a California chain, the experience is nothing like \\"non smoking California\\". That being said, this is my second visit to this location and millionth time at a Wahoos. I did go into the bar to get a beer and take it back to my table, but when I got it back into the \\"smoke free room\\", I noticed after my first taste that the mug was completely cracked at the top. I asked for a bar manager so i didn't have to go back into the smoke and he brought me another beer with an explanation of how the temperature variation from the dishwasher to the freezer can crack a mug. Thanks Mr. Science. (Next beer is on us maybe? PLEEEZE not even an attempt at an offer).

Context: Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

He beat his estimate by a month. Today eight people received keys to their new cars in a delivery ceremony headlined by California Governor Jerry Brown. “I love it when people spend their money and make great stuff,” Brown roared to a boisterous crowd that had gathered at the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., to watch the exchange. Musk said the car is about “breaking a spell.” “The world has been under this illusion that electric cars cannot be as good as gasoline cars, that if you have to go with an electric car you’re accepting the car is worse,” he told the group. “What the Model S is about is breaking that illusion. It’s about showing that an electric car can be the best car in the world.” Musk says cars should work as seamlessly—and require about as much maintenance—as an iPad. Plenty of people believe him. Tesla has sold out of all 5,000 Model S units planned for next year, with a waiting list 10,000 people deep (it costs 5,000 to reserve one). Most of the initial buyers are Californians, with an even split between men and women. Only 10 percent already own Tesla’s 109,000 Roadster. “We believe customers will discover that this is the best car in every dimension – performance, safety, handling, the technology, the interface, styling, aesthetics,” Musk said. “It’s something that is fundamentally better.” The Model S is impressive. It fits seven people and will go 0-60 miles per hour in 6.5 seconds at a cost of 49,900 after 7,500 in federal rebates (that’s with a 40 kWh battery and160-mile range). An 84,900 85 kWh Performance variant gives a 300-mile-range; a 97,900 Signature Performance version adds such niceties as Nappa leather interior, exterior carbon fiber and special wheels. Top speed on that puppy is 130 miles per hour, with a 4.4-second 60mph sprint time. Each variant comes with an eight-year, unlimited miles guarantee. On the outside, the Model S is undeniably svelte, with sleek lines that evoke such stunners as the Aston Martin Rapide and the Porsche Panamera (yes, the Panamera’s looks are polarizing, but there is a resemblance, and some people love it). It was designed by Franz von Holzhausen, who had worked at Mazda and early in his career helped redesign Volkswagen’s Beetle. “We set out to change the world,” von Holzhausen said. Goodies like the all-glass panoramic sunroof (1,500), 17-inch touch-screen console and customizable charging options will certainly help sweeten the deal. Indeed, the car has been designed to appeal to buyers of high-end sedans like the BMW 5-Series and the Panamera. Musk describes them as people who want something that handles better and drives faster than the standard premium sedan. And he doesn’t hesitate to add that Model S is gunning for would-be buyers of the 200,000 Aston Martin Rapide and 128,000 Maserati Quattroporte as well. “From a performance standpoint we did consciously intend to beat them,” Musk says. “This is intended to be the best performance sedan out there.” Well, that 4.4 sprint time will beat a 5-Series on the track. The sub-100,000 MSRP will beat the Aston on price. The 300-mile drive range beats Chevy Volt’s 40-mile max. If production ramps up as much as Musk has promised—20,000 produced annually–this could be the start of something big. Stay tuned.

Swami Vivekananda (Bengali: [Sami bibekanondo] ( listen); 12 January 1863 - 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [norendronath doto]), was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna.  He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. Vivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita \\"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism\\". Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation:  Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy--by one, or more, or all of these--and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.  Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted \\"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\\".  Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddha (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, \\"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced\\".

Choose a color you love that complements items you know you're going to keep and display, such as a dresser or favorite piece of artwork. Start by moving everything away from the walls and masking the baseboards and ceiling. Apply a coat or 2 of primer and let it dry fully. Then, paint the walls with a roller using long, even strokes.   To make your room look more airy and open, choose a light color such as white, gray, or yellow. For a more dramatic effect, you can paint one wall a bold color and the rest a subtle hue. There are tons of cool paints to try, like chalkboard paint or magnetic paint. If you have the time and don’t mind putting in the effort, hanging wallpaper adds texture and drama to your walls. Pick a color or pattern you truly love since wallpaper is more difficult to remove or redo than simply painting the walls. Measure your room before purchasing wallpaper and be sure to get a little extra in case of any issues.   If your wallpaper is patterned, take care to line up the pattern when you add a new strip! You can use removable wallpaper if you don't want to commit to the print or color permanently. If you want something a little less common, you could cover your walls in shiplap, which is a type of siding composed on horizontal boards. You can use interlocking shiplap boards or even simple 1 by 6 in (2.5 by 15.2 cm) boards cut to the length of your walls. Work your way from the bottom of the wall to the top.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What two brands of amplifiers do grunge guitarists use?  Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". Answer:","output":"Grunge guitarists use Marshall guitar amplifiers and Mesa-Boogie amplifiers."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the physics. Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Problem: a group of men decided to do a work in 17 days , but 8 of them became absent . if the rest of the group did the work in 21 days , find the original number of men ?  Options: a ) 15 , b ) 20 , c ) 42 , d ) 25 , e ) 18","output":"To solve this problem, we use the concept of work. When a group of people work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates. First, let the number of men in the original group be 'x'. Let's assume one man does a unit of work per day. In the original plan, the group of x men would complete the work in 17 days. So the work can be expressed as the following: Work = Men × Time Work = x * 17 Now, 8 men become absent, so the remaining men = x - 8 These (x - 8) men took 21 days to complete the work, so the work can also be represented as: Work = Men × Time Work = (x - 8) * 21 Since both equations represent the same work, we can set them equal to each other: x * 17 = (x - 8) * 21 Now let's solve for x: 17x = 21(x - 8) 17x = 21x - 168 -4x = -168 x = 42 So, the original number of men is 42 (option 'c').  To come up with the answer, I used the concept of work and the given information to form two equations representing the same work done by the original group and the reduced (absent!) group. Then, by solving for the variable 'x', we find the original number of men."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A 25-year-old Hawaii surfer has survived a dramatic attack by a 12-foot tiger shark by jumping on top of it and punching it in the eye. Jeff Horton, a former boxer, said he was surfing off Pila'a Beach near Kilaueai in Kauai on Sunday with friends when he spotted a dark shape moving toward him and his board through the water. He explained that he was looking for a wave and seated with his feet dangling from the board. 'I look down and see what I thought was a sting ray,' Horton told Fox News. 'It came up on me and I jerked my foot and kicked it a couple of times. It went for the bite and missed my leg.' Scroll down for video. Lucky escape: Jeff Horton, a surfer in Hawaii, has survived a shark attack after hitting it in its eye. Damage: The shark's teeth marks can be seen on Horton's board - which he said he'll be putting on his wall. Horton pulled his left leg from the water and got on the surfboard, but was knocked off when the shark clamped its teeth down on the board. 'I rolled to the top of the shark and punched it in the mouth and got one shot in the eye,' Horton said. 'I thought I was going to die unless I put up the best fight I ever had.' He estimated that he hit the shark, which he guessed was about 12 feet long, about eight times. But when he punched it once in the eye, it recoiled, giving him a chance to jump on his board and frantically paddle back to the shore with another surfer. 'At that point I was pretty much in a full panic and started swimming for my life,' he said. 'I saw the shadow of its belly following me underneath.' Attack: He was attacked by the tiger shark (file photo) as he looked for waves on Sunday afternoon. Even though the shark followed, it did not attack again. When they reached the shore, he was welcomed back by a group of people and a tourist gave him 50 and told him to buy a bottle, The Garden Island reported. Horton's only injuries were scratches from the shark's rough skin on his knuckles and legs. 'I'm lucky to be here today,' he said. The 7-foot board, however, was left with a semi-circle imprint of the shark's jaws. Horton, who surfed again Monday at another beach, said he plans to put it up on his wall. Horton moved to Kauai from Washington D.C. two years ago and said, while he's been traumatized by the experience, he will be returning to the water. Scene: The shark was seen just off Kilauea, pictured, which has had no other shark attacks this year. But he said he won't be using the board - which displays the circular teeth marks of the shark - again; instead he plans to hang it on his wall. 'I'll surf the rest of my life,' he told The Garden Island. Tiger sharks are considered dangerous due to their size and indiscriminate feeding behavior and willingness to eat nearly anything - including objects at the surface, Hawaii Sharks explains. Some bites sustained by people are thought to be the result of investigatory behavior as the sharks bite creatures or objects to determine whether they are suitable to be eaten. There have been no reported shark attacks around Kauai this year. Three were recorded last year.

While dancing at the Palais Royale in Akron, Ohio, Bubbles, a cynical blonde chorine, and Judy O'Brien, an aspiring young ballerina, meet Jimmy Harris, the scion of a wealthy family. Both women are attracted to Jimmy, a tormented young man who is still in love with his estranged wife Elinor. Back in New York, Bubbles finds work in a burlesque club, while Madame Basilova, the girls' teacher and manager, arranges an audition for Judy with ballet impresario Steve Adams. En route to the audition, Madame Basilova is run over by a car and killed, and Judy, intimidated by the other dancers, flees before she can meet Steve. As she leaves the building, Judy shares an elevator with Steve, who offers her a cab ride, but she is unaware of who he is and rejects his offer. Soon after, Bubbles, now called Tiger Lily the burlesque queen, offers Judy a job as her stooge in the Bailey Brothers burlesque show and, desperate, she accepts. One night, both Jimmy and Steve attend the performance, and Judy leaves with Jimmy and tears up the card that Steve left for her. The next night, while at a nightclub with Judy, Jimmy has a fistfight with his ex-wife's new husband, and the next day their pictures appear in the newspaper. Bubbles, furious with Judy for stealing Jimmy, appears at the girl's apartment, where she finds Jimmy drunk on the doorstep and sweeps him away to the marriage bureau. Meanwhile, Steve's secretary, Miss Olmstead, also sees Judy's picture in the paper and identifies her as the dancer who had come to audition. That night, Steve attends Judy's performance at which the audience is given a lecture by Judy about the evils of viewing women as objects. This is followed by a fight between her and Bubbles over Jimmy. Hauled into night court, Judy is sentenced to ten days in jail but is bailed out by Steve.

Question: Information:  - The Gediminids (, , ) were a dynasty of monarchs in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that reigned from the 14th to the 16th century. One branch of this dynasty, known as the Jagiellons, reigned also in the Kingdom of Poland, Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Bohemia. Several other branches ranked among the leading aristocratic dynasties of Russia and Poland into recent times.  - The Battle of the Vorskla River was a great battle in the medieval history of Eastern Europe. It was fought on August 12, 1399, between the Tatars, under Edigu and Temur Qutlugh, and the armies of Tokhtamysh and Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania. The battle ended in a decisive Tatar victory.  - Maria of Vitebsk (died before 1349) was the first wife of Algirdas, future Grand Duke of Lithuania (marriage took place around 1318). Very little is known about her life. The only child of a Russian prince Yaroslav, Maria was the only heir to the Principality of Vitebsk. After her father's death ca. 1345, Vitebsk fell permanently under control of Algirdas and other Gediminids. Maria gave birth to five sons, all of whom grew up while Algirdas was still only a regional duke in Slavic lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. All five sons were baptized in Orthodox rite and ruled Russian lands giving rise to prominent clans of Russian dukes (Trubetskoy family from Demetrius I Starshy, Czartoryski family from Constantine, Sanguszko family from Fiodor, Belsky and Olelkovich families from Valdimir). After Maria's death, Algirdas married another Russian princess, Uliana of Tver. After Algirdas' death, eldest sons of Maria and Uliana battled over succession rights.  - Tokhtamysh (tat. Tuqtam) or Tokhtamsh (died 1406) was the prominent khan of the Blue Horde, who briefly unified the White Horde and Blue Horde subdivisions of the Golden Horde into a single state. He was a descendant of Genghis Khan's grandson, Tuqa-Timur.  - Andrei of Polotsk ( Belarusian :   , Lithuanian : Andrius Algirdaitis Polish : Andrzej Olgierdowic , ca . 1325 -- 12 August 1399 , in the Battle of the Vorskla River ) was the eldest son of Algirdas , Grand Duke of Lithuania , and his first wife Maria of Vitebsk . He was Duke of Pskov ( through his deputy Yuri , 1342 -- 1348 ) and Polotsk ( 1342 -- 1387 ) . As the eldest son of the Grand Duke , Andrei claimed his right to the throne after his father 's death in 1377 . Algirdas left Jogaila , his eldest son with his second wife Uliana of Tver , as the rightful heir . Andrei 's rivalry with Jogaila , Grand Duke of Lithuania and later King of Poland , eventually led to his demise .

There are several reasons behind this assessment.  Firstly, the act of defiance for Ms. Sugarman of \\"the saccharine\\"—which means excessively sweet, sentimental, or, in a literal sense, sugary—suggests that she is taking a stand against something that may be superficial or insincere. This shows courage and determination, generating a sense of admiration for her character.  Secondly, the fact that Ms. Sugarman \\"followed through\\" on her defiance bears the implication that she has successfully taken a stand and acted on her beliefs. This phrase highlights the notion of consistency and commitment to one's ideals, even when faced with challenges, which is generally perceived positively. Lastly, the context of the sentence is also critical for understanding its sentiment. Depending on the situation or the characters involved, the defiance of the saccharine might be a symbolic representation of resisting conformity or artificiality. Given that most readers are bound to appreciate authenticity and individuality, the sentiment in this sentence is more likely to lean towards the positive side.

Dan's small globe will have this kind of gravity compared to his larger globe: more or less? Answer:","output":"Dan's small globe will have less gravity compared to his larger globe. Gravity is a result of mass and the more mass an object has, the more gravitational force it exerts. If all other variables (like distance) remain the same, a smaller globe like Dan's will be less massive and therefore have less gravitational force than a larger globe. It's important to note, however, that this gravitational force is extremely small on everyday objects like globes - gravity becomes a noticeable force on much larger scales, such as planets or stars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping \\"wasn't very obvious\\" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\" The answer is:","output":"Warren's criticisms of the interface were that it had a steep learning curve, was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse, and forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you like cars you will love this film! There are some superb actors in the film, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance.The others are not bad either.... There are only two slight flaws to this film. Firstly, the poor plot, however people don't watch this film for the plot. Secondly, the glorification of grand theft auto (car crime). However if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it then good look to them, hope you have a good time in jail!

Plot title: Rocky II Movie plot: On New Year's Day, 1976, Apollo Creed has successfully defended his heavyweight title in a split decision, he and Rocky are taken to the same hospital. Apollo challenges Rocky to a rematch, but Rocky declines and officially retires from boxing. His girlfriend Adrian supports his choice, and so do his doctors, who reveal he will require surgery for a detached retina, which could lead to permanent blindness. In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and wants a truthful response if Apollo gave his all in the fight, to which Creed agrees. After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his life's changes: Rocky's new fame attracts an agent who sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine, and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian. She happily accepts, and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after, Rocky and Adrian happily learn that Adrian is pregnant. Meanwhile, fueled by hate mail, Apollo becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to prove that Rocky's performance was simply a fluke. Determined to rectify his boxing career's only blemish, Apollo ignores all pleas by his friends and family to forget the fight and move on to other potential opponents, and instead demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of his hiatus and have a rematch with him. Rocky at first seems unaffected by Apollo's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial problems. After largely unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill, his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of returning to boxing. At first, Mickey declines, concerned about Rocky's health, but he soon accepts after Apollo publicly insults Rocky. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to boxing and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight. Rocky argues he knows nothing else, so this is the only way he can provide.

Many people are surprised when they find that the Internet was set up in the 1960s. At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer network didn't work well. If one computer in the network broke down, then the whole network stopped. So a new network system had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working on the time. At first the Internet was only used by the government, but in the early 1970s, universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it too. However, computers were still very expensive and the Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed software that made \\"surfing\\" in the Internet more convenient. Today it is easy to get on-line and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day.

In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

SEOUL — The Inter-Korean summit began Friday morning with a historic step as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un crossed the military demarcation line that has divided Korea for over 60 years. At the end, the leaders of the communist North and Democratic South embraced prior to announcing a joint declaration committing to denuclearization and peace. \\"Today, Chairman Kim Jong Un and I confirmed that the realization of the nuclear-free Korean peninsula through complete denuclearization is our common goal,\\" said President Moon Jae-in at a ceremony to announce what they are calling the Panmunjom declaration. The North Korean leader also endorsed the joint declaration as well as past inter-Korean agreements without elaborating or specifically acknowledging the agreed upon outcome to dismantle his country's threatening nuclear program. \\"We have decided to open this transitional phase of improvement in relations and development by thoroughly implementing the North-South Declarations and all the agreements that have already been adopted,\\" said Kim. Kim is now the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korea. He was greeted by Moon, who waited on the South Korean side of the borderline in the village of Panmunjom, the historic site, where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. The two leaders smiled as they shook hands across the border. Kim then stepped over the cement boundary marker. Kim said he was, \\"excited to meet at this historic place\\" and later wondered \\"why it took so long\\" to get there. \\"It really has a strong emotional impact on me,\\" said Kim about the warm welcome he received from the people of South Korea. President Moon welcomed Kim to the South and said he would like to one day visit North Korea. Laughing, the two together momentarily stepped over the border marker into the North's side of the demilitarized zone. The two leaders posed for pictures with an unsmiling Kim dressed in a communist Mao-style suit and a smiling Moon in western business attire. Question: When did Moon cross the border into North Korea? === The answer to the above question is Select from: + After Kim had stepped into South Korea.. + not enough information. + After posing for pictures with Kim.. + When he first greeted Kim.. Answer:","output":"The correct answer from the given options is \\"After Kim had stepped into South Korea.\\" According to the information provided in the text, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un first crossed the border into South Korea. He was greeted there by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. After a warm welcome and a statement from Kim expressing his excitement about the meeting, he along with President Moon momentarily stepped across the border back into North Korea's side of the demilitarized zone, indicating Moon crossed the border after Kim had initially stepped into South Korea.   This historic event was marked by moments of camaraderie and symbolism, as reflected in the leaders' crossing of the border and their friendly interaction. Kim Jong Un's crossing into South Korea is a significant moment, marking the first time a North Korean leader has done so. Following suit, President Moon too crossed the border into North Korea, marking a symbolic and significant gesture in the context of this event. In addition to the border crossing, the summit resulted in the Panmunjom declaration, signaling a potential shift in relations between the two Koreas. The leaders committed to working towards denuclearization and establishing peace on the Korean peninsula. This indicates a shared goal between the two nations, despite their historically contentious relationship. While Kim Jong Un's approval of the declaration and previous agreements did not go into specifics, his agreement to work towards improving relations could mark a key turning point in inter-Korean ties. This summit, marked by a series of historic firsts, may represent an important step towards a resolution of the longstanding conflicts between North and South Korea. The physical crossing of the border by the two leaders, especially by Kim Jong Un into South Korea, can be seen as a strong gesture towards reconciliation and cooperation. Their commitment to denuclearization and peace may set a new course for the future of the Korean peninsula."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

From its convoluted plot to the uninspired dialogue and subpar character development, this movie serves as a prime example of how not to engage an audience. To start with, the plot is a mind-boggling mess. It tries to incorporate too many elements in a hurried attempt to create something unique and remarkable, but what results is an incomprehensible web of disconnected events and awkward twists. While a complex plot can sometimes enhance a cinematic experience, 'Disappointment on the Big Screen' falls short, leaving the viewer trying to piece together the remnants of a story that never quite gels together. The dialogue, as well, is nothing short of a tragedy. Characters speak in clichés and bland exposition, preventing the audience from connecting with them on any meaningful level. You cannot help but wonder if the screenwriter has ever actually spoken with another human being, given how unnatural and stilted the conversations appear on screen. It is painful to watch talented actors struggle through these lines, often resulting in a grimace rather than emotional investment. Sadly, poor character development lies at the crux of this movie's failings. The main characters are woefully one-dimensional, lacking the depth that drives the audience to genuinely care about their fates. This lack of character growth and exploration results in a superficial portrayal of human relationships, leaving the viewer feeling disconnected and emotionally uninvolved. Moreover, visually, 'Disappointment on the Big Screen' trades cinematic flair for tired techniques and lackluster special effects. Rather than captivating the audience with awe-inspiring moments, this film settles for mediocrity, often relying on gimmicks to make up for an absence of true substance. In terms of pacing, the movie drags on far too long. Uninterrupted by any semblance of an engaging subplot or character development, the runtime feels laborious and tedious. By the time the end credits finally roll, audiences may leave theaters feeling exhausted, wondering why they spent their valuable time and money on such a lackluster experience. To conclude, 'Disappointment on the Big Screen' is a cinematic letdown that fails in almost every aspect. Hindered by a convoluted plot, stilted dialogue, and poor character development, this film stands as a testament to wasted potential and squandered talent. When faced with the choice between attending the premiere of this film and doing anything else, audiences would find more value in the latter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Explanation: Thermal conduction, by its definition, is the transfer of heat (or hotness) from one part of a substance to another. So, it's accurate to say that in thermal conduction, materials conduct 'hotness' through themselves. Here's why the other options are not correct: (I) air - While air can be a medium for conduction, it's not the correct answer here. 'Air' is not what is being conducted across the material in thermal conduction. Instead, the heat is transferred across the material, whether that be air or something else. (III) electricity - This refers to electric conductivity, not thermal conductivity. While some materials, like metals, can conduct both heat and electricity, these are distinct concepts. In thermal conduction, we are specifically talking about the transfer of heat, not electricity. (IV) cold - 'Cold' is not a substance or energy that can be transferred. Coldness is simply the lack or absence of heat. Thus, you can't really conduct coldness; you can only remove or dissipate heat, which may result in an object becoming colder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Today, we are going to talk about a very important topic. Sometimes, bad things happen in the world. Do you know what helping means? It means supporting someone and making them feel better.

A couple who were not very nice, held them captive, that means they kept them locked up against their will like in a cage, for a very, very long time - more than 30 years! Can you imagine? That is even longer than your mommy and daddy are old!  Now that the women are free, many people wonder how they can get better and feel normal again. We asked some special people called \\"experts\\" and people who help others like charities about what can be done to make these women feel better. Here's what they said: First, when someone has been locked up for such a long time, time becomes very important. It's a little bit like when you're sick and mommy says you need to go to the doctor right away. The sooner they get help, the better they can start to recover. Another thing is that, when people have been through scary things together, they can help each other feel better. The three women in our story were all held captive together, so now that they are free, they can help each other feel strong. It is like when you're scared, and you hold onto your friend's hand, it makes you braver, right? So always remember kids, when we see people who have had bad things happen to them, the best we can do is to help them feel better and let them know they are not alone.

In 2008, renewable energy accounted for 8% of Greece's total energy consumption, rising from 7.2% in 2006. This increase was primarily driven by various renewable energy sources such as solar power, which contributed to 10% of the country's renewable energy production. The majority of Greece's renewable energy, however, came from biomass and waste recycling, emphasizing the importance of diversifying renewable energy sources. The European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy mandates that Greece must aim to derive 18% of its total energy consumption from renewable resources by 2020. The country's progress in 2013 demonstrates the feasibility of achieving this goal, with increasing investment in renewable energy technologies and infrastructure necessary to maintain and improve this proportion. Greece currently does not operate any nuclear power plants, which is significant, considering that nuclear energy is capable of contributing a sizable portion to the national energy consumption without producing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. However, the nuclear power's potential negative environmental and safety impacts led the Academy of Athens to suggest in 2009 that Greece should initiate research into the possible incorporation of nuclear power plants within the country's energy framework. In conclusion, Greece's highest proportion of energy generation from renewable sources reached over 20% of its electricity production in 2013. Although this proportion remains below the EU average, Greece is making strides in incorporating various renewable energy sources such as solar power, biomass, and waste recycling to meet the European Commission's goal of 18% by 2020. While no nuclear power plants currently operate in Greece, further research into the potential benefits and drawbacks of such plants could help shape the country's future energy policy, integrating cleaner alternatives and further reducing its reliance on fossil fuels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: The drones will spray a silicone-based liquid on rice paddies, where there are large expanses of stagnant water where malaria-carrying mosquitoes lay their eggs. The substance will spread across the water and prevent the eggs from hatching. It is hoped this will significantly reduce the numbers of the malaria-carrying anopheles mosquitoes in the area. The spraying by drones is a test to see if it will help the government of Zanzibar reach its goal of eliminating malaria on the archipelago by 2023, according to the strategic plan adopted by Zanzibar Malaria Elimination Program. The drone spraying is a relatively inexpensive way to stop the mosquitoes from reproducing, said Bart Knols, a medical entomologist and lead researcher of the program. “We are getting to the bottom of it as we will spray the breeding grounds of mosquitoes,” said Knols, who is with the Dutch Malaria Foundation. The drone will spray Aquatain, a liquid gel that will spread over a section of water and kill mosquitoes’ larvae, said Knols. The substance has been tested internationally and has been found to be harmless to non-target organisms, non-toxic and biodegradable. In the initial test, in the Cheju area of southern Zanzibar, the drone flew over and sprayed the shallow, sunlit water bodies in the rice paddies teeming with mosquito larvae, which were trapped as the gel spread across the water. Without the gel, the larvae would have emerged as adult mosquitoes in search of a blood meal. When those mosquitoes bite humans infected with malaria, they become vectors for the disease and continue its deadly transmission cycle. Along the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa, Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania have had a long, well-documented battle with malaria. In the last 10 years, Zanzibar, with a population of 1.2 million people, has embarked on different methods of fighting malaria. Thousands of mosquito nets have been distributed to put over beds and insecticide was supplied to spray in homes. The campaigns have succeeded in decreasing the disease’s prevalence. Some areas of Zanzibar have seen the prevalence of malaria drop from 40% of the population to less than 10%, according to the malaria elimination program. The spraying by drones is a new part of the strategy. The use of drones will be essential to efficiently spraying the large rice fields, which have been identified as malaria hot spots on Zanzibar. The drone is efficient because spraying by hand is very time consuming and using a helicopter is too expensive, said Eduardo Rodriguez of DJI, a Chinese drone manufacturer. With the help of drone pilots from the State University of Zanzibar, the DJI Agras drone is being tested to spray the rice paddies. “The ultimate vision of our fight against malaria is to bring malaria down to zero in year 2023 as our target,“said Abdullah Suleiman Ali, manager of the Zanzibar Malaria Elimination Program. ___ Follow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa Output:","output":"The drone spraying of a silicone-based liquid on rice paddies in Zanzibar aims to significantly reduce the numbers of malaria-carrying anopheles mosquitoes and help the government reach its goal of eliminating malaria on the archipelago by 2023."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jennifer had many more friends than Megan had because","output":"Jennifer had many more friends than Megan had because she took the time and effort to invest in building long-lasting, meaningful relationships with a diverse range of people. Jennifer was known for her natural ability to connect with others and make them feel at ease. From an early age, Jennifer made a conscious effort to develop excellent communication skills and a genuine interest in understanding the perspectives and experiences of those around her. She was always open to meeting new people and engaging in stimulating conversations that would expand her knowledge and worldview. Additionally, her empathetic nature allowed her to deeply connect with others, providing a strong foundation for the friendships she formed. Moreover, Jennifer made it a point to maintain a positive attitude and exude a sense of warmth and approachability, which drew people to her. She was known for her infectious laughter and ability to bring a sense of joy and optimism to any situation, making her friends feel uplifted in her presence. One of the key factors contributing to Jennifer's extensive social circle was her active participation in various clubs, teams, and social events. She believed that the more she exposed herself to new experiences and environments, the more opportunities she had to forge lasting connections. Jennifer also made sure to keep in touch with her friends via social media, phone calls, and regular get-togethers, making the effort to stay updated with their lives and offer a helping hand whenever needed. In contrast, Megan struggled to form deep connections with others, partly due to her more introverted personality and hesitancy to step out of her comfort zone. While she had a few close friends that she valued, Megan's inclination towards solitude and her difficulty in opening up to new people limited her ability to expand her social circle. She had a tendency to be guarded and selective when it came to forming friendships, which, coupled with her less active social life, led to her having fewer friends compared to Jennifer. Furthermore, Megan's reluctance to engage in vulnerability with others made it difficult for her friends to feel a close connection with her. As a result, the friendships she formed often remained superficial, lacking the depth and longevity that Jennifer's friendships enjoyed. Unlike Jennifer's proactive approach, Megan's passive demeanor made it challenging for her to cherish and nurture the relationships she had. In conclusion, Jennifer had many more friends than Megan because she not only dedicated herself to fostering strong, caring relationships but also embraced opportunities to connect with a wide variety of individuals. Through her exceptional people skills, positive attitude, and active involvement in numerous social experiences, Jennifer was able to build a rich and diverse network of friends that she cherished and maintained throughout her life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl, whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a Book of Mormon.  Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious street preacher lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the man—later identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)—to rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days.  In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly—a struggling actress—acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result.

The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\".

In the 1970s,oil shortages pushed the development of alternative energy sources,paving the way for the re-entry of the windmill to produce electricity.In the early 1980s,wind energy really took off in California,partly because of State policies that encouraged renewable energy sources.In the 1990s,the push came from a renewed concern for the environment in response to scientific studies indicating potential changes to the global climate if the use of...

The answer indicates that the classification system used for NARA's holdings is based on record groups, which in turn correspond to the governmental departments or agencies that created or maintained these records. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for preserving and documenting government and historical records. NARA's primary function is to safeguard and make available for research the valuable and historically significant records created by federal departments and agencies. To facilitate the organization and access to these records, NARA has established a classification system known as \\"record groups.\\" These groups are formed based on the governmental department or agency from which the records originated. Each record group contains a unique collection of documents, files, and materials that relate to the functions and activities of the particular department or agency they represent. Record groups help researchers, historians, and the general public to locate and access materials that are relevant to a specific governmental organization or subject matter. By grouping records according to their originating department or agency, NARA ensures that the contextual history and background of the records are preserved, making it easier to understand their significance and the role they played in the overall functioning of the United States government. In summary, NARA's holdings are classified into record groups, which are representative of the governmental department or agency that generated or maintained the records.

Russia responded by beginning to drive out Tajik guest workers, a move that threatens Tajikistan's entire economy. In total, some 700,000 Tajik citizens work in Russia. In the past quarter, they sent home some 742 million in remittances  . Overall, the money guest workers send back makes up half of the republic's government budget.  The Alauddin Valley is in the Fann Mountains in eastern Tajikistan. The place long held an attraction for Russian writers and adventurers. Later, during the Soviet era, it was a popular tourist destination. Yet establishing a strong relationship with the people of the mountainous region is not easy. Men are seldom seen in the area. Nearly every family has at least one breadwinner working in Russia, if not more. The farm work falls to the women, who divide it up among themselves. Each summer, the village chooses the most experienced and skilled women to take all of the cows (up to 300 of them) to the summer pastures   high up on in the mountains. The women spend four months there with their children since there is no one to leave the children with. They milk the cows and prepare products for the winter: cheese, butter and so on. These fermented   goods get them through the winter when snow and avalanches   cut off all contact with civilization.  Residents here generally have two questions for visiting Russians. The first one is obvious: Is President Dmitri Medvedev going to limit the entry of Tajik guest workers? The second question is less obvious: Are there cows in Moscow? The Alauddin Valley's women truly can't imagine life without either. Question: Why was the Russian pilot arrested? Options: A: Because he stole a plane in Tajikistan.

At the very end of the 19th century, a new style, with a carved top and back construction inspired by violin family instruments began to supplant the European-style bowl-back instruments in the United States. This new style is credited to mandolins designed and built by Orville Gibson, a Kalamazoo, Michigan luthier who founded the \\"Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Co., Limited\\" in 1902. Gibson mandolins evolved into two basic styles: the Florentine or F-style, which has a decorative scroll near the neck, two points on the lower body and usually a scroll carved into the headstock; and the A-style, which is pear shaped, has no points and usually has a simpler headstock. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What sytle did the new style of mandolins supplant?","output":"The new style of mandolins, which emerged at the end of the 19th century and was spearheaded by Orville Gibson, supplanted the European-style bowl-back instruments in the United States. These bowl-back designs were characteristic of their deep, bowl-shaped backs, a tradition that was heavily influenced by European luthiers. Orville Gibson paved the way for modern mandolin craftsmanship by introducing a new design influenced by the construction of violin family instruments. His innovative style featured a carved top and back, which significantly differed from the prevalent European-style bowl-back construction. Gibson's carve top and back construction brought forth a more robust sound and easier playability by addressing issues faced with the bowl-back style. The bowl-back was often uncomfortable to hold against the body and had a more delicate, complex construction which made it more suitable for classical and folk music, but less adaptable to the new music styles emerging in America around that time. Orville Gibson's innovative design lent itself to a new era of mandolin manufacturing. His company, the \\"Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Co., Limited,\\" later developed this new style into two main distinct types based on their shapes and decoration.  The first is the \\"Florentine\\" or \\"F-style,\\" characterized by a decorative scroll near the neck, two points on the body's lower part, and often a scroll carved into the headstock. The second is the \\"A-style,\\" distinguished by its pear-like shape, the absence of points, and typically featuring a simpler headstock design. This revolutionary transformation of mandolin design from the European-style bowl-back to the carved top and back reflected the changing musical tastes and the cultural shift happening in the United States at the turn of the 20th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Welche Erfahrungen bestehen bei der Umsetzung/Import von „Alt-Dokumentation“ (MS Word, Adobe Framemaker) in S1000DTM und der Unterstützung durch die Software? Translate to English","output":"What experiences exist in the implementation/import of \\"old documentation\\" (MS Word, Adobe FrameMaker) into S1000D and the support provided by the software? When implementing or importing old documentation like MS Word files or Adobe FrameMaker files into the S1000D standard, there are several experiences and challenges to consider. S1000D is an international specification for the production of technical publications that has been widely used in the defense and aerospace industries. Transitioning to S1000D from traditional documentation formats involves adapting and restructuring the data, making it essential to understand the complexities of the conversion process. Here, I will discuss the experiences in importing old documentation into S1000D and the support provided by different software tools. 1. Conversion and restructuring: Converting MS Word, Adobe FrameMaker, or other old documentation formats to S1000D requires a thorough analysis of the original documents. Companies need to identify content modules, segregate data into smaller chunks, and create task-oriented documentation. Reformatting might involve reorganizing content layouts, redesigning templates, and ensuring compliance with the S1000D schema. 2. Data modules and content reuse: In S1000D, technical information is divided into smaller units known as data modules. These data modules can be used and reused throughout the project in various contexts. During the conversion process, it is necessary to identify the data modules, assign unique identification codes, and define relationships between them to ensure proper tracking and reuse throughout the project lifecycle. 3. Consistency and compliance: Establishing consistency and compliance with S1000D standards is crucial while importing old documentation. It might involve creating and applying a common source database (CSDB), which serves as the central repository for all data modules, metadata, and relationships. Proper management of information in a CSDB ensures consistency and compliance across all documentation outputs. 4. Software support: Several tools and software programs are available to support the conversion and management of old documentation to S1000D. Some popular options include SDL Contenta, PTC Arbortext, and R4i Binder from Pennant PLC. These tools offer a comprehensive set of features for importing, converting, and managing S1000D content. They help in automating the conversion process, validating data, and ensuring compliance with S1000D standards. 5. Training and support: Transitioning to S1000D also demands upskilling and training the technical documentation team. Companies must offer appropriate training courses and workshops to familiarize employees with S1000D requirements, standards, and best practices. This training ensures a smooth transition to the new documentation format and reduces the risk of errors and inefficiencies in creating and managing technical publications. In summary, implementing or importing old documentation into S1000D demands thorough content analysis, data module identification, and an understanding of the standard's requirements. Companies must invest time and resources in training and equipping their teams to work with S1000D. Leveraging specialized software tools, ensuring consistency and compliance, and focusing on content reuse are essential for a successful transition and efficient management of technical publications in the S1000D environment."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Write an article based on this \\"President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has confounded many observers by holding on to power for more than four years in the face of a rebellion by a large part of the population.\\" Article:","output":"Title: President Bashar al-Assad's Unyielding Grip on Power: A Tale of Four Years and Beyond Introduction It's been over four years since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war that has plunged the country into chaos, death, and destruction. Capturing the world's attention is President Bashar al-Assad, who has managed to hold onto power in the face of a nationwide rebellion. The resilience and determination of this controversial leader have left many observers stunned and puzzled. How could al-Assad survive a comprehensive revolt for such a long period while many other rulers would have succumbed under similar circumstances? This article delves into this question, examining the factors and key players that contribute to the unyielding grip of Assad's regime on Syria. 1. A Fractured Opposition Despite the united objective of overthrowing the Assad government, the Syrian opposition itself is far from unified. Comprised of diverse groups with differing interests, ideologies, and strategic visions, the opposition often suffers from infighting and disunity, greatly hindering its ability to pose a significant challenge to the regime. This lack of cohesion has given Assad an unintended advantage, allowing him to exploit these divisions and maintain a semblance of control. 2. The Role of Syria's Allies: Iran and Russia The support of Iranian and Russian governments has been instrumental in ensuring the survival of the Assad regime. Iran's proxy forces, including the Lebanese Hezbollah, have provided critical military support, which has bolstered the regime's ability to counter the opposition. Russia, on the other hand, has supplied weapons, conducted airstrikes, and used its veto power as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to protect Assad's interests. The unwavering backing of these allies has significantly strengthened the regime's position and diminished the odds of its downfall. 3. The Sectarian Dynamics of the Conflict The conflict in Syria is not merely a struggle for power but is also fueled by deep-seated sectarian divisions. Alawites, a minority sect to which the Assad family belongs, dominate the regime leadership. As the violence in Syria escalated, the fight transformed into an existential battle between the Alawites and the majority Sunni population, which forms the backbone of the rebellion. This sectarian dimension of the conflict has rallied the Alawite community around the regime, fearing potential reprisals from the Sunni opposition in case of a regime collapse. This has garnered tremendous support for Assad from his core constituents, thus bolstering his grip on power. 4. The Role of Foreign Fighters and Radicalization The Syrian conflict has attracted foreign fighters from across the globe seeking to wage jihad under the banner of ISIS and other extremist groups. This influx of outsiders has complicated the Syrian landscape and made it more difficult to forge alliances and present a united front against the Assad regime. Moreover, the radicalization of the opposition has also made it significantly less appealing to potential international supporters, who view siding with extremist groups as a risky proposition. 5. Western Reluctance to Fully Engage in the Syrian Crisis While Western countries have long called for Assad's removal and sought to support the Syrian opposition through various means, they have consistently shied away from a more direct military intervention. The reluctance to engage in another Middle Eastern conflict has limited the resources available to the opposition, preventing it from mounting a serious challenge to Assad's rule. This lack of decisive Western involvement has inadvertently aided the regime's survival. Conclusion The astounding persistence of President Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria can be attributed to a multitude of factors such as a fractured opposition, support from Iran and Russia, sectarian underpinnings, and the cautious stance of wary Western countries against direct intervention. This complex interplay of internal and external factors has served to strengthen Assad's position and prolong his command in the face of a seemingly never-ending conflict. As the Syrian civil war rages on and the numerous initiatives for a peaceful resolution falter, the enigma surrounding the endurance of al-Assad's rule no doubt continues to bewilder analysts and observers alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that?

Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement.

BBC Television On 1 September 1939, two days before Britain declared war on Germany, the station was taken off air with little warning; the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft homing in on London. Also, many of the television service's technical staff and engineers would be needed for the war effort, in particular on the radar programme. The last programme transmitted was a Mickey Mouse cartoon, Mickey's Gala Premier (1933), which was followed by test transmissions; this account refuted the popular memory according to which broadcasting was suspended before the end of the cartoon.

The Village Voice, the iconic New York newspaper that became online-only last year, has shut down.      “Today is kind of a sucky day,” said owner Pete Barbey in a phone call, according to audio obtained by Gothamist.      “Due to, basically, business realities, we’re going to stop publishing Village Voice new material. About half the staff, it’ll be last day today. About half the staff staying on to wind things down and to work on the archive project,” Barbey reportedly said, referring to efforts to archive the Voice’s content.

Barbey bought the famous citycentric weekly, co-founded by Dan Wolf, Ed Fancher and Norman Mailer in 1955, from Voice Media Group in 2015 after it spent years going through assorted owners, mergers and separations. Barbey also noted on the call that he bought the publication to save it.      “This isn’t exactly how I though it was going to end up. I’m still trying to save The Village Voice,” he said, before telling his staff that they had “amazing grit” and remained “professional” through it all.      Bloomberg via Getty Images Distribution boxes like this one, pictured in 2017, used to dot New York City.      Cindy Ord via Getty Images      Just one year ago, the alt-weekly ceased print operations and moved solely to digital. That news rattled the newsroom, with film editor Alan Scherstuhl telling Esquire at the time, “I think everybody was stunned.”      “You know how you always expect this will be the last month things keep going? Everybody is kind of surprised, but also like, ‘I can’t believe we got away with it this long,’” he said.      A statement from Barbey confirmed that the paper was indeed shuttering and recalled its illustrious history that “defined a new genre of publishing” and how it was “subject to the increasingly harsh economic realities facing those creating journalism and written media.”      “The Village Voice was created to give speed to a cultural and social revolution, and its legacy and the voices that created that legacy are still relevant today. Perhaps more than ever,” the statement said.      Barbey continued:      Its archives are an indispensable chronicle of history and social progress. Although the Voice will not continue publishing, we are dedicated to ensuring that its legacy will endure to inspire more generations of readers and writers to give even more speed to those same goals.

It was a good run. — Neil deMause (@neildemause) August 31, 2018      The publication’s closure particularly struck a chord with journalists who got their start in that newsroom and those who contributed to the publication in its six-decade life:      I was happy to keep writing for the site, including my recent Aretha Franklin obit, but the owner has announced there will be no new content.

The Voice has been a key element of New York City journalism and is read around the world. As the first modern alternative newspaper, it literally defined a new genre of publishing.

The Voice has connected multiple generations to local and national news, music, art, theater, film, politics and activism, and showed us that it’s idealism could be a way of life. In recent years, the Voice has been subject to the increasingly harsh economic realities facing those creating journalism and written media.

The Village Voice was created to give speed to a cultural and social revolution, and its legacy and the voices that created that legacy are still relevant today. Perhaps more than ever. Its archives are an indispensable chronicle of history and social progress. Although the Voice will not continue publishing, we are dedicated to ensuring that its legacy will endure to inspire more generations of readers and writers to give even more speed to those same goals. We have begun working to ensure that the enormous print archive of The Village Voice is made digitally accessible. I began my involvement with the Voice intending to ensure its future. While this is not the outcome I’d hoped for and worked towards, a fully digitized Voice archive will offer coming generations a chance to experience for themselves what is clearly one of this city’s and this country’s social and cultural treasures. From the bottom of my heart, I thank everyone who pulled together to attempt create a new future for The Village Voice. Their passion and perseverance have inspired me. I will always be humbled by the grit they’ve shown and the dedication they have displayed.      (Disclosure: This reporter spent a year at the Voice from 2016 to 2017.)

The owner of the groundbreaking New York City publication, Peter Barbey, gave staff the news on Friday.      “Today is kind of a sucky day,\\" he said, according to audio obtained by Gothamist. “We’re going to stop publishing Voice's material online.”      The decision to close shop comes one year after the former alternative weekly newspaper went 100 percent digital as a last-ditch effort to stay afloat.

Approximately half of the staff, 15 to 20 people, will be staying on to archive some of the publication’s content.

I read this background article the other day: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures.  I am facing a new situation today: Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted.                                                                                            Thomas is a research assistant and has taken samples of rat liver enzymes that need to be stored overnight. He places one in refrigerated storage, but forgot one and left it out on the counter top.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sample will be viable for longer, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? The answer to this question is:","output":"The sample that will be viable for longer is the one placed in refrigerated storage.  This is because, according to the background article, many unstable materials like enzymes tend to be viable longer at lower temperatures. By placing the rat liver enzyme sample in refrigerated storage, Thomas is effectively reducing its temperature, which slows down any potential degradation or loss of activity of the enzymes. On the other hand, the sample left on the countertop at room temperature will be exposed to a relatively higher temperature, which could potentially speed up any degradation process and reduce the enzyme's viability more quickly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a treat, the rich husband presented his wife a new car instead of a purse since the","output":"woman had always desired one. She had always harbored a love for luxury cars, often spending her leisure time browsing through car magazines and attending various automobile events. Knowing this, her husband believed that the gift of a brand new car would completely delight her and further strengthen their bond. The wife was over the moon as she excitedly laid eyes on her birthday surprise. It was a sleek, state-of-the-art vehicle, shining majestically under the carefully positioned spotlights. The new car's exterior was a stunning shade of sapphire blue, reflecting her refined taste and the depths of their love. With a beautiful leather interior, a robust engine, and an exceptional sound system, the car had everything she could have ever wanted and more. It was the epitome of luxury and class—a vehicle that was truly a masterpiece. Together, the husband and wife admired the details and craftsmanship of this splendid automobile. Noticing her husband's beaming expression, the wife could feel the warmth and depth of his love. She hugged him tightly, her eyes tearing up with joy and gratitude for having him by her side. It was a moment that would forever be etched in her heart. From that moment on, the wife began attending driving lessons with the same unbridled fervor that she had once reserved for her favorite car magazines. It wasn't long before she earned her driver's license and began to freely roam the city streets, reveling in the car's smooth acceleration and the envious glances of bystanders. As the months rolled by, the couple decided to take a thrilling road trip to celebrate their upcoming wedding anniversary. They planned their route meticulously – a breathtaking journey through scenic back roads, charming villages, and endless stretches of picturesque landscapes. With the wind in their hair and the open road before them, they felt as if they were embarking on a grand adventure, wrapped within the cocoon of their new car. Throughout the trip, the couple made countless memories, sharing laughs, heartwarming stories, and intimate conversations to strengthen their bond. Over candlelit dinners and quiet sunsets, they reminisced about their life together and the love that had only grown stronger with each passing day. However, along the journey, they also encountered instances that reminded them of the fleeting nature of existence. They passed by a roadside memorial, reflecting on the fragile balance between life and death. This somber moment led them to appreciate the impermanence of material possessions and the true worth of their love and connection with each other, which stood as the underlying foundation of their happiness. As the road trip drew to a close, it became evident that the car, although a luxurious and generous gift, was not the ultimate manifestation of their love. Instead, it had acted as a catalyst, allowing them to not only explore the world together but also to further open their hearts and deepen their understanding of the tremendous love they shared. While the vehicle remained a testament to the wife's passion for luxury cars and a symbol of her husband's appreciation of her desires, it served as a constant reminder of the beautiful memories they had created together. The car had become more than just an object; it was a tangible representation of their bond and a reminder of the essential truth that love, shared experiences, and understanding were the cornerstones of their lasting happiness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Remember the Titans Movie plot: It's 1971 in Alexandria, Virginia and successful high school football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) has just been deprived of the head coaching job at the new integrated T.C. Williams High School to make way for equally successful black coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). Yoast debates pursuing opportunities elsewhere, but when most of his white players vow to sit out the season unless he coaches, he changes his mind and stays on as Boone's assistant.Throughout training camp and the season, Boone and Yoast's black and white players learn to accept each other, to work together, and that football knows no race. As they learn from each other, Boone and Yoast also learn from them and in turn, the whole town learns from the team, the Titans. Thus, they are prepared to pursue the State Championship and to deal with an unthinkable tragedy that threatens to sink their perfect season.Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Donald Faison, Ryan Gosling, Hayden Panettiere, and Kate Bosworth co-star.This makes for a good story, but not totally true. Northern Virginia Schools, which consist of Arlington and Fairfax County, the Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church Schools were already integrated when T.C.

Langley HS, McLean Va, (Home of the Langley Saxons) which opened in 1966 had the first Black / African American Football Coach Charles Price, who later went to Groveton HS after developing a successful football program at Langley.

Answer:","output":"The movie \\"Remember the Titans\\" takes place in the year 1971, set in Alexandria, Virginia. The film, based on a true story, follows the integration of the T.C. Williams High School football team. Coaches Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington) and Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton) work together to overcome racial tensions and prejudices within the team and the community. While it is true that Northern Virginia schools like Arlington and Fairfax County, as well as the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church, were already integrated when T.C. Williams High School was built and opened, the film focuses on the story of this particular school and the challenges faced by the coaches and players during the 1971 season. It is essential to note that the movie presents a dramatized account of the events, and some elements may not be entirely accurate. For instance, other schools in the area, such as Langley High School, McLean, George C. Marshall, Falls Church, and Herndon high schools, had already integrated their sports teams, including football, in the late 1960s. However, further away from Northern Virginia, in counties like Loudoun and Prince William and deeper into the Shenandoah Valley and southern Virginia areas, schools were still segregated, and the racial tensions were more intense. Warren County was one of the worst examples, being the last school system in Virginia to allow African Americans in schools, forcing them to walk to other jurisdictions as they were denied education well into the 20th century. Despite some historical inaccuracies, \\"Remember the Titans\\" tells an inspirational story of unity, teamwork, and overcoming racial barriers, both on and off the football field. The film demonstrates how the coaching partnership between Boone and Yoast and their dedication to fostering an environment of respect and acceptance led to a successful season that served as an example for others facing similar challenges. In deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, consider the impact and relevance of the story. While some historical aspects may not be entirely accurate, the message of the film and its themes of overcoming adversity, fostering unity, and breaking down racial barriers remain powerful and thought-provoking. These elements contribute to the film's potential to resonate with audiences and deliver a strong, memorable cinematic experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Theater Review - 'Vision Disturbance' - At Abrons Arts Center, Linda Mancini and Jay Smith - NYTimes.com Mondo, a Greek-born woman living in Reading, Pa., doesn’t like the theaters in this country. They’re ugly, she says, in a voice that walks a straight and uninflected line, as if the slightest animation might throw her off balance. Her words reduce American playhouses to an unforgiving, haiku-esque collection of phrases: “Four walls. I cannot take them. We’re prisoners here. The hell of the life.” Mondo knows whereof she speaks. Take a look at the play she appears in: Christina Masciotti’s “Vision Disturbance,” a work with a deadpan face and a fluttering heart, at the Abrons Arts Center. The set from which Mondo talks and talks about the flattening circumstances of her life is a single naked wall and matching floor of raw wood. A cut-rate coffin comes to mind, something cheap and provisional but also eternally confining. As portrayed by the performance artist Linda Mancini, Mondo speaks, even when excited or close to hysteria, in a faltering monotone that will probably sound familiar to regular downtown theatergoers. So will the similar delivery — lost, neutral and vaguely angry — of Dr. Hull (Jay Smith), the specialist whom Mondo consults about an eye problem that gives the play its title. Their voices suggest those of characters from a drama by Richard Maxwell, that uncompromising New York theater auteur whose productions are exciting precisely because they dare to be dull. This is not a coincidence. Mr. Maxwell is the director of “Vision Disturbance,” and his singular affectless style of presentation is much in evidence here. The steady application of that style — and the poetic uses Ms. Masciotti makes of Mondo’s fractured English — keeps you at first from realizing that beneath this aura of downtown cool lurks a rather conventional play. Ms. Masciotti might cringe at the comparison, but about 20 minutes into “Vision Disturbance” two words came unbidden into my head: “Educating Rita.” That’s the title of a 1980 play by Willy Russell (made into a 1983 movie) that I happened to see last month in a London revival. It’s a “Pygmalion”-like story of a working-class hairdresser bent on self-improvement and the English professor who initiates her transformation. It is also, like Mr. Russell’s “Shirley Valentine,” a feel-good, wish-fulfillment tale for women who feel trapped in lives run and constricted by their men. “Vision Disturbance” certainly doesn’t make as undisguised or aggressive a lunge at the heartstrings as Mr. Russell’s plays do. As Mondo says to Dr. Hull, responding to his earnest suggestion that listening to classical music might help her with her eye condition: “I don’t believe in fantasy-tale stories. I am reality period. Reality.” But of course reality is, uh, relative. Mondo’s ocular affliction, which may well have been brought on by the stress of divorce negotiations with her adulterous husband, causes her to see the world in disorienting and disconnecting ways. Here she is on looking at her own living room: “The whole room could have been some kind of wallpaper. It was all completely flat. Like when I walked into the room all the furniture jumped into the wall.” That evocative passage shows Ms. Masciotti’s particular talent for making lyrical use of the limited vocabulary of someone struggling with English. Sometimes, though, the script pushes its heroine’s winning verbal originality too hard. (She describes the crest of an ocean wave as being like a “white afro.”) We’re meant to be captivated by this inspired and inventive malapropist. Certainly Dr. Hull is, and it shouldn’t be a surprise when he becomes a bit too interested in body parts other than the eyes, while examining Mondo.","output":"\\"Vision Disturbance\\" is a play with a deadpan face and a fluttering heart, directed by Richard Maxwell and performed at the Abrons Arts Center in New York.

Bu cümle, Belçikalı savaş suçlusu Radovan Karadzic'in parasal desteğini kesmeyi amaçlayan bir stratejiyi tasvir ediyor. Burada belirtilen Ashdown, Paddy Ashdown'dan bahsediyor olabilir, Birleşik Krallık'tan bir politikacı ve Bosna-Hersek'teki Yüksek Temsilci.  Karadzic, Bosna Savaşı sırasında Sırp halkının haklarını savunan ve ayrılıkçı hareketlerin öncülüğünü yapan önemli bir figürdür. Ayrıca, 1990'lı yılların başında Sırp Demokrat Parti'yi (SDS) kurdu. Ancak, savaş suçları nedeniyle uluslararası arama emri aldı ve gizlenmek için sürekli hareket halinde olması gerekti.  Ashdown'ın stratejisi, Karadzic'in SDS'nin banka hesaplarına erişememesini sağlamaktı ve böylece onun hareket kabiliyetini sınırlamaktı.

You are given a new situation: Mike was reading about climate change. The author compared two different time periods, era A and era B. Era A was set in the present day. But era B was set in the year 2040. Mike was surprised to find how Arctic area would change in the coming years.  and a hint : Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice reduces the planet's average albedo, possibly resulting in global warming in a positive feedback mechanism. Research shows that the Arctic may become ice free in the summer for the first time in human history within by 2040. Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.Warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global ocean current patterns. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.As the extent of sea ice diminishes and sea level rises, the effect of storms such as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 on open water increases, as does possible salt-water damage to vegetation on shore at locations such as the Mackenzie's river delta as stronger storm surges become more likely.Global warming has increased encounters between polar bears and humans. Reduced sea ice due to melting is causing polar bears to search for new sources of food. Beginning in December 2018 and coming to an apex in February 2019, a mass invasion of polar bears into the archipelago of Novaya Zemlya caused local authorities to declare a state of emergency. Dozens of polar bears were seen entering homes and public buildings and inhabited areas.  Please answer this question : Would era B see less or more ice in the Arctic than era A? Answer:","output":"Era B, set in the year 2040, would see significantly less ice in the Arctic compared to era A (the present day). The reduction in Arctic sea ice is attributed to the warming of global temperatures, largely due to human activities such as excessive greenhouse gas emissions. This warming results in the melting of polar ice caps and a decrease in the average albedo of Earth, leading to a positive feedback mechanism where more sunlight is absorbed instead of being reflected back into space, further amplifying global warming. As Mike read, research indicates that the Arctic could even experience ice-free summers for the first time in human history within the timeframe of era B, by the year 2040. This dramatic change in Arctic conditions has various implications on ecosystems, wildlife, and global climate. For example, the melting of Arctic ice could disrupt global ocean current patterns by introducing large amounts of fresh meltwater into the north Atlantic, potentially leading to significant climate changes and instability. Furthermore, the reduction in sea ice and rising sea levels contribute to stronger open-water storm events and storm surges, such as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012, resulting in increased damage to coastal ecosystems and infrastructure. Another consequence of diminishing sea ice in era B would be the increase in encounters between polar bears and humans. As hunting grounds shrink and traditional food sources become scarce, polar bears are forced to search for alternative means of sustenance in more populated areas, leading to dangerous situations like the mass invasion of polar bears in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in 2018-2019. In conclusion, era B will witness a significant decrease in Arctic ice compared to era A, with myriad consequences for ecosystems, wildlife, and global climate stability. The challenges posed by these drastic changes in the Arctic landscape underscore the importance of immediate and meaningful action to combat climate change and curtail its far-reaching impacts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hong Kong Electronics called a cover for North Korea's missile proliferation network. U.S. Treasury says company's U.S. assets frozen, transactions in U.S. prohibited. It says company worked with bank, arms dealer tied to other sanctioned entities. Goal is to stop misuse of financial system to advance arms programs, Treasury says. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: U.S. Treasury Crackdown on Hong Kong Electronics: An Attempt to Curb North Korean Missile Proliferation Introduction: The U.S. Treasury announced that it has frozen Hong Kong Electronics' U.S. assets and prohibited transactions within the country, accusing the company of acting as a cover for North Korea's missile proliferation network. The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has identified the company's covert involvement with a bank and arms dealer, both of which have links to other sanctioned entities. This decisive move comes as the U.S. government aims to prevent the misuse of its financial system in supporting the advancement of North Korea's arms programs. Step 1: Explaining Hong Kong Electronics' role Hong Kong Electronics is believed to have facilitated financial transactions for North Korea's missile proliferation network, in collaboration with at least one bank and an arms dealer, both of which have ties to other sanctioned entities. This secretive activity not only circumvents international sanctions but poses a significant threat to global security and stability. Step 2: Disclosing the U.S. Treasury's actions In response to these allegations, the U.S. Treasury decided to freeze Hong Kong Electronics' U.S. assets and prohibit any future financial transactions within the United States. This action is in line with the Treasury's efforts to protect the country's financial system from being manipulated for illegal purposes, particularly in supporting North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. Step 3: Reiterating the U.S. Government's Goals  This move by the Treasury highlights the U.S. Government's commitment to halt any attempts at misusing the nation's financial system for advancing the arms and nuclear programs of countries, such as North Korea. The U.S. aims to exert further pressure on North Korea to halt its nuclear ambitions and abide by international sanctions imposed by the United Nations, which are designed to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons and preserve global peace. Step 4: Analyzing potential implications As a consequence of the U.S. Treasury's actions against Hong Kong Electronics, other entities linked to North Korean arms proliferation may feel increased pressure and scrutiny to avoid further sanctions. This could potentially disrupt the global networks linked with North Korea's missile programs, ultimately limiting their progress. Step 5: Forecasting future U.S. initiatives In light of this crackdown, it is likely that the U.S. government will continue to closely monitor and investigate companies suspected of assisting North Korea's missile proliferation network. As such, additional sanctions and asset freezes may be imposed on other entities suspected of supporting North Korea's arms endeavors. Additionally, increased collaboration with foreign governments and international institutions might be pursued to further strengthen the global response against North Korea's missile programs. Conclusion: The U.S. Treasury's decision to freeze Hong Kong Electronics' U.S. assets and prohibit transactions within the country marks a significant step towards curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions and preventing the misuse of the global financial system. This move serves as a reminder for other entities involved in such activities that their actions will not go unnoticed, and that such behavior will be met with severe consequences. The U.S. government remains determined to prevent the advancement of North Korea's arms programs, ensuring the protection and stability of global peace."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Answer: (b). small bottle had a lesser volume. In-detail answer: The large bottle held more liquid than the small bottle because the small bottle had a lesser volume. This implies that the capacity to contain liquids within the small bottle was inferior to the capacity of the large bottle. Volumes of containers are typically measured in liters, milliliters, or gallons, and they determine the amount of space available inside the container to store a substance, in this case, liquid. Consequently, if the large bottle has a greater volume than the small bottle, it means that it can hold a higher quantity of liquid. This fundamental relationship between volume and storage capacity plays a crucial role in various real-life scenarios, including liquid storage, pouring, or mixing. In summary, the determining factor in the quantity of liquid each bottle can hold lies in the difference in their respective volumes, with the small bottle's lesser volume leading to its diminished ability to contain liquid compared to the large bottle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Hemophilia results when a gene fails to produce the protein  needed for the blood to clot  ,or change from a liquid to a solid .The fault gene is passed from parents to children .People with hemophilia suffer uncontrolled bleeding .This can result in pain , tissue swelling  and permanent damage to joints and muscles.     One in every ten thousand males has the most common kind of hemophilia .It is extremely rare for females to have it. Patients can be treated with the missing clotting substance .They generally can lead normal lives.     Scientists say gene treatment may be a possible way to cure hemophilia in the future .Researchers consider hemophilia the best disease for gene treatment because it is caused by a single fault gene .Also ,only a small increase in the missing clotting substance could provide good results .They tested gene treatment in six patients with severe hemophilia.     First ,they removed skin cells from the patients' arms .The researchers grew the cells in the laboratory .They added copies of the needed gene taken from healthy people .Then they created hundreds of millions of genetically changed cells .They placed these cells into the patients' stomachs.After four months ,the amount of blood clotting substance in the blood increased in four of the six patients .Some of the patients reported a decrease in bleeding problems .However ,ten months later ,the clotting substance was no longer in the patients' blood .It is not clear if the implanted cells died or the added genes stopped working.     The researchers say the study showed that gene treatment is safe for people with the most common kind of hemophilia .But others expressed concern about the treatment because the effects were only temporary.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The New York Times In a relatively recent trend, galleries cooked up historical surveys. There was a fantastic Piero Manzoni retrospective at Gagosian and another devoted to the performance artist Stuart Sherman (1945-2001) at New York University’s 80WSE. Thanks to X Initiative, a smart, temporary exhibition project housed in Dia’s former Chelsea premises, we got a trippy soak in the early Super 8 films of Derek Jarman (1942-94) and a taser-hit of films by the 40-something Polish artist Artur Zmijewski. Mr. Zmijewski is one of several contemporary artists to make resonant solo appearances. Who could forget the young musicians playing Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” from the cutout center of moving pianos in an installation by the artist team of Allora & Calzadilla at Gladstone? Or the view of thousands of personal family effects — shoes, bottles, bandages, books — brought by the Beijing artist Song Dong to New York for his show “Waste Not” at the Museum of Modern Art? Inevitably, worthy events fell under the radar. Lutz Bacher’s retrospective “My Secret Life,” at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, was certainly one: with subjects from Vargas girls to Lee Harvey Oswald, it was chilly, strange and strong. A long overdue survey of the career of Daniel Joseph Martinez came in the form of a book called “A Life of Disobedience” (Hatje Cantz, Germany), the best way to catch the full impact of an artist for whom art, life and politics are inseparable. Other important retrospectives between covers: “The Importance of Being Iceland: Travel Essays in Art” (Semiotexte) by the poet-critic Eileen Myles; and “Hearts of the City: The Selected Writings of Herbert Muschamp” (Alfred A. Knopf), a grand compilation of essays by the brilliant former New York Times architecture critic who died in 2007. Inevitably there were disappointments. The first edition of the New Museum’s hotly anticipated contemporary survey, “The Generational: Younger Than Jesus,” was, despite some good artists, a lackluster affair of derivative, market-friendly works, like much else that this institution has delivered thus far. Unpleasant to watch was the way the art industry reacted to the economic crisis. There was talk about how corrections were healthy, how hard times could be the best times for reconsidering values, rethinking art and so on. The art world, deeply conventional and always fat at the top, had an opportunity to take some risks, change its game. But after few decent auctions, the talk stopped and the parties started again. Several small galleries had to close? So what! Artists can’t find jobs? They’ll live. But then, hardly anyone expects more than crass opportunism from this particular corner of the culture. Some people who do want more, however, came together for an intense one-day convocation, “The Creative Time Summit: Revolutions in Public Practice,” at the New York Public Library in October. From a wide-ranging international roster of artists, curators, critics, performers, scholars, anarchists and activists we heard about work in prisons and in United States-Mexican border communities, about housing rehabilitation and alternative-energy projects, about the global dissemination of sustaining goods and information, all through the agency of something defined in dozens of different ways as art. Visionary, for so long now a throwaway word, regained some meaning. It may not be exactly the word for Michael Jackson, a sometime artist who also happened to be a superstar pop performer and who died this year. But the art world, or at least many artists who took him as a subject — Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, John Waters, Paul McCarthy, Terence Koh, Cameron Jamie, Banksy and Kehinde Wiley, among them — owe him a big debt of thanks. He lent them his luster. Talent, ambition and heavy promotion raised him up; self-delusion, denial, drugs, racism, and gay panic brought him down: a very American trajectory. Even down he was huge, bigger than any painter or sculptor will ever be. That’s the reality. I wonder when the art world will figure it out. Meanwhile, tip of the hat to him. A version of this review appears in print on December 20, 2009, on Page AR30 of the New York edition with the headline: Times Are Tough? Bring On Vermeer And the Pianos.

Answer the following question: The longer the resistor, the more resistance it has.  Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are more or less ):   Terry adds a shorter resistor to the circuit. The resistor offer more or less than the other one? Answer:","output":"Answer: Less To understand the answer, let's first discuss the relationship between a resistor's length and its resistance. The resistance of a resistor is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. Mathematically, this can be represented by the formula: R = ρ * (L / A) where R is the resistance, ρ (rho) is the resistivity of the material, L is the length of the resistor, and A is the cross-sectional area. From the formula, we can see that as the length (L) of a resistor increases, its resistance (R) also increases. Conversely, as the length decreases, the resistance decreases. This is because a longer resistor has more material for electrons to pass through, which results in more collisions between the electrons and the material. The increased number of collisions causes the electrons to experience more resistance, leading to a higher resistance value. Now, let's go back to the question: Terry adds a shorter resistor to the circuit. Based on the information we discussed, a shorter resistor will have less length (L) than a longer resistor. According to the resistance formula (R = ρ * (L / A)), a decrease in length results in a decrease in resistance. Thus, the shorter resistor added by Terry will offer less resistance than the other one."},{"instruction":"Question: As the round object rolls down the ramp it will what?

The major division that resulted in the loss of identity of many Amish congregations occurred in the third quarter of the 19th century. The forming of factions worked its way out at different times at different places. The process was rather a \\"sorting out\\" than a split. Amish people are free to join another Amish congregation at another place that fits them best.  In the years after 1850, tensions rose within individual Amish congregations and between different Amish congregations. Between 1862 and 1878 yearly Dienerversammlungen (ministerial conferences) were held at different places, concerning how the Amish should deal with the tensions caused by the pressures of modern society. The meetings themselves were a progressive idea; for bishops to assemble to discuss uniformity was an unprecedented notion in the Amish church. By the first several meetings, the more traditionally minded bishops agreed to boycott the conferences.  The more progressive members, comprising approximately two-thirds of the group, became known by the name Amish Mennonite, and eventually united with the Mennonite Church, and other Mennonite denominations, mostly in the early 20th century. The more traditionally minded groups became known as the Old Order Amish. The Egli Amish had already started to withdraw from the Amish church in 1858. They soon drifted away from the old ways and changed their name to \\"Defenseless Mennonite\\" in 1908. Congregations that took no side in the division after 1862 formed the Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference in 1910 but dropped the word \\"Amish\\" from their name in 1957.  Because there was no division in Europe, the Amish congregations remaining there took the same way as the change-minded Amish Mennonites in North America and slowly merged with the Mennonites. The last Amish congregation in Germany to merge was the Ixheim Amish congregation, which merged with the neighboring Mennonite Church in 1937. Some Mennonite congregations, including most in Alsace, are descended directly from former Amish congregations.

Once a notorious member of a violent biker gang, Tom paid his dues in prison and now strives to leave his dark past behind. However, his efforts are constantly haunted by the ghosts of his former life. Jake, a teenager who has grown up without a father figure, is initially resentful of Tom's attempts to mend their relationship. To make matters worse, Jake is constantly bullied at school, while Tom, struggling financially, is forced to take on low-paying jobs to make ends meet. Act II: Despite the unfortunate circumstances in their lives, Tom and Jake slowly begin to bond over shared interests, such as motorbikes and classic movies. As time progresses, they find solace in each other's company, and their relationship strengthens. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Viktor, the ruthless leader of Tom's former biker gang, is relentlessly hunting him down. Unbeknownst to Tom, his ex-partner had been secretly embezzling money from the gang, pinning the blame on Tom before he left to serve time in prison. Viktor is now hell-bent on seeking vengeance against Tom for his apparent betrayal and theft. Act III: One day, while Tom is at work, Viktor and his gang discover his whereabouts and corner Jake at their house, planning to use him as leverage against Tom. Desperate to save his son, Tom is forced to face the demons from his past and confront Viktor and the gang. Relying on his instincts and skills he developed during his time in the gang, Tom cleverly outsmarts Viktor, picking off the gang members one by one, all while trying to stay alive. Meanwhile, Jake, already inspired by Tom's courage, uses his resourcefulness to escape confinement and help his father in the fight against the bikers. Act IV: In the film's climactic scene, Tom and Jake find themselves cornered, with Viktor closing in. Engaging in a fierce battle against the odds, father and son combine their strengths and cunning, ultimately defeating Viktor and the remaining gang members. The intense experience deepens the bond between Tom and Jake, resulting in Jake's newfound admiration and respect for his father. With their lives saved and their enemies vanquished, they can now truly start rebuilding their future together. Epilogue: Having weathered the storm, Tom and Jake continue to strengthen their relationship and overcome their struggles, both personal and financial.

It has unraveled at breakneck speed, as Russia moved against Ukraine, effectively annexed part of its territory, and put its smaller neighbor on the brink of war. Moving from disbelief to dismay to horror, Europeans lost whatever hopes and illusions they may have harbored that Russia was a predictable and cooperative partner. Instead, images are being invoked of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Hungary in 1956, and a new Cold War seems fully possible now. However far-fetched they may seem, these comparisons reflect a frantic search among Western politicians and experts for the underlying causes, rationales and consequences of Russia's actions in Ukraine. And it slowly dawns on Europe that it is witness to a sea change in Russian foreign policy that shakes the very foundations of the European order that emerged after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

Translate to Finnish","output":"Olemmeko saaneet oikean tiedon siitä, että 12 ympäristöministeriä on jo jättänyt tämän kysymyksen ja että vain kolme on edelleen mukana? Vastauksena kysymykseenne ilmoitan, että tietojemme mukaan 12 ympäristöministeriä on todellakin eronnut asiasta, ja vain kolme heistä on yhä edelleen mukana. Tämä voi olla merkki vakavista erimielisyyksistä ja sisäisestä jakautumisesta - erityisesti, jos nämä ministerit ovat peräisin samasta poliittisesta ryhmittymästä tai valtiosta. On myös mahdollista, että tämä tilanne johtuu erilaisista painotuksista, joita eri ministerit ovat antaneet ympäristökysymyksille ja niiden ratkaisemisen strategioille. Tällaisessa tapauksessa erilaisten näkökulmien ja lähestymistapojen vertailu voisi tarjota arvokasta tietoa siitä, mitkä strategiat voisivat olla tehokkaimpia ja mitkä eivät toimi yhtä hyvin. On kuitenkin tärkeää huomata, että ympäristökysymykset ovat monimutkaisia ja moniulotteisia, ja yksittäisillä ministereillä voi olla erilaisia syitä heidän päätökseensä erota. Voi olla, että jotkut heistä kokevat, etteivät he pysty edistämään tavoitteitaan ja näkemyksiään nykyisessä poliittisessa ilmapiirissä, kun taas toiset saattavat olla tyytymättömiä tietyille politiikoille tai niiden täytäntöönpanolle. Näin ollen on tärkeää tarkastella yksityiskohtaisesti tämänkaltaisen tilanteen syitä ja taustalla olevia tekijöitä. Erityisesti olisi hyödyllistä tarkastella, miksi nämä 12 ministeriä ovat päättäneet erota, millaisia eroavaisuuksia heidän näkemyksissään ja lähestymistavoissaan on verrattuna kolmeen jäljellä olevaan ministeriin, ja millaisia vaikutuksia heidän eroamisellaan voi olla ympäristöasioihin liittyviin päätöksiin ja politiikkoihin. Samalla on olennaista pohtia, miten tämä tilanne voi vaikuttaa ympäristöön ja kestävään kehitykseen liittyviin tavoitteisiin ja toimenpiteisiin laajemmassa mittakaavassa. Esimerkiksi voisimme pohtia, miten ministerien eri näkemykset ja lähestymistavat vaikuttavat kansainvälisten ympäristösopimusten ja -sääntöjen saavuttamiseen ja noudattamiseen, ja mitä tämä tarkoittaa valtioiden ja yksittäisten kansalaisten tasolla. Loppujen lopuksi on tärkeää, että kaikki osapuolet tunnustavat ympäristönsuojelun ja kestävän kehityksen merkityksen ja tarpeen yhteistyölle ja jakavat vastuun näistä kysymyksistä. Ympäristöministerien sisäiset erimielisyydet ja eroamiset voivat toisaalta heikentää tätä yhteistä lähestymistapaa, mutta toisaalta ne voivat myös tarjota mahdollisuuden erilaisten näkökulmien ja ratkaisumallien tarkasteluun ja arviointiin.

Summarize this article: CIRCLEVILLE, Piute County — Farmers in southern Utah are scratching their heads and trying to figure out what caused an unusual phenomenon in an irrigation pond. Earlier this week, Gary Dalton of Circleville discovered a mysterious crater that suddenly appeared under the water.      \\"The sun was just right,\\" Dalton said, \\"so, I saw this blasted thing that no one had ever seen.\\"      He noticed it after most of the water was drained from the pond for irrigation. Just beneath the surface he saw concentric circles in the pond botom with a diameter of about 25 feet. The outer ring is a circular depression filled with algae. An inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath, forming what looks startlingly like a small volcanic crater.      \\"My heck, I guess that's Martian art,\\" Dalton said. \\"I don't know.\\"      Experts from the Utah Geological Survey took a look and were initially baffled.      \\"Well, yeah, we've got several theories,\\" said veteran geologist Bill Lund as he examined the pond. \\"Most of them have gone up in smoke.\\"      Most of the theories were disposed of almost immediately.      The sun was just right, so I saw this blasted thing that no one had ever seen. –Gary Dalton, crater finder      Some had speculated that the feature was caused by a natural spring, pushing up from under the pond after being supercharged by recent rains. But Lund said that theory was quickly disproved by aerial photos that were taken before the pond was excavated two-and-a-half years ago.      \\"This was an alfalfa field and there was no spring here,\\" Lund said. \\"It's not a spring.\\"      Another theory was that a buried pipeline had been punctured during construction of the pond. But Lund said there is no pipeline.      Another possibility is that there was a burp of methane gas from decaying organic material under the pond. Lund strongly doubts that theory because the local geology isn't the type that sometimes causes such events. \\"If we were in coal country,\\" Lund said, \\"I'd be thinking about that a little harder but — you know — we're not.\\"      Earthquakes sometimes will cause similar features in sand or mud, due to liquefaction of soils.

Theories ranged from it being Martian art to a volcanic eruption– but now geologists believe there could be a simpler explanation.      They claim it was caused a geologic condition called 'collapsible soils' where refilling of a lake caused soil to collapse, creating a small eruption.      Gary Dalton and his two brothers recently discovered a round hole or crater in the bottom of their irrigation pond on their farmland in Circleville, in Piute County, Utah. The outer ring is a depression filled with algae. An inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath, forming what looks like a small volcanic crater      WHAT ARE 'COLLAPSIBLE SOILS'? This type of soil that can rapidly settle or collapse the ground is known as collapsible soil. 'Hydrocompactive soil' is the most common type of collapsible soil. The term hydro – implies the introduction or presence of water, which is the case with the mystery crater. The pond has been drained and refilled more than a dozen times in the last two years. The theory is that the repeated loading of weight on the soil eventually led some of the soil under the pond to collapse, creating a small eruption. 'As it collapsed and compacted,' said geologist Bill Lund, 'it forced some air and some water up and created this thing. It looks like a one-off thing. It just happened one time. That's it.'      The crater was discovered last month by Gary Dalton of Circleville after he saw an unusual hole in a lake.            'The sun was just right,' Mr Dalton said. 'So, I saw this blasted thing that no one had ever seen.'      He noticed it after most of the water was drained from the pond for irrigation. Just beneath the surface he saw concentric circles in the pond bottom with a diameter of about 25ft (7.6 metres).      The outer ring is a circular depression filled with algae. An inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath, forming what looks startlingly like a small volcanic crater.      'My heck, I guess that's Martian art,' Mr Dalton said.

But Mr Lund said that theory was quickly disproved by aerial photos that were taken before the pond was excavated two-and-a-half years ago.      'This was an alfalfa field and there was no spring here,' Mr Lund said. 'It's not a spring.'      The central depression is about 17.8cm (7in). The Dalton family were able to push the handle of a pitchfork another 33cm (13in) or so straight down in the soft centre      THE THEORIES SO FAR Some had speculated that the feature was caused by a natural spring, pushing up from under the pond after being supercharged by recent rains. Another theory was that a buried pipeline had been punctured during construction of the pond. But experts said there is no pipeline. Scientists then proposed that there was a burp of methane gas from decaying organic material under the pond. Earthquakes sometimes will cause similar features in sand or mud, due to liquefaction of soils. But there have no earthquakes in the Circleville area powerful enough.

Plot title: My Life In Ruins Movie plot: Georgia (Nia Vardalos) is a Greek American teacher who came to Greece to teach at a local college about Classic Greece. However, budget cuts caused her to be laid off and forced her to get a job as tour guide. She believes she has hit rock bottom when she loses her passion in everything. Informed by her boss, Maria (Bernice Stegers), that she ranks poorly as a guide because the tourists think she's boring, Georgia finds herself leading a tour around Greece with an assorted group of misfit tourists whom she believes is a failure since they seem to care more about buying T-shirts than learning about history and culture. Instead, she wishes to have a good group of Canadian tourists whom seems to be more engaged in history and culture than wanting to go shopping for souvenirs and hang out at the beach. Maria disagrees with Georgia's assessment, informing her that they are more interested in Nico (Alistair McGowan), a rival male tour guide also working for Maria because he's engaging in tours. As Georgia's tour departs, her driver is injured in an accident and is replaced by another driver, Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis). In a clash of personalities and cultures, everything seems to go wrong and Georgia is on the verge of quitting as she can't connect with the group to get them to appreciate Greece and its culture. This is made worse when she voices her disgust with Maria for favoring Nico over her in letting his group stay in better hotels than her group. After being ignored again, Georgia decides to send a letter to inform her that she's quitting at the end of her tour. One day, an older traveller named Irv Gideon (Richard Dreyfuss), helps Georgia see why she can't connect with the group: she finds them annoying and is bored with her current job. Therefore, he shows her how to have fun and teach her how to be more engaging to the tourists. This helps Georgia learn more about the current group of tourists she has and open her eyes to the different places where they come from. In doing so, she also teaches them the...

How to overcome shyness around guys  Realize that not everyone is looking at you.  This can be the hardest part about talking to a guy, is that it can feel like everyone is watching you. Most often, this isn't true. Pick from: -- People are most often too absorbed in their own lives and preoccupations to notice whether you're nervous or doing something weird. However, most of the time when people are shy, the shyness isn't visible to others.; -- Instead, the focus is on how you look. Instead of looking over his shoulder or glancing up periodically, look at his body, noting his complexion.; -- When people catch you looking at them, their eyes dart back to their own. Others will assume you're more attractive, and that you're more confident than some of the other guys you're observing.; -- Staring a guy directly in the eye can make you look like you're hiding something, which may lead to a level of shyness. That said, it's okay to admit that everybody's constantly watching your body.; Answer:","output":"People are most often too absorbed in their own lives and preoccupations to notice whether you're nervous or doing something weird. However, most of the time when people are shy, the shyness isn't visible to others. It is essential to remember this and practice self-compassion when feeling anxious or shy in social situations, especially around guys. One effective way to overcome shyness around guys is to improve your self-confidence. This may involve setting small, achievable goals in social situations and gradually working your way up to interacting with guys in more challenging contexts. For example, you might start by merely making eye contact with a guy you find attractive. As your confidence grows, you can then try initiating a conversation, sharing a joke, or engaging in a more in-depth discussion. Another strategy to overcome shyness is to learn and practice effective communication skills. This can include active listening, demonstrating empathy, and asking open-ended questions. By incorporating these skills into your interactions with guys, you can create more meaningful connections and become more engaged in conversations. This, in turn, can help to reduce feelings of shyness and awkwardness. It is also crucial to develop a healthy mindset towards rejection. When approaching guys, there is always a possibility that they might not be interested in engaging with you or that the conversation may not go as planned. Accepting this fact and understanding that it's a normal part of social interactions can help to alleviate some of the fear and anxiety associated with shyness. Additionally, adopting a growth mindset can be beneficial when trying to overcome shyness around guys. By viewing each interaction as an opportunity to learn and grow, you can focus more on the process of improving your social skills rather than fixating on the potential outcome of a particular encounter. Another helpful tactic is to engage in activities where you share common interests with the guys around you. This can provide a natural context for conversations and help to create a sense of camaraderie and connection. Finally, consider seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional to help understand and address the root causes of your shyness. They can provide guidance, encouragement, and tools to help you develop the confidence and skills necessary to overcome your shyness around guys. Remember that overcoming shyness is a gradual process, and it is essential to practice patience and self-compassion as you work towards your goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: are radio waves electromagnetic waves or sound waves?","output":"Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave, not sound waves. To provide a comprehensive understanding of their differences and the nature of radio waves, let's delve into both electromagnetic waves and sound waves' properties. Electromagnetic waves are a form of energy that travels through space in the form of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. They are produced by the interaction of electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of the wave's propagation. These waves do not require a medium, meaning they can travel through the vacuum of space. Electromagnetic waves comprise a broad spectrum that includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type of wave varies in wavelength and frequency. Radio waves are at the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum, characterized by their long wavelengths (ranging from about one millimeter to 100 kilometers) and low frequency (ranging from about 3 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz). They are primarily used for various forms of communication, including television, radio broadcasts, satellite transmissions, and mobile data. Radio waves are generated by devices such as antennas, which create oscillating electric currents that produce varying electric and magnetic fields. On the other hand, sound waves are mechanical waves, produced by vibrations that cause pressure changes in a medium, like air, water, or solid objects. The pressure changes travel through the medium as a series of compressions and rarefactions. Due to their mechanical nature, sound waves require a medium to propagate. They cannot travel through a vacuum. The properties of sound waves, such as speed and attenuation, depend on the medium's characteristics through which they travel. In summary, radio waves are electromagnetic waves, similar to light and other forms of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. They do not require a medium for propagation and travel through space as oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Sound waves are mechanical waves that result from vibrations and require a medium for propagation. These fundamental differences make it clear that radio waves and sound waves are distinct types of waves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. James Rush. PUBLISHED:. 04:06 EST, 24 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:28 EST, 24 September 2013. The father of a four-year-old boy allegedly starved to death by his mother has told a court he contacted social services about his son but was told it was a 'private matter'. Aftab Khan told Bradford Crown Court he confronted Amanda Hutton about how she was looking after Hamzah Khan. But he said she told him to mind his own business and banned him from the house less than a year before the little boy died in December 2009. Aftab Khan (left) told Bradford Crown Court how he confronted Amanda Hutton (right) about how she was looking after Hamzah Khan. Mr Khan was giving evidence at the trial of Hutton, who is accused of the manslaughter of her son. The jury has been told Hamzah's mummified body was discovered in a cot in Hutton's Bradford home in September 2011. Mr Khan told the court how he had separated from Hutton after he was charged with assaulting her. He said he was initially stopped from visiting Hutton due to a court order but did start to go and see his son when they moved to a new home in Bradford in March 2009. Mr Khan told the jury his former partner was not looking after Hamzah properly. 'I said \\"look at the state of him - you're not looking after him\\" and she told me to get out,' he told the jury. The court has heard Hamzah Khan's mummified body was discovered in a cot in Hutton's Bradford home in September 2011. The mechanic and taxi driver told the court that it was his concerns about his son that had led to the arguments resulting in his arrest in 2008 and eventual conviction for battery. He said: 'She wasn't bathing him. She wasn't changing him.' Mr Khan said he would only see Hutton feeding Hamzah milk. He said his former partner drank cider and vodka heavily, especially after the death of her mother. 'She'd be absolutely out of it,' he said. Hutton, who denies manslaughter, sat in the dock dressed in black, watching Mr Khan give his evidence. Mr Khan told the jury he contacted social services once about the condition of Hamzah but said he was ignored. Mr Khan was giving evidence at Bradford Crown Court (pictured) at the trial of Hutton, who is accused of the manslaughter of her son. The jury has heard how, when Mr Khan was arrested for attacking Hutton in 2008, he told police he was going to contact social services about his son. A senior police officer told the court there was no record he ever made the call. Yesterday, Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked Khan whether he did contact social services. He said: 'I remember ringing social services up. They said it was a private matter. 'Social services are never bothered about cases like this.' 'They weren't bothered. Social services are never bothered in cases like these. I'd given up at that time' - Aftab Khan. Pressed by Mr Greaney, he said: 'I clearly remember. There's no record of it. They weren't bothered, they weren't interested. I'd given up at that time.' Mr Greaney QC also asked Mr Khan about urging police to 'go and check' on Hamzah. 'Yes, so they could see the neglect for themselves,' he answered. Mr Greaney asked Mr Khan about a text message he sent to Hutton which read:. 'Don't worry it's not me who's going to land you in the s***, you're. going to do that yourself. You've turned into the biggest liar, stop. drinking.' The text also asked what Hamzah had 'had' and added: 'Think about what you're doing to everybody.' Mr Greaney asked him: 'What do you mean by \\"had\\"?' Mr Khan answered: 'I meant what food, had he been fed properly?' Mr Khan rejected claims in court that he was a 'wife batterer'. Mr Khan said he was initially stopped from visiting Hutton (pictured) due to a court order but did start to go and see his son when they moved to a new home in Bradford in March 2009. Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, asked him: 'You were a wife batterer and she was a battered wife, cowed by your violence.' Mr Khan said: 'If I was a wife batterer why am I not standing next to her (Hutton)?' Mr Meadowcroft replied: 'Perhaps you ought to be.' The defence barrister put it to Mr Khan that he had been violent towards his client throughout their 20-year relationship, but he denied this. 'I've come here to answer questions about my child,' he said. 'Everyone knows what happened. You've got damning evidence against Miss Hutton but you're still trying to point the finger at me. I'm not having it.' Mr Khan repeatedly insisted that he tried to alert police and social services to his son's plight but was not listened to. He said: 'A year down the line, what happened? A child died.' Mr Khan was asked again about the call he said he made to social services. He said: 'This country is run for women. A man's got no rights in this country.' Mr Meadowcroft told him: 'You were the father of the family. You were there. Had you actually thought that (Hamzah's neglect)? What did you do about it?' Mr Khan told the court: 'The police wouldn't believe me. No one would believe me. 'I know I made one phone call. If the police weren't going to believe me, who else is going to believe me? I gave up. 'The system failed my son. Did the school check up? Did social services check up? I lost my total confidence in the system.' Mr Khan said he even helped Hutton before the court case, giving her money to buy clothes for the trial. 'I've helped her a lot. If I was a violent man, I wouldn't have helped.' Mr Khan (pictured) rejected claims in court that he was a 'wife batterer' He told the court: 'She's done it all. Put me on one side. You've got so much evidence against her it's unbelievable.' Deepinder Kaur told the court Hamzah was small and did not eat very much in the months before his death. Miss Kaur, 24, a former girlfriend of Hutton's son Qaiser, 22, said the boy would eat half a cheese and onion pasty in the evening and half a banana in the morning. She said that during the day he would eat 'biscuits or whatever's lying around'. Miss Kaur said that despite being nearly four at the time, in February 2009, 'he looked like a baby' and would often wear a baby-gro. 'He was very light,' she said. 'He didn't weigh much.' Asked where Hamzah spent his days, Miss Kaur said he was either in front of the TV in the living room or locked in a bedroom with the light turned off. Asked whether Hutton explained why he was locked upstairs, she said: 'She said it was because he'd been naughty. But she didn't say exactly what he'd done.' Pc Maria Furness, of West Yorkshire Police, told the jury she attended Hutton's house to perform a welfare check but found Hamzah to be 'fed well, clean, healthy looking and there was an appropriate adult in the address'. The officer said that appropriate adult was Tariq, Hamzah's brother, who told her he was his uncle. Pc Furness said she was at the house for about 30 to 45 minutes when she made the visit about eight months before Hamzah's death. Hutton denies manslaughter. The case continues.

So, 62 * 2 = 124. 2. The second element in the list (58) is also positive, so I'll multiply it by 2 as well. So, 58 * 2 = 116. 3. The third element (-82) is a negative number, so I need to multiply it by -3 as per the rule. So, -82 * -3 = 246. 4. The fourth element (36) is positive, so it'll be multiplied by 2. 36 * 2 = 72. 5. The fifth element (42) is positive, so it'll be multiplied by 2. 42 * 2 = 84. 6. The last element (1) is positive, so it'll be multiplied by 2. 1 * 2 = 2. Now, the output list will be a combination of these results: [124, 116, 246, 72, 84, 2].

The development came hours before President Donald Trump called off the highly anticipated meeting. The South Korean government welcomed the North's unilateral nuclear concession to help facilitate a broader agreement with the United States to completely end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for ending punishing sanctions and security guarantees. \\"We are hoping that this action will become the opportunity for complete denuclearization in the future,\\" South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said. However, while the closure of the nuclear test complex is a significant symbolic gesture, analysts are skeptical it will seriously inhibit the Kim Jong Un government's ability to carry out further nuclear tests in the future. \\"That renders the test site unusable, but not forever and it's not like North Korea has a shortage of mountains or people to make new tunnels,\\" said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, during an interview with Vice News. North Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri underground site that includes at least two extensive tunnel systems, according the 38 North website that monitors the North's nuclear activities. Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield. There were reports that the last nuclear test in September of 2017 triggered a tunnel collapse rendering the site unusable, but analysts say there were still two other tunnels that could be used for future tests. Earlier this year North Korean leader Kim Jong Un...

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The closure of an industry may have indirect effects on the forest fire process. The specific impact would depend on the nature of the industry.  1. If the industry contributes to pollution or climate change, its closure could lead to a reduction in air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions. This could potentially result in reduced instances of fires or reduced intensity of fires in the long term. However, it may not have an immediate effect on an already ongoing forest fire. 2. If the industry is involved in deforestation, logging, or land conversion, its closure could prevent further forest degradation, which may have an impact on the severity and spread of forest fires in the long term. A healthier and less fragmented forest may be more resistant to fires, and with fewer human activities, there could be a reduction in the chances of a fire caused by human actions. 3. If the industry is directly involved in fire management, wildfire prevention, or firefighting efforts, its closure could negatively impact the ability to prevent or control forest fires. This could potentially lead to more severe and widespread fires. 4. If the industry is unrelated to forest fires, its closure might not have any direct or indirect effect on the process. In conclusion, the perturbation of an industry closing would have varying indirect effects on the forest fire process depending on the nature of the industry. Some industries may have a positive impact on preventing or reducing fires when closed, while others might result in negative consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In week 5, the Bears recorded the highest margin of victory of the season, defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars 41-3. In the first quarter, the Bears scored first on a Robbie Gould 32-yard field goal, though Jacksonville would respond in the next quarter on Josh Scobee's 31-yard kick. In the second half, the Bears broke the deadlock by kicking another field goal and cornerback Charles Tillman returning a Blaine Gabbert interception 36 yards for a touchdown, breaking former Bears safety Mike Brown's franchise record for the most pick-sixes in a career. Tillman also tied Donnell Woolford for the most interceptions by a cornerback in team history. In the fourth quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 10-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Chicago would then extend their lead on Cutler's 24-yard pass to Brandon Marshall to increase the lead to 27-3. Bears linebacker Lance Briggs would then intercept Gabbert and score on a 36-yard return. Briggs and Tillman would become the first pair in league history to return interceptions for touchdowns in consecutive games, and the Bears became the first team in NFL history to return five interceptions for touchdowns in the first five games of a season. The Bears would close out the game with backup running back Armando Allen scoring on a 46-yard touchdown run. The victory improved the team's record to 4-1. The victory is the most lopsided win for the Bears since their 1985 44-0 victory over the Cowboys, and the 38 points scored in the second half are the most since the team scoring 49 second half points in the 1941 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction. The wet surface may allow your shoes to slide more easily.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What would happen if all the oil leaked out of a running car engine?\\" is \\"It would start a fire\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, if all the oil leaked out of a running car engine, it would not necessarily start a fire. However, the lack of oil would lead to a significant increase in friction between the moving parts of the engine. This increased friction would cause the engine parts to wear out more quickly, and it would also generate more heat due to the increased contact between the different surfaces. This excess heat could potentially cause the engine to overheat, which may lead to various issues like engine failure, decreased fuel efficiency, and potentially damage to other car components. While it is not explicitly stated that the heat generated due to friction would start a fire, it could definitely cause a range of problems and damage for the car engine. To avoid these issues, it is essential to maintain an adequate level of oil in your car's engine. The oil serves as a lubricant, reducing the friction between the surfaces of moving parts and ensuring that the engine operates smoothly and efficiently. It is important to regularly check and change your engine oil to prevent excessive wear and potential damage to your vehicle's engine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The Arcus Foundation is a charitable foundation dedicated to promoting social justice and inclusion for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people worldwide. It aims to address the wide range of laws and policies that impact the LGBT community, which can vary significantly from one country or territory to another. Some of these laws address the legal recognition of same-sex marriages or partnerships, while others impose severe penalties for engaging in same-sex romantic or sexual activities, or for identifying as LGBT. The issues that the Arcus Foundation focuses on include, but are not limited to: 1. Legal recognition of same-sex marriages and partnerships: This is an important aspect of LGBT rights, as it confers several benefits such as inheritance rights, pension benefits, healthcare benefits, and immigration rights to same-sex couples. In recent years, there has been an increasing number of countries that have legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and several European countries. 2. Anti-discrimination laws: Discrimination against LGBT individuals can manifest in various forms, such as in the workplace, educational institutions, and access to services. The Arcus Foundation supports efforts to establish and strengthen anti-discrimination legislation that protects the rights of LGBT people. 3. Gender identity and expression: Transgender and gender non-conforming individuals face unique challenges and discrimination that often go beyond those faced by cisgender LGBT people. The Arcus Foundation supports initiatives that promote the rights of transgender individuals, including legal recognition of their gender identity and access to appropriate healthcare services. 4. Decriminalization of homosexuality: In some countries, homosexuality is still criminalized, which means that same-sex sexual activity or relationships are illegal. Penalties for such acts range from fines and imprisonment to corporal punishment and even the death penalty. The Arcus Foundation works towards decriminalizing homosexuality worldwide, advocating for the abolition of these harmful laws and policies. 5. Conversion therapy: Conversion therapy is a widely discredited practice that aims to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. The Arcus Foundation opposes conversion therapy and advocates for its ban in countries where it is still legal or practiced. 6. Violence against the LGBT community: Many LGBT individuals face violence and hate crimes solely due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. The Arcus Foundation supports organizations and initiatives that work towards reducing violence and hate crimes against the LGBT community, such as through education, community outreach, and policy reforms. In summary, the Arcus Foundation is committed to supporting initiatives that address the diverse laws and policies affecting the LGBT community around the world, from legalizing same-sex marriage to eliminating discrimination and violence. By providing funding, resources, and advocacy, the foundation strives to create a more inclusive and just society where LGBT individuals can live freely and without fear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What type of animal is the Alaskan husky and Small Münsterländer? The answer is:","output":"The Alaskan Husky and Small Münsterländer are two distinct breeds of dogs characterized by their unique traits, appearances, and historical backgrounds. Both breeds serve specific purposes and are highly valued by their owners for their respective qualities. The Alaskan Husky, as the name suggests, originates from Alaska and is primarily a sled dog breed. Alaskan Huskies are renowned for their incredible stamina, speed, and endurance in harsh winter climates. They have been selectively bred over many generations, focusing on their work performance rather than conforming to a specific breed standard. Consequently, their physical features can vary significantly, but they generally have a lean and muscular build. Alaskan Huskies have a medium to a large body size, standing around 20 to 24 inches at the shoulder and weighing around 35 to 60 pounds. Alaskan Huskies have a double coat of fur that insulates them from the cold – the outer coat being dense and relatively short, while the undercoat is soft and warm. Their eye colors can range from blue to brown, and in some cases, they even have heterochromatic eyes, where each eye is a different color. It's important to note that Alaskan Huskies are not officially recognized as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) or any other major kennel clubs due to their variable appearances and the emphasis on performance over appearance. On the other hand, the Small Münsterländer, also known as the Kleiner Münsterländer Vorstehhund, hails from the Münster region in Germany. This breed is a versatile hunting dog, adept at pointing, retrieving, and tracking game. Small Münsterländers are part of the Continental pointing dog group and have a long history that dates back to as early as the 16th century. They possess strong hunting instincts and are highly valued for their adaptability to various terrains, including swamps, forests, and fields. Small Münsterländers are medium-sized dogs, standing at around 19 to 21 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 40 to 60 pounds. They have a sleek and muscular build, with a characteristic feathering on their ears, legs, and tails. The breed has a dense, wavy medium-length coat that is primarily white with patches of solid brown or brown roan. Small Münsterländers have expressive brown eyes that reflect their intelligence and attentive nature. In contrast to the Alaskan Husky, the Small Münsterländer is recognized as a breed by major kennel clubs, including the AKC. Their versatile hunting abilities, coupled with their loyal, friendly, and intelligent personalities, also make them affectionate companions and family pets. In summary, the Alaskan Husky is a highly efficient sled dog originating from Alaska, known for its stamina and adaptability to cold climates. On the other hand, the Small Münsterländer is a versatile and skilled German hunting dog with a storied history and an officially recognized breed standard. While both breeds share some similarities in their intelligence and work ethic, they differ significantly in their appearances, breed recognition, and primary functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become.

But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. The Obama administration has set a goal of admitting as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees to the United States by the fall.Respondents of the surveys also were sharply divided on whether they would be willing to accept refugees from Syria in particular, with 61 percent of Republicans saying the U.S. should not accept Syrian refugees, compared to 27 percent of Democrats. Trump supporters again... Question: After the end of the story, Trump probably does what with immigration? Answer: Answer:","output":"After the end of the story, it is likely that Trump continues to advocate for a temporary ban on immigration from certain areas with a history of terrorism and pushes for stricter immigration policies. This includes suspending immigration from countries like Syria, Iraq, and Libya, as he considers the influx of refugees and immigrants from these regions to potentially pose a serious threat to the United States. Trump's stance is supported by 77% of his voters who oppose taking in refugees, while a majority of Democrats and a recent Brookings Institution survey show a more welcoming attitude towards refugees."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Two colleagues gave blood for an emergency. Ned got infected with HIV because they re-used a needle. His friend Nate was not infected.  Which colleague had a virus that is transmitted by sexual contact?  Hint: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ . Answer:","output":"Step 1: Review the information provided in the question and the hint. Step 2: Identify the relevant information - HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and contact with infected bodily fluids such as blood. Step 3: Analyze the situation - In this case, both Ned and Nate gave blood for an emergency. Ned got infected with HIV due to the re-use of a needle. Nate did not get infected. Step 4: Based on the information, we can determine that Ned got infected with the virus (HIV) that is transmitted by sexual contact as well as contact with infected blood due to the re-use of a needle. Although the transmission in this situation was through blood contact, HIV can also be transmitted by sexual contact. So, the answer is Ned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Strolling across the bridge from this side offers stunning views of lower Manhattan's towering skyline.  Additionally, Brooklyn Bridge Park and Cadman Plaza Park on the Brooklyn side are picturesque places to start your trip. If you're walking with friends, arrange to meet up at either park. The pedestrian entrance is at the northeast corner of Cadman Plaza, so this park is the most convenient meeting place. While Brooklyn Bridge Park is a short walk from the bridge's pedestrian entrance, it offers the best views of the bridge itself. While the Manhattan side sports superior skyline views, Brooklyn is packed with things to do. If you're starting in Manhattan, stroll across the bridge and lounge around Brooklyn's waterfront, which is lined with parks and vibrant neighborhoods.  Jane's Carousel is a popular waterfront destination, and it's an excellent activity for kids. The neighborhoods surrounding the bridge are also packed with restaurants, shops, galleries, and other attractions. While you could walk briskly and cross the bridge in about 20 minutes, give yourself an hour or so. That way, you can stroll slowly and appreciate the views. Once you get to the pedestrian walkway, look for the stenciled markings that designate the bike and pedestrian lanes. Both lanes are narrow, and you'll need to stay in your lane to avoid speedy cyclists.   Be sure to stay on the right-hand side of the bridge to avoid oncoming pedestrian and cyclist traffic. If you're walking with kids, hold hands to avoid accidents. At the start of your walk, the bridge's incline will be too low to see much of the view across the river. Whether you depart from Brooklyn or Manhattan, these first few minutes are perfect for people-watching. Seize the opportunity to peek at passersby. Look for locals briskly crossing the bridge to run errands in the neighboring borough, or try to figure out where nearby tourists are from. If you started from the Brooklyn side, lower Manhattan's skyline will come into view as the bridge's elevation increases.  Look for the Freedom Tower, the Woolworth Building, and the Financial District's towers. The Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and other iconic Manhattan skyscrapers will also be visible. If you're heading toward Brooklyn, you'll see its park-lined waterfront, charming neighborhoods, and growing skyline. The Brooklyn Bridge is an architectural wonder, so take the time to admire its impressive neo-Gothic structure. When it opened, it was dubbed the eighth wonder of the world, and its towers were the tallest buildings in the Western hemisphere! If you started from the Brooklyn side, look toward the left, or to the west. If you started from Manhattan, look toward the right, or east side, to find the Statue of Liberty.  Though she'll look tiny, you'll get a clear view of the Statue of Liberty from the span of the bridge between its central towers.","output":"Starting at the Brooklyn side of the bridge offers stunning views of lower Manhattan's skyline, and the bridge itself is lined with parks, neighborhoods, attractions, and architectural wonders, making it an enjoyable walking experience."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: I have known, and admired, Julia Busuttil Nishimura, for many years now and always felt connected through our love of Italian food, Tuscany (Julia lived in Florence and in Orbetello, just 10 minutes away from where we lived in Porto Ercole while I was writing Acquacotta) and Japan. So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already. She is a woman after my own heart. Her book inspires you to give it a go. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

The A). dye colored his hair, as it was specifically formulated to alter the hair's hue by penetrating the hair shaft and depositing color molecules. The hair dye achieved the desired vibrant shade of green, as it was designed to do. Hair dye, such as the one he used, comes in a variety of shades and colors, and is commonly used by individuals who wish to change the look of their hair temporarily or permanently. It works by interacting with the hair's natural pigments, either enhancing or neutralizing them in order to produce the chosen color. On the other hand, B). the conditioner did not color his hair, as its primary purpose is to improve the texture, manageability, and overall health of the hair. Conditioners are typically formulated with various nourishing ingredients like oils, proteins, and silicones, which help to smooth, detangle, and repair the hair. Some conditioners might contain color-depositing agents, but in this case, the conditioner he used did not contain any colorant. Moreover, using a conditioner after dyeing hair is a common practice, as it helps to seal the hair cuticles and lock the color in place. By doing so, it ensures that the color lasts longer and prevents it from fading or becoming dull between salon appointments or home coloring sessions. It also helps to counteract the harshness and potential damage that can be caused by the chemicals present in some hair dyes, by providing much-needed hydration and nourishment to the hair.
