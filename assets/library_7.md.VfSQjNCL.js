Havana (CNN) -- Cuban officials have accused the U.S. government of bizarre plots over the years, such as trying to kill Fidel Castro with exploding cigars. On Wednesday, they said Washington is using a new weapon against the island: spam. \\"It's overloading the networks, which creates bad service and affects our customers,\\" said Daniel Ramos Fernandez, chief of security operations at the Cuban government-run telecommunications company ETECSA. At a news conference Wednesday, Cuban officials said text messaging platforms run by the U.S. government threatened to overwhelm Cuba's creaky communications system and violated international conventions against junk messages. The spam, officials say, comes in the form of a barrage of unwanted text messages, some political in nature.

With each passing day, the spam attacks intensified, and tensions between the U.S. and Cuba rose, as the citizens of the island demanded answers and a reprieve from the relentless electronic assault. It was during a final, desperate meeting between American and Cuban diplomats when an unlikely hero emerged—Dr. Lourdes Moreno, a brilliant Cuban cybersecurity expert—who, through tireless work and incredible ingenuity, managed to penetrate the complex web of misinformation and trace the spam campaign back to its source. In an unexpected twist that no one saw coming, it was discovered that the malicious endeavor was orchestrated not by the U.S. government, as Havana had so vehemently accused, but by an underground criminal network whose sole purpose was to destabilize both nations and undermine the already fragile diplomatic relations between them. Relieved that the culprit had been unmasked, Cuba and the United States agreed to join forces to combat this shared threat, forging a new bond between former adversaries, and proving that even in the darkest of times, hope can rise from the ashes of suspicion, rewiring the connections that bind us all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In April 1918, the British Cabinet, in the face of the crisis caused by the German Spring Offensive, attempted with a dual policy to simultaneously link the enactment of conscription into Ireland with the implementation of Home Rule, as outlined in the report of the Irish Convention of 8 April 1918. This further alienated Irish nationalists and produced mass demonstrations during the Conscription Crisis of 1918. In the 1918 general election Irish voters showed their disapproval of British policy by giving Sinn Féin 70%  of Irish seats, 25 of these uncontested. Sinn Féin won 91% of the seats outside of Ulster on 46.9% of votes cast, but was in a minority in Ulster, where unionists were in a majority.

Mamoudou Gassama won widespread praise after climbing the outside of the building to save the four-year-old.      Video showed him being cheered on by spectators as he pulled himself from balcony to balcony to the fourth floor.      After meeting him at the Elysee Palace, President Emmanuel Macron said he would be made a naturalised citizen.      He personally thanked Mr Gassama, gave him a medal for courage and said he would also be offered a role in the fire service.      Mr Gassama is said to have arrived in France last year, taking the long and dangerous journey to Europe via a boat over the Mediterranean to Italy.      The drama that thrust him to fame unfolded on Saturday evening on a street in the north of the city.      Mr Gassama said he had been walking past when he saw a crowd gathered in front of the building.      He told Mr Macron: \\"I just didn't have time to think, I ran across the road to go and save him.      You may also like:      \\"I just climbed up and thank God, God helped me. The more I climbed the more I had the courage to climb up higher, that's it,\\" he added.      He said that the boy was crying when he hauled him to safety and had also suffered an injured foot.      Firefighters arrived to find the child had already been rescued.      \\"Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,\\" a spokesperson said.

The father has been questioned by police on suspicion of leaving his child unattended, judicial sources say. The mother was not in Paris at the time, it is believed.      Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was among those to praise the 22-year-old's heroism and said she had called him to thank him.      She referred to him as the \\"Spiderman of the 18th\\", referring to the Paris district where the rescue took place, calling him an \\"example for all citizens\\".      France's new Malian hero      Alex Duval Smith, West Africa correspondent, BBC News      Mr Gassama's four-storey dash is a reminder of another Malian hero who gained national prominence in January 2015 during an extremist attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris.      A young Malian employee, Lassana Bathily, was credited with saving the lives of six hostages including a baby when he led them to a safe hiding place, escaped, then directed gendarmes to their rescue.      Two weeks later - after six years of struggling to secure legal residency in France - Mr Bathily was given a medal and a French passport by then President François Hollande.      In 2016, he wrote a book ''Je ne suis pas un heros'' (I am no hero) and created a charity whose first project was to provide irrigation for his home village in western Mali.      Like Mr Bathily's selfless leadership to save the hostages, Mr Gassama's heroic climb to save the boy cements the image of Mali as a country with a culture of old-fashioned public spiritedness. ||||| Footage shows Mamoudou Gassama, a Malian immigrant, climbing up to a fourth-floor balcony to bring the child to safety      A young man has been hailed a hero after he scaled the facade of a building to save a four-year-old child hanging from a fourth-floor balcony.

Tracked down by reporters 24 hours after the rescue, Gassama said he had acted without thinking. “I saw all these people shouting, and cars sounding their horns. I climbed up like that and, thank God, I saved the child,” he said.      “I felt afraid when I saved the child ... [when] we went into the living room, I started to shake, I could hardly stand up, I had to sit down,” he added.

The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 at a valuation of 4.06 billion.  - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations.

It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Question: -  The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil - This combination of water and minerals flows from the stem into the leaf - Carbon dioxide enters the leaf - Light, water and minerals, and the carbon dioxide all mix together - This mixture forms sugar (glucose) which is what the plant eats - Oxygen goes out of the leaf through the stomata -   What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process in this plant system is the absorption of water and minerals from the soil by the roots. This initial process plays a critical role in the overall health, growth, and functioning of the plant. In order to better understand this first step, it's important to have a deeper knowledge of the root system and its structure. Plant roots are composed of several specialized cells and tissues that work together to achieve various functions, including the uptake of water and minerals. Roots are generally divided into three main areas: the root cap, the zone of elongation, and the zone of maturation (with root hairs). The roots perform a dual function in plant growth, anchoring the plant in the soil and providing it with essential nutrients and water. The tiny root hairs, which are outgrowths of specialized cells called trichoblasts, are especially important in absorption. They help increase the root's surface area in contact with the soil, allowing for greater absorption of nutrients and water. The uptake of water and minerals is accomplished through two pathways: the apoplastic and the symplastic pathway. The apoplastic route involves the movement of water and minerals through the cell walls and intercellular spaces without crossing any cell membranes, while the symplastic pathway involves passing through the cells' plasma membranes via plasmodesmata, small channels that connect adjacent plant cells. Once absorbed, the water and minerals, also known as the xylem sap, are transported from the roots to other parts of the plant through the xylem, a complex network of interconnected, water-conducting cells. The xylem sap moves upwards through the plant in response to a combination of factors such as transpiration (the loss of water from plant leaves), root pressure (the result of active pumping of water and ions into the xylem), and capillary action (the upward movement of water through narrow spaces due to the forces of cohesion, adhesion, and surface tension). In summary, the first step in the process involves the roots absorbing water and minerals from the soil. This is a crucial function that enables plants to grow and access the resources they need for other metabolic processes, such as photosynthesis. The journey of water and minerals from the soil into the plant starts from the root hairs and through different pathways in the root structure, ultimately reaching the xylem for transportation to other plant parts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ich möchte außerdem darauf hinweisen, dass der Rat im Juni dieses Jahres Schlussfolgerungen angenommen hat, mit dem Titel \\"Chancengleichheit für Frauen und Männer: aktives und würdiges Altern\\", um die Versorgung mit qualitativen Pflegediensten in Verbindung mit häuslicher Pflege für ältere Menschen zu erleichtern, unter Berücksichtigung der besonderen Bedürfnisse älterer Männer und Frauen. Translate this to English?","output":"I would also like to point out that the Council adopted conclusions in June of this year, titled \\"Equal opportunities for women and men: active and dignified aging,\\" aiming to facilitate the provision of quality care services in conjunction with home care for older people, taking into account the specific needs of older men and women. In this context, the Council's conclusions highlight the importance of promoting equal opportunities for both women and men as they age and ensure active and dignified aging. This can be achieved by addressing several aspects, including the facilitation of quality care services and home care for the elderly. Regarding the provision of quality care services, some key points can be emphasized. Firstly, it is crucial to ensure that care services are accessible, adequate, and tailored to the specific needs of older women and men. This can involve, for example, providing the necessary infrastructure, investing in the training and development of care professionals, and ensuring efficient coordination among different stakeholders, such as care providers, local authorities, and healthcare institutions. Another important aspect is to facilitate the combination of professional and personal life for those who care for older family members, with a particular focus on promoting gender equality in care responsibilities. This can be achieved by implementing measures that support work-life balance, such as flexible working arrangements, paid leave for caregiving, and access to affordable and quality care services for their family members. In addition to this, it is crucial to raise awareness and promote a positive image of aging and older people in society. This can help challenge ageist stereotypes and foster respect and appreciation for the contributions and experiences of older women and men. Public campaigns, educational programs, and intergenerational exchanges can be beneficial in this regard. Furthermore, it is vital to support research and innovation in the field of aging and care services. This can help to identify and address the specific needs of older women and men, develop innovative care solutions, and improve the overall quality of care services provided to older people. Investing in technology and digitalization can also contribute to this goal, by enhancing access to care services, promoting remote monitoring and communication, and facilitating the sharing of information and best practices among care providers. Lastly, it is important to ensure that older women and men are actively involved in decision-making processes regarding aging and care services. This can promote the development of policies and measures that are tailored to their specific needs and preferences, ultimately leading to more effective and inclusive care solutions. In conclusion, the Council's adoption of the conclusions titled \\"Equal opportunities for women and men: active and dignified aging\\" demonstrates a commitment to addressing the needs of older people, and particularly older women and men, in the context of care services and home care. By promoting equal opportunities, quality care services, and active participation, these conclusions can contribute to a more inclusive and supportive environment for older women and men as they age."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: So the little girl now walked on, her bare feet quite red and blue with the cold. She carried a small bundle of matches in her hand, and a good many more in her tattered dress. No one had bought any of them the live long day; no one had given her a single penny. Trembling with cold and hunger crept she on, the picture of sorrow: poor little child! The snow-flakes fell on her long, fair hair, which curled in such pretty ringlets over her shoulders; but she thought not of her own beauty, or of the cold. Lights were glimmering through every window, and the savor of roast goose reached her from several houses;it was New Year's eve, and it was of this that she thought. In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected beyond the other. She sat down, drawing her little feet close under her, but in vain, she could not warm them. She dared not go home, she had sold no matches, earned not a single penny, and perhaps her father would beat her,besides her home was almost as cold as the street,it was an attic; and although the larger of the many chinks in the roof were stopped up with straw and rags. The wind and snow often penetrated through. Her hands were nearly dead with cold; one little match from her bundle would warm them. Perhaps, if she dared light it, she drew one out, and struck it against the wall, bravo! It was a bright, warm flame, and she held her hands over it. It was quite an illumination for that poor little girl; no, I call it rather a magic taper, _ , so beautifully blazed the fire within! The child stretched out her feet to warm them also; alas, in an instant the flame had died away, the stove disappeared, the little girl sat cold and comfortless, with the burnt match in her hand.

Question: What profession was Heather in her college days? Movie plot title: She's the One Movie plot: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\".

Two siblings Jane and Matt, needed eyeglasses. Matt was nearsighted, while Jane was farsighted. they bought themselves two nice pairs of eyeglasses.  Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. A:","output":"A: The sibling who didn't need convex corrective lenses is Matt.  Step-by-step justification: 1. The paragraph mentions that Jane is farsighted and Matt is nearsighted. 2.

Trenton mayor, others arrested in corruption probe Federal agents arrested the mayor of New Jersey's capital city early Monday as part of an ongoing corruption investigation into bribery allegations related to a parking garage project that was concocted as part of an FBI sting operation. Trenton Mayor Tony Mack, his brother Ralphiel and convicted sex offender Joseph Giorgianni, a Mack supporter who owns a Trenton sandwich shop, were accused of conspiring to obstruct, delay and affect interstate commerce by extortion under color of official right. Federal prosecutors alleged Mack agreed to use his influence in connection with a proposed parking garage project in the city. The garage was made up -- a fake project created by investigators to try to capture Mack, who has financial problems and attracted legal scrutiny since he took office. Federal agents began investigating Mack and the others in September 2010. Mack had become mayor in July. The defendants received 54,000 and anticipated accepting another 65,000 from a cooperating witness who purported to be a developer, according to court documents that laid out the sting and the accusations of wrongdoing. The criminal complaint portrays Giorgianni as a boastful man who did most of the talking with two FBI informants -- one who was cooperating to get a better deal in his own criminal case, another who was paid. The sting was similar to the massive \\"Bid Rig\\" sting that resulted criminal charges against 46 people -- many of them local New Jersey officials -- in 2009. Then, bribes were attached to fictitious development projects. Prosecutors have had mixed success in winning convictions. Giorgianni complains at one point that Mack cannot take bribes because he's being watched so closely, the documents said. \\"It's sickening,\\" he told one of the informants, according to the court papers. \\"I like to make money for my friends,\\" he said, according to the papers, and went on to reference infamously corrupt political boss William M. Tweed. \\"I like to do it like the Boss Tweed way. You know Boss Tweed ran Tammany Hall?\\" He was also caught on tape telling one of the informants, \\"One thing about the Mack administration -- when I say that, it's me and Mack -- we're not greedy. We're corruptible. We want anybody to make a buck,\\" and \\"I'm there to buffer the thing where, you know, take the weight... going to jail's my business. It ain't his.\\" By contrast, when Mack was recorded, it was mostly just to say he'd meet someone or exchanging pleasantries. But in April, he was recorded at a meeting with Giorgianni and one of the informants saying, \\"I really appreciate what you guys have done for us. I appreciate your support and, like before, I support you and I'll keep on supporting you.\\" Authorities say, though, that Mack, whom Giorgianni referred to as \\"Napoleon\\" was involved in the scheme. One piece of evidence they offer is that Giorgianni referred to money by code -- calling it \\"Uncle Remus\\" -- when he spoke with Mack, and that Mack seemed to know what he was saying. The complaint also said that 2,500 in 100 bills with the serial numbers of those given to Giorgianni were found in a search of Ralphiel Mack's home in July. Tony Mack was taken to an FBI office in Hamilton for processing and was driven into a secure area of the federal courthouse in Trenton at around 11 a.m.. Mack's administration has been in turmoil from Day 1, staggering from one crisis to another. A housecleaning of staff at City Hall opened the door for Mack's own appointees, who quickly turned it into a revolving door. Under an agreement reached last year, the Democrat can hire department heads only from a pool of applicants the state offers or he risks losing 6 million in state aid. One of his early backers was Giorgianni. The businessman went to prison in the 1980s on charges of carnally abusing and debauching the morals of a 14-year-old girl in the back of his sandwich shop. The case gained notoriety because of weight-related health problems that got Giorgianni, a steakhouse owner who once claimed to tip the scale at over 500 pounds, released and led a prosecutor to charge he \\"ate his way out of jail.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The mayor of Trenton, New Jersey, along with his brother and another person, were arrested as part of an investigation into bribery related to a fake parking garage project created by the FBI.

In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Options: A A Frenchman just quarreled with the barber who did his hair badly in New York.

Namaste Tower is a 316 m tall skyscraper currently under construction in Mumbai, India. It will be a mixed use skyscraper with 63 floors that will house a 380-room W Hotel, office and retail space. It has been designed by Atkins, Dubai. The design resembles the Namaste gesture: two wings of the hotel are clasped together like hands greeting. Can we draw the following conclusion? Namaste Tower is more than 1100 feet tall.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Namaste Tower is more than 1100 feet tall. Namaste Tower is a 316-meter tall skyscraper under construction in Mumbai, India. To determine if the structure is more than 1100 feet tall, we need to convert meters to feet. We know that 1 meter is equivalent to 3.28084 feet. To convert 316 meters to feet: 316 meters * 3.28084 feet/meter ≈ 1036.71 feet As per the calculation above, Namaste Tower stands at approximately 1036.71 feet tall. Although this height is impressive, it is slightly below 1100 feet. Therefore, it would be more accurate to conclude that Namaste Tower is nearly 1100 feet tall, but not more than that mark. The unique design of the Namaste Tower, resembling the traditional Indian gesture of greeting or respect, highlights the fusion of cultural symbolism and modern architecture. Upon completion, the building will serve both luxury hospitality and commercial purposes, with a 380-room W Hotel, office and retail spaces spread across its 63 floors. The design and planning of the tower have been undertaken by international design consultancy Atkins, based in Dubai, ensuring cutting-edge technology and design principles are employed throughout the project. In summary, the Namaste Tower is an iconic architectural project in Mumbai, India, with a height of approximately 1036.71 feet. Despite the tower not achieving a height of more than 1100 feet, it remains an integral symbol of modern India and its blend of cultural heritage with contemporary architectural design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first clashes between the Armenians and Azeris took place in Baku in February 1905. Soon the conflict spilled over to other parts of the Caucasus, and on August 5, 1905, the first conflict between the Armenian and Azeri population of Shusha took place. In March 1918 ethnic and religious tensions grew and the Armenian-Azeri conflict in Baku began. Musavat and Committee of Union and Progress parties were accused of Pan-Turkism by Bolsheviks and their allies. Armenian and Muslim militias engaged in armed confrontations, which resulted in heavy casualties. Many Muslims were expelled from Baku or went underground. Meanwhile, the arrest of Gen. Talyshinski, the commander of the Azerbaijani division, and some of its officers—all of whom arrived in Baku on March 9—increased anti-Soviet feelings among the city's Azeri population. On 30 March the Soviets, based on the unfounded report that the Muslim crew of the ship Evelina was armed and ready to revolt against the Soviets, disarmed the crew which tried to resist. This led to three days fighting,resulting in the death of up to 12,000 Azeris. Answer this question: How many years did it take for the first clashes between the Armenians and the Azeris to escalate into open conflict?","output":"The first clashes between the Armenians and Azeris began in February 1905 in Baku.

Q:Article: Sitting on the peaceful coast of Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, watching the sun move quietly into the sea, you shouldn't forget that Charles Darwin (1809-1882) arrived here in 1835. He stayed on the islands for five weeks, observing various animals. This finally inspired   his famous work,On the Origin of Species. You can certainly follow Darwin's footsteps and enjoy a trip from four to seven days to the islands. The islands are certainly a paradise   for wildlife, as there are no natural killers on the islands and the number of boats and visitors is under government control. Though you cannot walk freely as Darwin did about 200 years ago, each day is as impressive as it could be. The most well-known animals of the Galapagos is the giant tortoise , which can be seen moving slowly around the highlands of Santa Cruz, the second largest island in the archipelago . Some of these creatures are so old that they might have been seen in their youth by Darwin himself. Despite strict control over activities and timing, your stay on the Galapagos will be remembered as a chain of incomparable pictures: diving with sea lions that swim and play within inches of you; feeling small sharks touch your feet as you swim; and, most magically, seeing a whale and her baby surface with a great breath of air. Travelling between the islands and observing the wildlife that so inspired Darwin, you will feel as though you are getting a special view of an untouched world. At night you will sleep on board the ship, leaving the wildlife in complete occupation of the islands, which are as undisturbed now as they have been since the beginning of time. Question: What do we know about Darwin's visit to the islands? Yes or no, is the answer \\"He studied different creatures on the islands.\\"?

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

The prankster in question, Blain Morrison, attempted to coax some insider information from Pulis about potentially taking defender Gareth McAuley on loan. The candid conversation between Pulis and the prankster came ahead of West Brom's Premier League fixture against Swansea City at the Hawthorns. Step 1: Set the scene Blain Morrison, better known online for his impressive impression skills, decided to put his talent to the test when he opted to pull an innocent but strategic prank on West Brom manager Tony Pulis. Pretending to be former footballer and manager Neil Lennon, Morrison implemented a faux conversation around the possibility of acquiring Gareth McAuley on a temporary loan basis. Step-2: Detail the conversation Unwittingly duped by Morrison's impeccable portrayal, Tony Pulis refused the false proposition, stating that Gareth McAuley would not be available for such a deal. Instead, Pulis kindly recommended Crystal Palace's Paddy McCarthy as an alternative option. Although nothing substantial materialized from the call, the end result is testament to both Pulis's professionalism and Morrison's knack for imitation. Step-3: Provide context around the match The lighthearted incident occurred in the lead-up to West Brom's midweek encounter with Swansea City at the Hawthorns. Eager to earn a strong result, Pulis and his players were solely focused on their preparation for the game and ensuring the team had the best chance to secure three valuable points.

Conclusion: Despite the harmless prank, Tony Pulis quickly redirected his attention back to the match. With West Brom focusing on maintaining a strong position in the Premier League standings, the unexpected phone call may have provided a moment's amusement, but Pulis's unwavering commitment to his team remained at the forefront."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. An eight-year-old boy whose parents launched a successful social media campaign to get him access to experimental new medicine is doing so well he didn't need dialysis Monday, and hopefully won't need it again on Wednesday. Josh Hardy from Fredericksburg, Virginia, who was battling cancer and an accompanying infection, is now part of a new clinical trial for the drug brincidofovir, which is being developed by Chimerix Inc. And since his first dose on March 12, his deadly adenovirus has all but disappeared from his system. He was able to leave St. Jude Children's Hospital in Tennessee on April 10, and continue treatment as an outpatient. Good news: Josh Hardy from Fredericksburg, Virginia, who was battling cancer and an accompanying infection, is ditching the dialysis after a few months on the drug brincidofovir, which is being developed by Chimerix Inc. Now he's ditched the dialysis - a big step that means Josh's kidney function is returning and the organs are clearing and filtering as they should. Since he's been out of the hospital, his health has improved in other ways too, his mom told Fredericksburg.com. Aimee Hardy said he no longer has tubes in his nose and can eat and drink on his own, with his favorite meal being Chick-fil-A. His family said they're now working on building up his strength with physical therapy that will get him walking and running. 'We practice walking,' Mrs Hardy told the news website. 'We trick him into doing leg lifts by kicking a ball.' The gravely ill little boy was given the experimental drug after his parents made their high-profile plea to the boss of Chimerix. Josh was fighting for his life in March after contracting the infection that caused internal bleeding and heart and kidney failure. But his family said the virus was barely detectable after just four doses of Brincidofovir. Feeling better: Josh, pictured before contracting the deadly virus, was discharged from hospital in April. New drug: Josh's family posted this picture of him getting his first dose of the experimental drug. Sick: Earlier this year, the then-7-year-old could barely speak and was vomiting blood, while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside. His mother Aimee, who campaigned the drug company, told ABC 11 earlier this year: 'We have gone from dire circumstances to discussing with our doctors what we need to do to get Josh discharged from the hospital. 'We are so grateful that the company was able to find a way for Josh to receive the medicine.' Josh was moved from ICU to a regular room at St Jude Children's Hospital, in Memphis, before he was later discharged. Earlier this year, the then-7-year-old could barely speak and was vomiting blood, while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside. Josh's body, weakened by chemotherapy after he had cancer for the fourth time, was struggling to fight of the adenovirus. The only available drugs were not working and Chimerix had refused to give the family access to the experimental medication Brincidofovir. Happier times: Josh was fighting for his life in March after contracting a virus that was causing internal bleeding and heart and kidney failure. But, after his family launched the #savejosh campaign, Chimerix relented. The company, in return, has been allowed to use data from Josh to help its FDA application, which could bring the drug on the market earlier. Chimerix chief Kenneth Moch announced on Tuesday, March 11, that his firm would begin a pilot trial for the drug immediately - with Josh as the programme's first patient. Moch had faced huge criticism for denying Josh Brincidofovir to fight off an infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant. Agreed: Chimerix chief executive Kevin Moch agreed to make the drug available after a campaign. In a statement, Moch said that after much careful consideration Chimerix would offer Josh the medicine. 'This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for everyone,' Moch said according to Fox News. 'Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. 'It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of Brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.' Josh's physical condition improved almost immediately, although at the time his mother said he appeared to have lost his motivation after months of ill health. She told CNN his once-positive attitude appeared to have gone and he appeared exhausted. 'I haven't seen him smile lately,' she said back then. Josh suffered severe kidney damage after being given other drugs to try to halt the virus. This saw his require dialysis three times a week and had doctors fearing he'd need it for the rest of his life - something that haunted Mrs Hardy. 'If he could have gotten the Brincidofovir earlier, it could have been avoided. That will always bother me,' she said earlier. Her wishes may have now come true. The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but has previously been administered to hundreds of other patients under a prior 'compassionate use' allowance. Previously Moch said that saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to many more patients, draining the company's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given FDA approval and help many more future patients. However, the company received 72 million in federal funding to develop Brincidofovir. Battler: Josh Hardy has survived four bouts of kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant. Before she was able to secure the drug for her son, Mrs Hardy said the situation was devastating, especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live. 'There's no good excuse for us,' she said. 'There's nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking. We're begging them to give it to us.' Josh's doctors also contacted Chimerix requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug. 'We have gone from dire circumstances. to discussing with our doctors what we need to do to get Josh discharged. from the hospital. We are so grateful that the company was able to find a way for Josh to receive the medicine' - Josh Hardy's mother Aimee. Josh was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007. Since then, he has battled the disease four times. He had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in November of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments. In January of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at St Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Following the successful surgery he developed adenovirus, an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems. 'Normally, Josh's immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,' Mrs Hardy wrote on her son's CaringBridge page. 'The challenge is his immune system can't be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.' Brincidofovir has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, Fox and Friends has reported.

Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira's origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato's lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan's historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, \\"Island of Timber. \\" The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.  After reading the above, is \\"Plato's Lost Atlantis\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What is the name of one of the islands that is part of a landmass that some think once fused the continents of Europe and America?\\"?

So it is only natural that most moms and dads will try just about anything, including spending a lot of money -to keep an attack at bay. Trouble is, more than half of parents are trying strategies that simply do not work and wasting hundreds of dollars in the process. According to Dr. Machael Cabana, a pediatrician at the prefix = st1 /UniversityofMichigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, who led the study, one of the most common mistakes was to buy mattress cover to protect against dust mites for a child whose asthma instead was made by plant pollen  . Many of those parents then neglected to do what would have helped a lot more; shut the windows to keep pollen out. Another was using a humidifier for a child who was allergic to dust mites; a humidifier tends to be a place where dust mites like to breed. With those allergies, a dehumidifier works better. Worst of all was the number of smokers with asthmatic children who didn't even try to quit or at least limit themselves to smoking outdoors rather than just moving to another room or the garage. Many smoking parents purchased expensive air filters that have what Cabana called \\" questionable utility. \\" Part of the problem, Dr. Caban and his colleagues believe, is that parents are bombarded by television ads that encourage them to buy products such as air and carpet fresheners, ionizers and other remedies that are often expensive but medically unnecessary. And doctors may not always take the time, or have the time, to explain to parents what will and won't work in their child's particular case. For example, allergies are usually a problem for older children with asthma, while kids 5 and younger more frequently have trouble with viral repiratory infections.

Here are possible answers to this question: - falling down - provide shelter - bud - produce fruit - back yard  I believe the correct choice is \\"provide shelter\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The character of Robinson Crusoe in Daniel Defoe's novel \\"Robinson Crusoe\\", after being shipwrecked, relied on a huge tree to provide shelter. This is a common theme in survival literature where the protagonist makes use of their environment for shelter, food, and other basic needs. Robinson Crusoe, alone on an uninhabited island, had to make use of any resources available to him to survive. This included utilising a huge tree as a form of shelter. In the book, Crusoe builds a structure, or a makeshift home, by the help of this tree. This not only safeguards him from the elements, but also provides a degree of safety against wild animals. The other options: - Falling down: It is unlikely that Crusoe wanted the tree to fall down as it served as his shelter. - Bud and produce fruit: While fruit from trees can serve as a source of nutrition, it wasn't the primary function of the huge tree for Crusoe. - Backyard: This doesn't make sense in the context as Crusoe was stranded in an uninhabited island, not a backyard.

Choices: (I) tired; (II) awake; (III) lethargic; Answer:","output":"In order to determine how Skylar would feel after taking a nap, let's analyze the possible outcomes step by step: Step 1: Understand the context Skylar was feeling tired and decided to take a nap to refresh themselves.  Step 2: Consider the possible choices (I) tired (II) awake (III) lethargic Step 3: Evaluate each choice based on the context (I) tired - If Skylar is still tired after the nap, it might mean that the nap was either not long enough or was not a restful sleep. (II) awake - If Skylar feels awake after the nap, it would mean that the nap was effective in helping them feel refreshed and rejuvenated. (III) lethargic - If Skylar feels lethargic after the nap, it might imply that the nap was too long, causing them to feel groggy and sluggish instead of refreshed. Step 4: Determine the most likely outcome Since Skylar took a nap with the intention to refresh themselves, it is reasonable to assume that they would try to nap for an appropriate amount of time to achieve this goal.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 'Friday Night Lights' Reunion Shuts Down Hopes for Reboot Correction appended, June 13, 2016 It may be hard to believe, but Friday Night Lights, the drama that made football fans of even the sports-averse, premiered a whole decade ago. The sleeper hit about a high school football team in the fictional small town of Dillon, Texas is still a treasured television artifact: it gave us timeless mantras like “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose” and the classic “Texas forever.” (Not to mention inspiring women everywhere with Connie Britton’s infinite wisdom and aspirational hair.) Unfortunately, though, we won’t get to see the show make a comeback. The cast reunited over the weekend — but not to film a reboot. Some cast members, including Britton, attended a reunion at the ATX Television Festival, while others, including Minka Kelly and Taylor Kitsch, attended a separate gathering in Illinois to race in the Chicago Spartan Super. Although actress Minka Kelly told Vanity Fair that they’re “like a little family,” it doesn’t sound like fans should get their hopes up for a sequel to the beloved show, which aired for five seasons before ending its run in 2011. “I’ll never play Riggins again,” said Taylor Kitsch, known for his role as the hunky, brooding football star. Kelly, who played peppy cheerleader Lyla Garrity, agreed: “I think some things are better left [with people] wanting more.” The actors also mused on where their characters would be now: Kitsch thinks Riggins would be hanging out on his land with a family, while Kelly said Garrity would probably have settled in Nashville. And despite the steamy romance the two shared on the show, both actors believe Riggins would have ended up with his other love interest, Adrianne Palicki’s Tyra Collette. (Kelly, for her part, waffled on that prediction.) Some things in Texas are forever, though: the Austin-based reunion included a throwback tailgate and pep rally held right on the Panthers’ field where the show was originally filmed. Check out some snaps of the cast below. Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly said that Kelly and Kitsch were at the ATX Television Festival in Atlanta. They were at a separate event in Chicago. Summary:","output":"The cast of the popular TV drama Friday Night Lights recently reunited, but not for the purpose of filming a reboot of the series. Some cast members attended a reunion at the ATX Television Festival, while others participated in the Chicago Spartan Super in Illinois.

Question: \\"Which is not a last name, Burke or Political?\\"  Context: \\"Richard Hurd believed that Burke's imitation was near-perfect and that this defeated his purpose: an ironist \\"should take care by a constant exaggeration to make the ridicule shine through the Imitation. Whereas this Vindication is everywhere enforc'd, not only in the language, and on the principles of L. Bol., but with so apparent, or rather so real an earnestness, that half his purpose is sacrificed to the other\\". A minority of scholars have taken the position that, in fact, Burke did write the Vindication in earnest, later disowning it only for political reasons.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The term 'Political' is not a last name, while 'Burke' is. By definition, a last name is a surname, or a family name that is handed down from generation to generation. There are a wide variety of last names across the globe, originating from various cultures and languages. In this context, 'Burke' refers to a last name. The text mentions a person with the name Burke. This is a widely recognized and common surname. It is used in many English-speaking countries and originated from a surname of Irish origin. On the other hand, 'Political' is not a surname but a term referring to issues, activities, and affairs that relate to the government or the public affairs of a country. It may be used to describe anything that involves the state, government, or public affairs. For example, 'Political reasons' in the context indicates motives or influences related to government, public governance, or policy considerations. Therefore, compared between 'Burke' and 'Political', 'Political' is not a last name. It is essential to differentiate between what terms are used as last names and those serving other functions in a sentence or a series of texts. Understanding the context helps make this distinction clear. In the text provided, Burke is used as a person's name, while 'Political' is used as an adjective describing reasons linked to public affairs or governance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Though Bowden threatens to turn Dussander in, the teenager reveals his fascination with Nazi activities during World War II and blackmails the war criminal into sharing stories about the death camps.When he spends more time with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend (Heather McComb), and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Bowden's school counselor Edward French (Ed Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both the old man and the young boy, and Dussander begins killing animals in his gas oven. Dussander also takes great pride in Bowden's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.One night, Dussander tries to kill a hobo who sees him in the uniform. When Dussander has a heart attack, he calls Bowden, who finishes the job, cleans up, and calls an ambulance for Dussander. At the hospital, Dussander is recognized by a death camp survivor sharing his room, and he is arrested to be extradited to Israel. Bowden graduates as his school's valedictorian and gives a speech about Icarus, saying, \\"All great achievements arose from dissatisfaction. It is the desire to do better, to dig deeper, that propels civilization to greatness.\\" The scene is juxtaposed in a montage with Dussander's home being searched and the hobo's corpse being found in the basement.Bowden is briefly questioned about his relationship with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew nothing of the old man's true identity.

Gary Sheffield signed with the Yankees to play in the postseason, and he said he won #39;t be distracted by a controversy stemming from his admission to unknowingly using a steroid two years.","output":"Gary Sheffield's signing with the New York Yankees and the surrounding controversy is an intriguing story, one that speaks to broader issues within modern professional sports. In this answer, I will first discuss who Gary Sheffield is, then I will discuss his signing with the Yankees and why it was significant, and finally I will analyze the controversy that arose regarding his admission to unknowingly using a steroid two years prior. Gary Sheffield is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) player who had an impressive career spanning from 1988 to 2009. He played for several teams during his MLB tenure, including the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Florida Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, and the New York Yankees. Over the course of his career, Sheffield was known for his prodigious batting skills, amassing a career total of 509 home runs, 1,676 runs batted in, and a batting average of .292. His performance saw him selected to the MLB All-Star game nine times and win the Silver Slugger award five times. Sheffield's career climaxed with a World Series win in 1997 with the Florida Marlins. In December 2003, Gary Sheffield signed a lucrative three-year, 39 million contract with the New York Yankees, widely regarded as one of the most storied franchises in MLB history. This move was significant for several reasons. Firstly, the Yankees have a record of pursuing high-profile players, and with Sheffield's impressive resume, he was an attractive target. Secondly, the Yankees were looking to improve their chances of success in the playoffs and potentially win their first World Series since 2000. Adding a player with Gary Sheffield's experience and hitting ability was seen as a move that would bolster the team's offense and improve their chances in the postseason. However, Sheffield's signing with the Yankees was soon overshadowed by controversy, stemming from his admission of unknowingly using a steroid two years prior. In the early 2000s, the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) had become a significant issue in professional sports, and baseball was no exception. A number of players were implicated in the \\"Steroid Era,\\" and Sheffield's admission put him squarely in the middle of the controversy. While he stressed that he had not knowingly used steroids and that his consumption had been accidental, many fans and critics questioned his integrity and wondered whether his career accomplishments had been tainted by drug use. At the time, Sheffield addressed the controversy by stating that he would not be distracted by it while playing for the Yankees in the postseason. To his credit, in the 2004 season, he demonstrated his focus on the field by hitting 36 home runs, driving in 121 runs, earning a Silver Slugger award, and receiving his eighth All-Star selection. Sheffield helped the Yankees reach the American League Championship Series (ALCS) where they faced the Boston Red Sox, though they eventually lost in a dramatic seven-game series. In conclusion, the story of Gary Sheffield signing with the New York Yankees and the surrounding controversy is illustrative of the challenges that athletes often face in their professional lives. Transfers and acquisitions of high-profile players, such as Sheffield's signing with the iconic Yankees, often raise the stakes and make the athletes a focal point for fan and media attention. Sheffield's admission to unknowingly using steroids further intensified the scrutiny on him, but as a seasoned professional athlete, he demonstrated resilience and commitment by maintaining his focus on the field. Nevertheless, the rise of PED use during the \\"Steroid Era\\" left an indelible mark on the perception of certain athletes and the game itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food.

Eventually Frank approaches Archie in a cafe after getting over his loss and they both decide to travel to Perth to enlist. Before leaving, Archie gives all the prize money he won at the race to Jack and tells him that he will not be coming home for he had decided to enlist. As Archie and Frank are penniless, they secretly hop on a freight train, then walk across the desert and stop for the night at a cattle station. Upon arriving in Perth, they arrange to stay with Frank's father, an Irish immigrant. Due to Frank's Irish heritage and general cynicism, he has little desire to fight for the British Empire.

Failing to ride a horse, Frank enlists in the infantry with three co-workers from the railway: Bill (Robert Grubb), Barney (Tim McKenzie), and Snowy (David Argue). Many of the motivations for enlistment are revealed: wartime ultra-nationalism, anti-German propaganda, a sense of adventure and the attraction of the uniform.

A group of care home staff have been sacked after allegedly mimicking elderly residents and trying on their clothes then posting the pictures on Facebook. Five workers at Bramble Hollow care home, in Hetton-le-Hole, Tyne and Wear, have been dismissed following the ‘appalling’ incidents. It is understood they posed for photographs while dressed in the elderly residents’ clothes before posting the pictures on the social networking site. Five workers were sacked from Bramble Hollow care home, in Hetton-le-Hole, Tyne and Wear. Residents and relatives at the purpose-built home for over 55s have told how they have been left shocked by the incident. A Bramble Hollow resident said: ‘I keep myself to myself, but I’ve heard things. I heard rumours of staff wearing old people’s clothes, I think in the home.’ A visitor to the home, who did not want to be named, said: ‘We heard that people had been sacked. Staff allegedly posted pictures of themselves wearing residents' clothes onto Facebook. ‘Apparently it was for messing round, which isn’t very nice for the people here.’ Housing 21, which runs Bramble Hollow, confirmed an investigation has been carried out into the allegations, which resulted in five members of staff being dismissed. Victoria Barclay, regional operations director for Housing 21, said: ‘A recent investigation led to the dismissal of five members of our care staff at Bramble Hollow. ‘Housing 21 has a strict social media policy in place to protect customers and staff and any breach of this policy is taken very seriously.’ Age UK Sunderland boss Alan Patchett has slammed the behaviour of the staff involved. He said: ‘I am shocked that this type of behaviour should go on in care premises in Sunderland. ‘It’s absolutely appalling that care workers should display such a lack of respect towards the residents in their care.’ Bramble Hollow was opened in 2011 and consists of 48 purpose built apartments - it also has on-site care and support services.","output":"1.

They took pictures of themselves dressed up like this and put them on a website called Facebook, where lots and lots of people could see them.  4.

Five of those workers have now lost their jobs because of what they did. The company in charge, called Housing 21, investigated what happened and then fired them.  6. One important lady at Housing 21, called Victoria Barclay, said that they have strict rules about using things like Facebook and anyone who breaks these rules will get in trouble. 7. A man named Alan Patchett, who looks after an old people's help group, said the workers' actions were very disrespectful to the residents.  8.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"The linguistic integrity of the given sentence can be assessed on several basis including its grammatical correctness, semantic clarity, and pragmatic coherence. Let's analyze each aspect in detail: 1. Grammatical correctness: The sentence adheres to the basic rules of English grammar. The subject \\"John\\" is followed by the verb \\"hurt,\\" which matches in tense and agreement, followed by an object \\"John\\" and a prepositional phrase providing more information about the situation. The possessive form \\"John's umbrella\\" correctly indicates the ownership of the umbrella. Therefore, the sentence can be considered grammatically accurate. 2. Semantic clarity: Semantics refers to the meaning carried by a sentence or a phrase. The given sentence conveys the action of one person (John) hurting another person, also named John, with an umbrella that belongs to the latter. While there is a clarity in meaning, the sentence creates confusion by using the same name for both the subject and object. This may lead to ambiguity for the readers due to the repetition of the proper noun “John”. In this case, the linguistic integrity could've been improved by either using different names for the characters involved or by adding further context to distinguish the two individuals better. 3. Pragmatic coherence: Pragmatics deals with the impact of context on the interpretation of a sentence. The given sentence provides some context by mentioning the reason for the action: \\"when John tried to open it.\\" However, the lack of a wider context or background information, such as the relationship between the two Johns or the reason why one John would react violently to the other John opening an umbrella, might prevent readers from understanding the situation fully. Adding more context to the sentence, or placing it within a larger narrative, could have greatly improved the sentence's linguistic integrity in terms of pragmatics. In conclusion, the linguistic integrity of the given sentence is partially upheld, as it demonstrates a grammatical correctness and a level of semantic clarity, but still leaves room for confusion and lack of context. To improve the linguistic integrity, one could work on differentiating the characters involved by changing the name for one of the Johns or adding more context to clarify the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese literature has alyeady attracted international attention, but experts say translation remains a barrier. \\"Many very good Chinese writers have been accepted globally for a long time already.\\"says Michel Hockx, professor of University of London. \\" It's mainly because there are many more opportunities for Chinese writers to visit other countries, to publish their work outside China and to interact with readerships abroad. At the same time, more and more people globally are learning Chinese and taking an interest in Chinese language and Chinese culture.\\" Hockx adds: \\"We need more good translators, especially foreign translators, who know good Chinese and can translate the work into their own languages in a way that foreign readers will appreciate and understand.\\" London's independent literary agent Toby Eady, who represents many Chinese writers, including Yu Dan, met Mo about 15 years ago in China. But Eady says:\\"I still think Mo Yan's writing--and, to an extent, all Chinese writing--are not truly understood by Western readers because a part of Chinese literature is lost in translation. The translator has done a good job in translating Mo's work, but the variety of Chinese vocabulary doesn't well translate into English.\\" University of Oxford lecturer in medern Chinese literature Margaret Hillenbrand says:\\"The obvious reason for the growing global presence of Chinese literature is the growing global presence of China itself.

You should only have to pass over the turf once to completely clear it of larger debris. While a leaf blower is effective for larger debris, it might not clear the grass of dust or spills.

In 1987, Seagal began work on his first film, Above the Law (titled Nico in Europe), with director Andrew Davis and reportedly as a favor to a former aikido student, the agent Michael Ovitz. Ovitz took Seagal to Warner Brothers to put on an aikido demonstration and the executives were impressed by him and offered him several scripts; Seagal turned them down but agreed to write what would become Above the Law. Following its success, Seagal's subsequent movies were Hard to Kill, Marked for Death, and Out for Justice, all box office hits, making him an action hero. Later, he achieved wider, mainstream success in 1992 with the release of Under Siege (1992). That film reunited Seagal with director Andrew Davis, and was a blockbuster in the U.S. and abroad, grossing 156.4 million worldwide.  Seagal hosted the April 20, 1991 episode of the late night variety show Saturday Night Live, which aired as the 18th episode of the 16th season. Cast member David Spade regarded Seagal as the show's worst host during Spade's time there. Spade and co-star Tim Meadows cite Seagal's humorlessness, his ill treatment of the show's cast and writers, and his refusal to do a \\"Hans and Franz\\" sketch because that skit's title characters stated that they could beat up Seagal. Seagal was never invited back to the show following that episode. Meadows commented, \\"He didn't realize that you can't tell somebody they're stupid on Wednesday and expect them to continue writing for you on Saturday.\\" The cast and crew's difficulties with Seagal were later echoed on-air by producer Lorne Michaels during guest host Nicolas Cage's monologue in the September 26, 1992 Season 18 premiere. When Cage worried that he would do so poorly that the audience would regard him as \\"the biggest jerk who's ever been on the show\\", Michaels replied, \\"No, no. That would be Steven Seagal.\\"  Seagal directed and starred in On Deadly Ground (1994), featuring Michael Caine, R. Lee Ermey and Billy Bob Thornton in minor supporting roles. The film emphasized environmental and spiritual themes, signaling a break with his previous persona as a genre-ready inner-city cop. On Deadly Ground was poorly received by critics, especially denouncing Seagal's long environmental speech in the film. Regardless, Seagal considers it one of the most important and relevant moments in his career. Seagal filmed a sequel to one of his most successful films, Under Siege, titled Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995), and cop drama The Glimmer Man (1996). In 1996, he had a role in the Kurt Russell film Executive Decision, portraying a special ops soldier who only appears in the film's first 45 minutes. In another environmentally conscious and commercially unsuccessful film, Fire Down Below (1997), he was an EPA agent fighting industrialists dumping toxic waste in the Kentucky hills.

Article: Manners nowadays in big cities like London are particularly non-existent. It's nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an elderly woman aside in the dash for the last remaining seat on the tube or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her. This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy  and that those who go out to work should take their turn in _ like anyone else. Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it's not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for older women, the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to ourselves \\" First come, first served\\", while a gray-haired woman, a mother with a young child or a cripple stands? Yet this is too often seen. Older people, tired and easy annoyed from a day's work, aren't angels, either--far from it. Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the weary queues push and shove each other to get on buses and tubes. One cannot commend  this, of course, but one does feel there is just a little more excuse. If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems necessary, not only that communication in transport should be improved, but also that communication between human beings should be kept smooth and polite. Shop assistant won't bother to assist, taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round corners, bus conductors pull the bell before their desperate passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, and so on. It seems to us that it's up to the young and strong to do their small part to stop such deterioration  .

News article: KABUL - The acting chief financial officer and other Pakistani employees of Kabul Bank have fled Afghanistan amid an investigation into the scope of the bank's reckless lending and allegations that its shareholders paid large bribes to many senior Afghan officials, according to Afghan officials and others familiar with the issue.      The executive, Rana Tayyab Tahir, and his colleagues in the finance department of Afghanistan's largest and most sophisticated bank fled to Pakistan on Jan. 14, a move some said was made out of fear for their lives and possible arrest in Afghanistan.      Afghan authorities have called several bank managers, including foreigners, in for questioning and detained some in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province in connection with illicit transfers of bank funds.      Sherkhan Farnood, a world-class poker player who founded Kabul Bank and served as its chairman until his ouster in September, is now under effective house arrest, along with former chief executive Khalil Fruzi. Both are barred from leaving Afghanistan.      But other shareholders who took out million-dollar loans, including Mahmoud Karzai, the brother of President Hamid Karzai, and Haseen Fahim, the brother of Vice President Mohammad Qasim Fahim, have been allowed to leave the country.      Tahir and his colleagues could not be reached for comment. Two bank insiders said that authorities appear to be making managers into scapegoats for the powerful shareholders who withdrew hundreds of millions from the bank for personal use.      Investigators with Afghanistan's Central Bank and the attorney general's office have begun the complicated process of unraveling the web of illicit loans to politically connected shareholders and allegations of bribery to members of Karzai's administration.      Fruzi doled out millions of dollars to cabinet members, lawmakers and other influential Afghans, according to former bank officials and investigators, as used bank money to finance Karzai's 2009 election campaign.      \\"Nearly everyone in the cabinet got money from the bank,\\" said a person familiar with the investigation.      Fruzi could not be reached for comment. Farnood, reached by telephone, said he was not allowed to comment.      Several people involved in the probe say they do not believe the attorney general's office will attempt to prosecute the powerful shareholders. The investigation, they said, had been stalled by a lack of technical capacity to understand the transactions and by political pressure from President Karzai's office.      Last year, the U.S. government pressed Afghans to accept an independent forensic audit of Kabul Bank by an international accounting firm, but Karzai's government resisted. This month, Afghan finance ministry officials told Western officials that they would move forward with the forensic audit, under their control, and have begun accepting bids. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      KABUL, Afghanistan — Fraud and mismanagement at Afghanistan’s largest bank have resulted in potential losses of as much as 900 million — three times previous estimates — heightening concerns that the bank could collapse and trigger a broad financial panic in Afghanistan, according to American, European and Afghan officials.                              The extent of these losses make it clear that keeping the bank afloat — something the government has said it is determined to do — would require large infusions of cash from an already strained budget.      Banking specialists, businessmen and government officials now fear that word of Kabul Bank’s troubles could prompt a run on solvent banks, destroying the country’s nascent banking system and shaking the confidence of Western donors already questioning the level of their commitment to Afghanistan.      The scandal has severe political and security implications. Investigators and Afghan businessmen believe that much of the money has gone into the pockets of a small group of privileged and politically connected Afghans, preventing earlier scrutiny of the bank’s dealings.      Photo      The spotlight on how political and economic interests in Afghanistan are intertwined threatens to further undermine President Hamid Karzai’s government. The bank is also the prime conduit for paying Afghan security forces, leaving the American military, which pays the majority of the salaries, looking for new banks to process the 1.5 billion payroll.      As Afghan regulators struggle to find out where the money went, many officials and international monitors concede that the missing millions may never be recovered, raising questions of how the losses could be replaced to keep the bank from failing.      Afghan officials and businessmen have said the money was invested in a real estate bubble that has since burst in Dubai, as well as in dubious projects and donations to politicians in Afghanistan. Millions of dollars have yet to be traced, and some of the money seems to have gone to front companies or individuals and then disappeared.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The Afghan Central Bank and American officials are conducting their own parallel investigations, but the problems are so serious that the International Monetary Fund has not yet renewed an assistance program to Afghanistan that expired in September, threatening an essential pillar of support to a government reliant on international largess as it battles a nine-year insurgency.      Many donor countries may have to delay aid to Afghanistan because of their own requirements that money go only to countries with I.M.F. programs in good standing, Western diplomats said.      Several officials described the bank as “too big to fail,” referring to its role in paying the salaries of hundreds of thousands of government employees.      While Afghan and American officials depict a crisis far worse than has been made public, State Department cables released by WikiLeaks show that Afghan and Western regulators were aware of many of the problems, but were most focused on the problem of terrorist financing, rather than the fraud scheme that was the main problem at Kabul Bank.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      A stream of complaints about the bank’s practices — many of them the problems that now threaten the bank’s survival — are dutifully recorded in the cables, but diplomats, at least in 2009 and early 2010, seemed not to have realized the profound effect they could have on the financial system as a whole.      Photo      Although other banks here have had questionable loan practices, so far it is only Kabul Bank — where what amounts to an enormous fraud scheme was conducted over a period of years — whose troubles are sending tremors through the Afghan business community and worrying Western donors.      Deloitte, a top United States accounting firm that had staffers in the Central Bank under a United States government contract over the last several years, either did not know or did not mention to American authorities that it had any inkling of serious irregularities at Kabul Bank. Deloitte was not responsible for auditing the bank’s books; a spokesman for Deloitte did not respond to requests for comment.      In an interview this weekend, Mahmoud Karzai, President Karzai’s brother and a prominent investor in the Kabul Bank, said that the new president of Kabul Bank, Masood Musa Ghazi, told him in the last several days that there were approximately 800 million in loans still outstanding. These are potentially unrecoverable. Mr. Karzai said Mr. Ghazi told him that of that 800 million, the bank’s new management has negotiated agreements for the repayment of about 300 million, but little has been repaid.      Mr. Ghazi, who was appointed after the Central Bank forced a change in the bank’s management last fall, did not respond to phone calls or e-mails seeking comment, nor did anyone at Afghanistan’s Central Bank.      Kabul Bank has extensive links to senior people in the Afghan government. In addition to Mahmoud Karzai, other shareholders included Haseen Fahim, the brother of the first vice president, and several associates of the family from the north of Afghanistan. Afghan officials said the bank poured millions into President Karzai’s election campaign.      It is the loans and personal grants made by the bank to powerful people, including government ministers, that could prove the most explosive, Western and Afghan officials said. “If people who are thought to be clean and who were held up as ‘good’ by Western countries suddenly are caught with their fingers in the till, it will cause questions from donors,” said a Western official in Kabul. “They will say, ‘Why are we here?’ ”      Mahmoud Karzai said that he believed the bank’s former chairman, Sherkhan Farnood, was responsible for the problems at the bank, saying that he often moved large amounts of money out of the bank on his own, with no oversight. Mr. Farnood could not be reached for comment on Sunday, and has declined to comment in the past. Mr. Karzai and Mr. Farnood were previously business partners, but had a falling-out over the operation of Kabul Bank.      While he was in charge, Mr. Farnood had total control over what loans were made and what money was moved out of Kabul Bank, Mr. Karzai said. He said he was told by the bank’s managers that Mr. Farnood took about 98 million out of Kabul Bank to finance the purchase and subsequent operations of Pamir Airways, a small passenger airline in Afghanistan.      Photo      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In a cable from Sept. 26, 2009, posted by WikiLeaks, American diplomats said that competitor airlines complained that “Kabul Bank is using its deposit base to subsidize Pamir Air without its depositors’ knowledge in an attempt to drive competitors out of business.”      Mr. Karzai said that Mr. Farnood had been given space at Kabul Bank, where he was supposed to be helping the new management find the bank’s missing money.      “I think the bank is working with him to figure out what happened to the money, because he knows whom he lent it to and he knows where it is,” Mr. Karzai said. A spokeswoman for the United States Treasury Department in Washington declined to comment on the American inquiry.      “The situation of Kabul Bank is extremely serious,” said a Western diplomat in Kabul. “What you can observe is that the loans were either to fictive operators who did not exist or they were for investments outside the country.”      “Some were loans or personal grants to people linked to one shareholder or another shareholder,” the diplomat said.      According to businessmen in Kabul, loans were made to people who were fronts for the real beneficiaries. “Sometimes they would bring a loan document to someone who was a gardener or a cleaner and just ask them to sign it, and they would pay him 500 Afghanis and the person could not read or write more than his name,” said a prominent businessman here with ties to the banking community.      “Then, when the new bank managers go to look for the money, they go to the gardener’s house and they look around and they see there is nothing worth 100, and they have no idea where the money went.”      Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Kabul, said that officials were working closely with the Afghan government, the I.M.F. and the World Bank. “Corrective action in response to any instance of abuse, poor banking practices or fraud is essential for public and international confidence in Afghan financial institutions and the development of Afghanistan’s financial sector,” she said.      In Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province , a Kabul bank branch has been shut down for a week because employees transferred 1.3 million to Mr. Farnood, who was removed last fall for mismanagement.      In Kabul, the Ministry of Finance is putting out bids for a new bank to pay the salaries of the security forces, which previously had been paid exclusively through Kabul Bank, according to Col. John Ferrari, the head of training programs for NATO’s training mission here. Military officials say that none of the 1.5 billion in payroll for the Afghan Army and the police has been reported missing. But concerns over the possibility that the bank could fail was one factor prompting the ministry to seek other banks to process payroll, Western officials said.      A WikiLeaks cable from last February suggested that payments were often delayed so the bank could make money on the overnight interest rates. In a Feb. 13, 2010, cable, Kabul Bank is described as “the least liquid bank operating in Afghanistan” and its difficulty in raising cash was so great that it took “more than two days to process withdrawals and has delayed paying government employee salaries by two weeks in order to place those funds in overnight accounts to collect interest.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The acting CFO and other Pakistani employees of Kabul Bank have fled Afghanistan amid an investigation into reckless lending practices and allegations of bribery to senior Afghan officials.

Process:  - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose bacteria is washed away before it can find an opening happens, how will it affect more oxygen enters the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned states that bacteria are washed away before they can find an opening. In this case, the focus is on bacteria and their direct or indirect effects on the oxygen intake process. To assess whether this hypothesis impacts the process, let's examine the steps in more detail: 1. Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose: Bacteria can be present in the air we breathe or on the surfaces of the mouth and nose. If bacteria are washed away before they can enter the respiratory system, it could potentially reduce the risk of respiratory infections. However, it does not directly affect the oxygen entering the body, as the oxygen uptake is primarily dependent on the air we breathe. 2. The oxygen travels into the lungs: The presence or absence of bacteria has minimal direct impact on oxygen transportation within the lungs. The bronchi and alveoli are responsible for transferring oxygen to the bloodstream, and their function is generally not affected by bacteria being washed away. 3. The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells): This process is not directly influenced by bacteria, as the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is a chemical reaction that depends on factors such as oxygen partial pressure and pH, among others. 4. The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart: Bacteria do not play a significant role in this step. The heart and circulatory system function independently of bacterial presence, unless there is a serious infection that impairs their function. 5. All cells receive the oxygen: Oxygen delivery to cells is facilitated by the circulatory system and is not directly influenced by bacteria. However, if bacteria cause an infection or inflammation, it may indirectly affect oxygen delivery to certain tissues due to changes in local blood flow and oxygen demand. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis you proposed does not have a direct effect on the process of oxygen intake and distribution in the human body. The washing away of bacteria primarily prevents infections and inflammation but does not directly influence oxygen uptake and delivery. However, in cases where bacterial infections do occur and impair respiratory or circulatory function, then the removal of bacteria could indirectly affect the oxygen intake process by maintaining a healthier respiratory system and preventing inflammation or infections that may impact oxygen delivery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\"  part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor  has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion.  - Sir George Ivan Morrison, OBE (born 31 August 1945), known as Van Morrison, is a Northern Irish singer and songwriter with a reputation for being at once stubborn, idiosyncratic, and sublime. His studio albums \\"Astral Weeks\\" and \\"Moondance\\", and the live album \\"It's Too Late to Stop Now\\", are acclaimed as among the greatest recorded. In 2016, he was knighted for his musical achievements and his services to tourism and charitable causes in Northern Ireland.  - John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubsrefining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, \\"Inside Wants Out\\". His following two full-length albums\\"Room for Squares\\" (2001) and \\"Heavier Things\\" (2003)did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\".  - The Library of Congress (\\"LOC\\") is the research library that officially serves the United States Congress and is the \\"de facto\\" national library of the United States. It is the oldest federal cultural institution in the United States. The Library is housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.; it also maintains the Packard Campus in Culpeper, Virginia, which houses the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center.  - \\"Maybellene\\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement. The lyrics describe a man driving a V8 Ford chasing his unfaithful girlfriend in her Cadillac Coupe DeVille.  - \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is a 1965 song by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\".  - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\". The band was ranked 57th by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine in its \\"The Greatest Artists of all Time\\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.  - RatDog ( sometimes known as The Ratdog Revue , Bob Weir & RatDog or Ratdog ) was an American rock band .

She was born in a small town in northern Georgia before women could vote and when Jim Crow laws mandated racial segregation. Her life has spanned nearly a century of progress: The 19th Amendment extended suffrage to women, the Civil Rights movement led to the dismantling of segregation laws, and the Voting Rights Act outlawed overt racial discrimination in elections. Mrs. Cooper has always honored this past by voting. In 70 years, she has missed only one election, in 1960, because a move made her miss the registration deadline. Despite living through an era when African-Americans were routinely turned away from the ballot box -- and worse -- Mrs. Cooper said she \\"never had any problems\\" exercising her rights.

Paragraph: When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.  Question: \\"What was the name of the school where Karl Rove informed President Bush that an aircraft had hit the World Trade Centre?\\" Answer: \\"The cia\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Possible answers: (i) no.

Legislative efforts reflect a push to limit rights, workplace protections Persistent congressional efforts to cut back workplace protections for federal employees advanced when the House voted to dilute due process rights for Department of Veterans Affairs employees. Joe Davidson writes the Federal Diary, a column about federal government and workplace issues that celebrated its 80th birthday in November 2012. Davidson previously was an assistant city editor at The Washington Post and a Washington and foreign correspondent with The Wall Street Journal, where he covered federal agencies and political campaigns. Wednesday’s debate was similar to one last year when Congress approved a law that included an even harsher attack on due process for VA Senior Executive Service members. That effort and this one also are part of a growing push on Capitol Hill to limit the rights, pay and workplace protections for feds across the government. But there was a notable difference between the votes on VA measures last year and this week. Democrats, including those in the White House, now are standing up for feds. Last year, they, including President Obama, acted like workplace rights for VA senior executives were expendable. Republicans were consistent. They had no trouble stepping on employee due process either year. A word about due process for public employees — without it, political leaders would be free to stack the public workforce with political hacks loyal to a party instead of the government. Workplace protections protect not just the workers but the nonpartisan Civil Service system. The current bill, approved in a 256-to-170 vote generally along party lines, drew a White House veto threat. In addition to undercutting appeal rights for VA staffers facing termination or demotion, a less controversial portion of the legislation would make it easier to fire new workers by extending their probationary period from one year to 18 months. That was not mentioned in the veto threat. Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.), sponsor of the legislation, cast it as a measure to empower the department secretary “by allowing him or her to remove or demote any employee for poor performance or misconduct.” He said “the presence of poor performers and misconduct ranging from unethical practices to outright criminal behavior can spread like a cancer through a workforce.” Miller, chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, has been a leading force in exposing the scandal over the coverup of long wait times for patients at VA hospitals and championing needed department reforms. But what he views as a needed reform of VA personnel practices would severely undermine workplace protections for those workers. In a statement the day before the vote, the White House said the legislation would create “a disparity in the treatment of one group of career civil servants. The centerpiece of the bill is a provision that allows a VA employee to be removed from Federal service or demoted without the opportunity to appeal that decision to the full Merit Systems Protection Board” (MSPB), as most other federal workers can. Miller, however, repeatedly noted during debate on the bill that Obama and Democrats did not oppose a similar measure last year aimed only at VA senior executives. That point was not lost on Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association. “We are amazed that this bill, which mirrors last year’s Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act, is only now causing alarm within the administration,” Bonosaro said. “In fact, the 2014 act is a more draconian version of HR 1994 [the number of the bill approved Wednesday], yet the administration had no issue then with whether the new legal removal authority and process affected the due process rights of career senior executives, who are not in any bargaining unit and therefore are not represented by unions.” That also applies to the many congressional Democrats who supported last year’s measure. That support was used against them Wednesday. “In hindsight, we should have given that SES provision closer scrutiny,” said Rep. Mark Takano (Calif.), the Democrat’s floor manager for the bill debated Wednesday. “We might have reacted a bit too hastily to the Phoenix scandal. We were all, I think, unified in our outrage. However, that SES provision is now working its way through the court system and is very well possibly going to be overturned.” The SES measure was part of a larger VA reform package and that made a vote against it more difficult. Nonetheless, Democrats voiced little opposition to the senior executive provision. That provision actually was harsher for senior executives, allowing them an MSPB administrative judge appeal process of only 21 days, less than half the 45 days allowed VA staffers under the legislation just approved by the House. In neither case could the presidentially appointed MSPB members hear appeals from VA employees, a right available to other federal staffers. The current bill now goes to the Senate, where the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) hopes to defeat it. “It is a bad piece of legislation that harms every veteran in this country,” said AFGE President J. David Cox Sr. “I believe that we will win in the Senate because I believe more reasonable people will prevail.” If some of those reasonable people in the Senate, the House and the White House had fought harder last year to protect the due process rights of federal senior executives, they might not have such a tough fight now.

But a new study out of MIT and published in Nature shows those memories may still be somewhere in the brain and, what's more, could be recoverable. That's because, contrary to earlier scientific thought, the problem in Alzheimer's patients appears to be memory recovery, not memory storage. \\"Even if a memory seems to be gone, it is still there,\\" Nobel Prize-winning scientist Susumu Tonegawa tells the Post. \\"It’s a matter of how to retrieve it.\\" A Harvard neurology professor tells the Boston Herald the research conducted by Tonegawa's team \\"shattered a 20-year paradigm of how we’re thinking about the disease.\\" In the study, mice genetically altered to have Alzheimer's-like symptoms didn't seem to remember an earlier electric shock and fear further shocks. That changed when researchers stimulated brain cells associated with short-term memory in the mice. And while it opens the possibility of one day helping Alzheimer's patients recover their lost memories, it's not a process that is repeatable in humans and further research is needed. \\"We’re still many years away from knowing if it would be possible to restore lost memories in people,\\" one expert tells the Guardian. (Scientists believe they've found a link between Alzheimer's and herpes.) Expand this summary.","output":"Alzheimer's disease is a condition where people have trouble remembering things. It's like when you forget where you put your toy, but it happens a lot more often for people with Alzheimer's. For a long time, scientists thought that when people with Alzheimer's forgot something, that memory was gone forever. This made everyone very sad. Recently, some smart people at a place called MIT did a study with mice, which are tiny furry animals. They found out that the memories in the mice with Alzheimer's weren't really gone, they were just hiding! It was like the mice had put their memories in a secret hiding spot and couldn't find them again. To help the mice find their memories, the scientists used a special tool to give the memory part of their brains a little boost. This helped the mice remember things they had forgotten, just like magic! This is very exciting news because it means that maybe one day, we could help people with Alzheimer's find their hidden memories too. But the scientists say we still need to learn more and it might take a long time before we can help people the same way we helped the mice. So, it's important for us to keep being patient and supportive of those who have Alzheimer's and the scientists who are trying to help them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In my mind it HAD to be because I was fat . It just had to . The very next day I told myself I was going to lose weight . A switch had flipped . What may happen if she loses weight ?","output":"If she loses weight, several physical, emotional, and social changes may occur in her life. It's essential, however, to remember that weight loss should be pursued through healthy means and for the right reasons, such as improving one's overall well-being or addressing specific health concerns, rather than simply due to societal pressures or beauty standards. 1. Physical health improvements: Shedding excess weight can lead to several physical health benefits, as excessive weight can be connected to a variety of health issues. She may experience improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control, reducing her risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, a healthier weight can also lead to better sleep patterns, reduced joint pain, and improved mobility. 2. Mental and emotional well-being: Losing weight can have a significant impact on her mental and emotional well-being. It may boost her self-confidence and self-esteem, as she achieves her goals and feels more comfortable in her body. This can, in turn, positively affect her relationships, social interactions, and overall outlook on life. Furthermore, engaging in regular exercise and eating a balanced diet can contribute to improved mood and decreased anxiety or stress levels. 3. Increased energy levels: As she loses weight, she may notice an increase in her energy levels and overall stamina. Excess weight places stress on the body, causing it to work harder for everyday tasks. Once her body has less weight to move, she is likely to feel more energetic and find it easier to stay active throughout the day. 4. Better quality of life: Weight loss can lead to a better quality of life by enabling her to take part in a wider range of activities, both physically and socially. She may find that she no longer feels restricted by her weight when engaging in activities she enjoys or exploring new hobbies. This can lead to more enjoyable experiences and personal growth. 5. Social changes: As her self-confidence and energy levels rise, she may feel more inclined to engage with others and build new relationships or friendships. However, it's important that her self-worth is not based solely on her physical appearance but rather on who she is as a person. While losing weight can positively impact her life, it's crucial for her to develop a healthy relationship with her body and embrace the fact that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. 6. Potential challenges: It's important to note that weight loss can also present some challenges. She may face a potential loss of social support if her friends or family members feel threatened by her new lifestyle, or there may be moments during her weight loss journey where she experiences plateaus or setbacks. Nevertheless, overcoming these obstacles and persevering with a combination of healthy diet, exercise, and self-care will ultimately lead to long-lasting, sustainable improvements in her overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Tanks This is Awesome\\" Answer:","output":"Given the limited information provided in the review \\"Tanks This is Awesome,\\" it is difficult to provide a definitive ★-rating without having more context about the product, service, or experience in question. However, based on the positive language used in the review, it seems likely that the reviewer had a favorable experience, which might warrant a higher ★-rating. If we consider the prominent words and tone of the review, we can deduce certain factors that could help in deducing the rating: 1. \\"Tanks\\" - This could be a typo or an intentional play on words, potentially indicating a casual, conversational tone in the review. If it's an intentional pun related to a product or service involving tanks, then it might show enthusiasm for the product. 2. \\"This is Awesome\\" - The use of the word \\"Awesome\\" indicates a sense of excitement or satisfaction with the experience, which might suggest a very positive rating. Taking these factors into account, as well as the overall positive tone of the review, one could reasonably assume that the reviewer might assign a rating of ★★★★ or even ★★★★★ to their experience.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: In my early 20s, I was a one-on-one aide for a couple of teenagers with cerebral palsy. With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules. When did the author work as an aide to someone with spastic quadriplegia?

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: How are Dalit Buddhism and neo-Buddism related? Context: A number of modern movements or tendencies in Buddhism emerged during the second half of the 20th Century, including the Dalit Buddhist movement (also sometimes called 'neo-Buddhism'), Engaged Buddhism, and the further development of various Western Buddhist traditions. The answer to this question is:","output":"Dalit Buddhism and neo-Buddhism are related as they both represent modern movements or tendencies within Buddhism that emerged during the second half of the 20th century. These movements sought to address contemporary issues and adapt Buddhist teachings to the present context while maintaining a strong connection to the core principles of Buddhism. Specifically, Dalit Buddhism can be considered a part or a manifestation of the broader category of neo-Buddhism. Dalit Buddhism, also known as Ambedkarite Buddhism, is a Buddhist movement initiated by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in India. Dr. Ambedkar, a Dalit himself (a member of the most oppressed caste in India), converted to Buddhism to escape the caste-based discrimination perpetuated by Hinduism. The Dalit Buddhist movement seeks to eradicate the caste system, promote social justice, and encourage the upliftment of the Dalit community through the application of Buddhist teachings. It is a socio-political and religious movement that has played a crucial role in developing a sense of identity and empowerment among the marginalized and oppressed Dalits.  Neo-Buddhism, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses various modern Buddhist movements and tendencies, including Dalit Buddhism. It represents the new ways in which people practice and interpret Buddhism in the contemporary world and often incorporate elements of modernity, social responsibility, scientific perspectives, and environmental concerns. Engaged Buddhism, which emphasizes social activism based on Buddhist principles, is another example of a neo-Buddhist movement. Moreover, the Western Buddhist traditions' further development, which is characterized by adaptation to western cultural context, can also be considered a part of the neo-Buddhist tendencies. In summary, Dalit Buddhism and neo-Buddhism are related as Dalit Buddhism is a specific movement that falls under the broader umbrella of neo-Buddhism. Both of these movements highlight the ongoing evolution and adaptation of Buddhism to address contemporary challenges, social issues, and the needs of diverse communities."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Sometimes they are afraid to try something to help because it is dangerous to work on the brain. The doctors might make the person worse if he operates on the brain. Dr. Robert White, a famous professor and doctor, thinks he knows a way to help. He thinks doctors should make the brain very cold. If it is very cold, the brain can live without blood for 30 minutes. This gives the doctor a longer time to do something for the brain. Dr. White tried his idea on 13 monkeys. First he taught them to do different jobs, and then he operated on them. He made the monkeys' blood go through a machine. The machine cooled the blood. Then the machine sent the blood back to the monkeys' brains. When the brain's temperature was 10degC, Dr. White stopped the blood to the brain. After 30 minutes he turned the blood back on. He warmed the blood again.

Time lapse: This refers to a photography and videography technique that records and displays a series of frames taken over a longer period of time. This allows for the viewer to perceive events occurring at a slower pace more quickly, making it an effective way of visualizing gradual changes in a scene. 2. Clouds: Clouds represent a crucial element of the scene, as they depict the sky's natural formations made up of tiny water droplets and ice crystals. Clouds often lend a sense of depth and visual interest to a landscape and shape the viewer's perception of the surrounding environment. 3. Moving: The term \\"moving\\" implies motion and dynamism, conveying the idea that the clouds are changing their position steadily in the sky, traversing the mountain range as they progress. 4. Mountain range: The mountain range serves as an integral part of the scene, forming the primary landscape element that the clouds traverse. These natural landforms create distinctive patterns against the sky, profoundly impacting the visual appeal of the scene. 5.

Does the sentence \\"The best-selling drug ever, Lipitor, averaged 13 billion annually and netted 141 billion total over its lifetime before Pfizer's patent expired in November 2011.\\" answer the question \\"What was the bestselling drug in history?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"The best-selling drug ever, Lipitor, averaged 13 billion annually and netted 141 billion total over its lifetime before Pfizer's patent expired in November 2011.\\" answers the question \\"What was the bestselling drug in history?\\" by identifying Lipitor as the best-selling drug in history. To provide more detail and context to this answer, Lipitor, known generically as atorvastatin, is a cholesterol-lowering drug that belongs to the class of drugs called statins. Developed by Pfizer, it was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996. The primary purpose of Lipitor is to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or \\"bad\\" cholesterol levels in the blood, which aids in preventing heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. Atorvastatin, the active ingredient in Lipitor, works by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which is essential for the body's formation of cholesterol in the liver. By limiting the production of cholesterol, Lipitor helps to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in patients with high cholesterol levels or other risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, or hypertension. Lipitor's popularity and sales success can be attributed to several factors. First, the prevalence of high cholesterol and other heart disease risk factors leads to a significant demand for cholesterol-lowering medications. Second, Lipitor is considered highly effective and proven to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in numerous clinical trials. Lastly, aggressive marketing and promotional strategies employed by Pfizer contributed to the widespread awareness and popularity of the drug among both medical professionals and the general public. During its peak sales years in the early 2000s, Lipitor became the most prescribed drug in the United States. As mentioned in the given sentence, it generated an average of 13 billion annually, amounting to 141 billion in total sales over its lifetime before Pfizer's patent on the drug expired in November 2011. The expiration of the patent led to the introduction of generic versions of atorvastatin, resulting in a significant reduction in sales for the Lipitor brand. In conclusion, the mentioned sentence effectively answers the question about the best-selling drug in history. Lipitor held the title as it garnered a total of 141 billion in sales before the expiration of its patent. This massive sales figure is a testament to its widespread use and the immense need for effective cholesterol-lowering medications in combating heart disease and other related conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Given the following context:  Lennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\\" Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \\"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple, much to her fury.Ono began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \\"avant-garde bullshit\\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they \\"made love at dawn\\". When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \\"Oh, hi.\\" Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.Two years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War.

Should I validate this answer? OPT: * No * Yes The answer is:","output":"No, the suggested answer does not provide a clear and direct explanation of what grits are made from. Instead, it compares grits to other maize-based porridges. An appropriate and detailed answer would be as follows: Grits are a type of food made from coarsely ground corn, specifically from a type of corn called dent corn. They are native to the Southern United States, where they are commonly consumed as a breakfast dish or side dish. The process of making grits involves cleaning, hulling, and grinding the corn kernels, often resulting in different sizes of grits particles. Once ground, the grits can be then cooked in water, milk, or broth until they reach a creamy consistency. While grits are similar to other corn-based dishes like polenta and farina, the key difference is in the type of corn used and the grinding process. Polenta is made from flint corn, which has a harder outer shell, while grits are made from dent corn, which has a softer kernel. Farina is a finer-textured porridge made from wheat, which is unrelated to corn. So, while there are resemblances between these dishes, each has its own unique characteristics and preparation methods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here's a detailed and long negative review: \\"Title: Poor Food Quality and Disappointing Service Last Saturday, my friends and I decided to visit **Restaurant XYZ** after hearing mixed reviews. We thought of giving it a chance, considering that they have an attractive location and a seemingly extensive menu, catering to diverse preferences. Unfortunately, from the moment we stepped in, we were faced with a series of disappointments. To begin with, the ambiance did not meet our expectations. The lighting was far too dim, making it difficult to read the menu and engage in conversation. The furniture seemed dated and worn, with one chair even wobbling to the point that we had to stack napkins under its legs to stabilize it. Furthermore, the music was not only too loud but also unsuitable for the setting – it clashed with the upscale image the restaurant tried to project on its website. Moving on to the service, it was slow and unattentive. We were seated at our table for a good 15 minutes before anybody approached us to take our drink orders. Our waiter constantly disappeared, leaving us without water refills and forcing us to flag down other staff for help. This was not only frustrating, but it also prolonged our meal far beyond what was reasonable. The final straw was the food itself. While the menu seemingly boasted an impressive range of dishes, the actual quality and execution of the meals left much to be desired. My friend's steak was nearly inedible, cooked to a tough and chewy texture despite ordering it medium-rare. My pasta dish was swimming in a watery sauce that diluted any flavors that might have been present. The side dishes, such as the salad and bread, were equally lackluster, with wilted greens and stale bread. One of the desserts, a tiramisu, was one of the few redeeming aspects of our meal, as it had a pleasant flavor balance of coffee and mascarpone. Unfortunately, this minor positive experience was overshadowed by lingering disappointment from the rest of the meal. In conclusion, our experience at **Restaurant XYZ** was far from satisfactory. The poorly designed ambiance, unattentive service, and subpar food quality all contributed to an underwhelming and frustrating visit to this establishment. It's a shame because the restaurant seems to have potential, but it desperately needs improvements in several areas before we would consider returning. Based on our experience, I cannot recommend **Restaurant XYZ** to anyone looking for a quality dining experience.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write highlights for this article: California Gov. Jerry Brown will seek an immediate stay of what he called an \\"unprecedented\\" federal court order to release almost 10,000 inmates to relieve prison overcrowding by the end of the year, he said Thursday. A three-judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity by December 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if California does not report on its progress every two weeks, Thursday's ruling said. California has the nation's largest prison system and says it has been reducing overcrowding. The case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars. When plaintiffs filed motions to convene the three-judge court panel in November 2006, California's prisons were at 202% of design capacity. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a three-judge federal panel's determination that California's medical and mental health care for inmates falls below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirements is by reducing prison crowding. The Supreme Court in 2011 found that California's shortcomings in prison medical and mental health care resulted in \\"needless suffering and death\\" and recognized the federal court's prison reduction order was \\"of unprecedented sweep and extent,\\" Thursday's ruling said. The high court affirmed that order in full in 2011. On Thursday, the three U.S. District Court judges expressed impatience with California officials, the defendants in the case. \\"The history of this litigation is of defendants' repeated failure to take the necessary steps to remedy the constitutional violations in its prison system,\\" the order said. \\"It is defendants' unwillingness to comply with this Court's orders that requires us to order additional relief today.\\" The three-judge panel added that the plaintiffs' request for a court order to show why California shouldn't be held in contempt \\"has considerable merit.\\" \\"Our first priority, however, is to eliminate the deprivation of constitutional liberties in the California prison system,\\" the three judges said in their ruling. \\"We will therefore DEFER ruling on plaintiffs' motion, and defer instituting any contempt proceedings related to defendants' prior acts until after we are able to determine whether defendants will comply with this order.\\" Court documents also show that \\"DEFER\\" was not only all capitalized but also printed in bold face.","output":"The governor of California, Jerry Brown, wants to stop a court order that says almost 10,000 prisoners must be released to fix the problem of crowded prisons. The judges want California to have less prisoners in their prisons by the end of the year. California has the biggest prison system in the United States. In 2011, the Supreme Court said that not having good medical care and mental health care for prisoners is bad, and we need to have less crowded prisons to fix this problem. The judges are not happy with the way California officials are handling this issue. They want to make sure that the rights of prisoners are protected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will Sasha want to do next?\\", is \\"Talk to Austin about it\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Yes, \\"Talk to Austin about it\\" is indeed a valid answer. It is important for therapists to communicate effectively with their patients. Creating a treatment plan is just the initial step in the therapeutic process. The plan outlines the procedures, goals, and objectives that a therapist wants a patient to achieve. However, this plan is just a proposal until the patient or in this case Austin, is introduced to it. After devising a treatment plan, the following step would logically be to discuss it with Austin. This conversation holds great importance for various reasons: 1. Informed Consent: It is a ethical requirement in therapy to ensure that the client, Austin here, is fully informed about the treatment process and interventions planned to be used. Austin needs to know what to expect, how the therapy might help him, potential risks, duration, cost, and other alternatives available. After getting a complete picture, Austin can make a well-informed decision whether to proceed with the treatment or not. 2. Collaborative Treatment Planning: The role of patients in their treatment planning is fundamental. Therapy outcome often relies on how effectively the client can play their role and follow the treatment procedures. In being involved in the process, Austin can provide valuable insights about his personal experiences, preferences, and priorities. This encourages active participation from Austin's side and increases his commitment to the therapy. 3. Rapport Building: Effective communication is a key aspect of therapy and goes a long way in establishing a firm base for therapy. By discussing and involving Austin in the treatment planning process, Sasha is also building rapport and trust with him. Openness, mutual respect, and good rapport are crucial elements for therapeutic alliance. 4. Feedback and Redrafting: Therapy is not a static process and requires regular feedback and modification of the treatment plan. Austin’s feedback about what’s working or not working is vital for the therapy process. Accordingly, Sasha can adjust the treatment strategies to optimally meet Austin's needs and requirements. So, after devising a treatment plan for Austin's attitude, Sasha needs to talk to Austin about it. This step is not just a courtesy or formality, but a crucial aspect of the therapy process. It bridges the gap between therapy planning and implementation, making sure that Austin is on-board with the plan, is well-informed, and ready to collaborate for his treatment. Therefore, talking to Austin about the treatment plan is a valid and essential step Sasha would want to undertake next."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Coetzee is deserving of his Nobel Prize. I started to read Elizabeth Costello and couldn't even finish it because I was so bored. There's no real story to this book. I'm not sure why its classified as a work of fiction. Its not fiction, its a mish-mash of J.M. Coetzee's essays and ideas, collected under the guise of a \\"story\\".

I really tried to slog through it all the way to the end (its a slim volume), but I couldn't. Mr. Coetzee is no slouch and he's no dummy ...

Excess weight can make the weak areas in your abdomen carry more weight than they should. This increased pressure on weak abdominal points can increase your likelihood of having a hernia. Make sure to choose exercises that don't increase the stress on your abdominal wall. Good moderate exercises to try include walking, jogging, swimming and bicycling. Fiber helps move your bowels and empty your intestine. High-fiber diets also loosen your stool which will reduce straining when you go to the bathroom. Eat lots of fiber-rich foods like wheat bread, fruits and vegetables. You should also drink lots of water throughout the day to keep your bowels moving.

This can lead to constipation which can aggravate your abdomen. Avoid or be careful when lifting heavy objects. You can start lifting objects over 10 pounds about 6 weeks after surgery. To properly lift, bend at the knees to lower yourself. Grasp the object you're lifting close to your body and lift up, using your knees, not your waist. This helps reduce the weight and stress on the abdomen from lifting and bending. You may also want to wear a supportive garment around your waist.

Pinal County deputies arrested a San Tan Valley couple after their 2-year-old boy was found abandoned outside his residence in the 700 block of E. Payton Street. The parents, Brent Daley, 27, and Brianne Daley, 25 were arrested for child endangerment and child neglect after they left the child home alone for up to 90 minutes.      Both parents admitted they had left the child home alone to go play the Pokémon Smartphone game in nearby neighborhoods. Sheriff Paul Babeu said, “Our agency and many other law enforcement agencies have been warning people about personal safety while playing this interactive Smartphone game, but we never would have imagined that parents would abandon a child to play Pokémon Go. This goes beyond comprehension.” He went on to say, “The deputies found the child locked out of his home in 96 degree weather with no water while his parents were gone interacting with their Smartphone game.”      Details:      On July 28, at 10:30 p.m., a neighbor called the Pinal County 9-1-1 Communications Center reporting that she found a 2-year-old boy outside her neighbor’s house. She said that nobody was home and the child appeared to have been abandoned. Deputies arrived and found the child screaming and crying attempting to get into the residence. The child was barefoot with only a diaper and a T-shirt on. The child was red faced, sweaty, and dirty.      Deputies found the house unlocked and searched inside for any adults. They found three dogs inside, but no people inside. They confirmed by family pictures that the child lived at the residence.      Deputies found a phone number for someone they believed was the boy’s dad, Brent Daley. When they called and told him his child was found abandoned, he replied, “Whatever”, and hung up on the deputies.      While deputies had been on the scene for almost an hour, the couple showed up at the house. They confirmed that they were the boy’s parents and said they left the boy sleeping while they went out to get gas in their car. The couple was arrested for child neglect and endangerment.      Sheriff Babeu described the couple’s statements after they were arrested, saying, “The couple admitted they were away from the residence for up to 90 minutes playing the Pokémon Go Smartphone game. They said they were driving around San Tan Valley, stopping at parks and other places to interact with the game.”      The couple was booked and held in custody at the PCSO Jail awaiting to see a judge for the felony charges. The state Department of Child Services took custody of the child.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Are the French starting to realize that the US makes great wine? Araujo Estate Wines, in Calistoga, Calif., is a fabulous cult winery that produces about 2,000 cases of cabernet sauvignon annually. In July it was announced that it had been sold to the family of French businessman Francois Pinault through their Artemis Group holding company. This a huge deal. Why? Because the French are still so hesitant to admit the U.S. is making great wine. Even after the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, a.k.a. Judgment of Paris. (Watch Bottle Shock here if you don’t know what I’m talking about, to get a pretty good recap of what happened). In a nutshell, it was a wine competition organized in Paris on May 24, 1976 by Steven Spurrier, a British wine merchant. He gathered famous French judges and carried out two blind tastings: one of Chardonnays and another of reds (Bordeaux wines from France and Cabernet Sauvignon wines from California). And shocker! A California wine rated best in each category, which blew the minds of the French because the France was generally regarded as being the foremost producer of the world's best wines. Still, we didn’t get much respect. Then in 1979, came the famous Opus One -- the result of a wine collaboration between the Robert Mondavi’s son Timothy in Oakville, Calif. and Bordeaux's Château Mouton Rothschild winemaker Lucien Sionneau. But then there wasn’t much collaboration after that --until now. The Araujo Estate, founded 23 years ago, is one of Napa Valley’s elite Cabernet Sauvignon producers. The price of the sale to the Artemis Group purchase was not disclosed, but is likely to have been at least 300,000 per acre, says James Molesworth, senior editor at Wine Spectator magazine. The sale included the Eisele Vineyard, 38 acres of vines, the winery and existing stocks. The good news is that the current Araujo staff—including the winemaking team led by Françoise Peschon—will remain with the estate under its new ownership. So are the French starting to realize that not only do does the U.S. make great wine, but it's actually a much better place to do business? One reason why we haven't seen more sales like this is because buying and selling a winery has to pass a lot of rules in France, says Molesworth. He says that Francois Pinault had the cash flow to bypass those stringent rules, not everyone does. So will we see more of this? I say yes. Our wine is that good. What do you think? Cent’ Anni. Summary:","output":"Araujo Estate Wines, a Californian winery, has been sold to the family of French businessman Francois Pinault through their Artemis Group holding company. This is a significant deal because the French have been hesitant to admit that the US produces excellent wine.

Question 2: Can I treat acne scars with petroleum jelly? How does it help? OPTIONS:  -no;  -yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. They are both inquiring about the effectiveness of petroleum jelly in treating acne scars and how to apply it. I will provide a detailed response to address both questions. Petroleum jelly, commonly known as Vaseline, is an occlusive moisturizer that can help keep your skin hydrated by forming a protective barrier that prevents water loss. However, it is important to note that petroleum jelly does not contain any active ingredients that specifically target or treat acne scars. That being said, there are indirect ways in which petroleum jelly may help improve the appearance of acne scars. By providing adequate moisture to the skin, you can promote a healthy environment for cell regeneration and wound healing, which could potentially help improve the overall look and texture of scars. Additionally, preventing your skin from becoming excessively dry can minimize the risk of further irritation and the formation of new acne, allowing your existing scars to heal and fade over time. To apply petroleum jelly to acne scars, follow these steps: 1. Cleanse your face: Ensure your skin is clean and free of any dirt or oils by washing with a gentle cleanser. 2. Pat your skin dry: Gently pat your skin with a clean towel to remove excess water. 3. Apply treatment: If you are using any acne treatments or scar-specific serums, apply them first and allow them to absorb into your skin. 4. Apply petroleum jelly: Using clean fingers or a cotton swab, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly directly onto the acne scar or any dry areas. Be cautious not to apply too much, as this could make your skin greasy and potentially clog pores, leading to new breakouts. 5. Apply a moisturizer and/or sunscreen: Continue your skincare routine by applying a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer and/or sunscreen. This will help lock in hydration and protect your skin from UV-damage, which can worsen the appearance of acne scars. While petroleum jelly may indirectly help with the appearance of acne scars, it is essential to note that there are more effective treatments specifically designed to target and treat scars. These treatments include products containing ingredients such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, or retinoids.

Movie title: Dumbo Context: As a circus train makes it's way to the first of many show stops, a stork arrives with a baby for one elephant, named Mrs Jumbo. The other female pachyderms are charmed by the little baby, until he sneezes, revealing that he has a pair of oversized ears. Their words take on a different tune as they make fun of the little baby, giving him the ridiculing name of Dumbo. Dumbo's Mother just ignores their taunts and still cares for her child.At the circus' first venue, the elephants are put on exhibition for a number of people. However, one young boy makes fun of Dumbo, and also ends up pulling on his ears. This causes Mrs Jumbo to protect her son, but her actions cause the Ringmaster and the other circus people to claim her to be a mad elephant, and she is locked away.After this incident, none of the other elephants show any compassion or want to help Dumbo after his Mother is taken away. The only one who comes to his aid in friendship is a little mouse named Timothy. Dumbo is at first scared of Timothy (as he is a mouse), but Timothy's words of wanting to help get Dumbo's Mother released makes him realize the little mouse also means well. Timothy feels that Dumbo just needs to prove himself, and while the Ringmaster is asleep, whispers the idea for an elaborate performance by the elephants.The elephants climb on top of each other, and the plan is for Dumbo to be launched to the top, holding a little flag. However, Dumbo trips over his ears, and ends up toppling the stacked elephants, which causes the circus tent to collapse.After this, Dumbo is given the rather embarrassing role of being painted as a clown, and put into a rather degrading circus act. Dumbo just feels even worse, but Timothy manages to take him to see his Mother, which cheers him up a little. Later on in the evening, Dumbo develops the hiccups, and Timothy finds a tub of water in the clown's tent. However, one of the clowns has knocked some liquor into it, and Dumbo and Timothy end up getting tipsy, and soon start hallucinating, seeing pink...

Information:  - Edmond Gareginovich Keosayan (9 October 1936  21 April 1994) was an Armenian Soviet film director and musician.  - Mosfilm (\\"Mosfilm\\" ) is a film studio that is among the largest and oldest in the Russian Federation and in Europe. Its output includes most of the more widely acclaimed Soviet-era films, ranging from works by Andrei Tarkovsky and Sergei Eisenstein (commonly considered the greatest Soviet directors), to Red Westerns, to the Akira Kurosawa co-production \\"Dersu Uzala\\" (') and the epic \\"War and Peace\\" (').  - The Ostern (Eastern) or Red Western (also known as \\"Borscht Western\\") was the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries' take on the Western. The term refers to two related genres:  - Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. His wife Yko Yaguchi was also an actress in one of his films.  - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.  - The Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Neulovimye mstiteli\\") is a 1967 Soviet adventure film directed by Edmond Keosayan and made by Mosfilm. It is loosely based on the novel Little Red Devils by Pavel Blyakhin, under its original name. The film is an example of Ostern, set in Russian Civil War era Ukraine.  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.  - The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers ( Russian :    , translit . Novye prikluchenya Neulovimykh ) is a 1968 Soviet action movie , a sequel of The Elusive Avengers , directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm . The movie was followed by The Crown of the Russian Empire , or Once Again the Elusive Avengers released in 1971 .  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Crown of the Russian Empire, or Once Again the Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Korona Rossiyskoy Imperii, ili Snova Neulovimye\\") is a 1971 Soviet action movie, a second sequel of \\"The Elusive Avengers\\", directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm.

Q:Information:  - The Varsity Match is an annual rugby union fixture played between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England. The event began in 1872, with interruptions only for the two World Wars. Since 1921, the game has been played at Twickenham Stadium, London. It is normally played in early December.  - The University of Oxford (informally Oxford University or simply Oxford) is a collegiate research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled northeast to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \\"ancient universities\\" are frequently jointly referred to as \\"Oxbridge\\".  - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon.  - The Oxford University Rugby Football Club ( Oxford University RFC or OURFC ) is the rugby union club of the University of Oxford . The club contests The Varsity Match every year against Cambridge University at Twickenham .  - Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.  - Approximately 330 to 360 million people speak English as their first language. More than half of these (231 million) live in the United States, followed by some 55 million in England, the first place where English was spoken.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey.  - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Cambridge is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam about north of London. At the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 123,867, including 24,488 students.  - Twickenham Stadium (usually known as Twickenham or Twickers) is a rugby union stadium in Twickenham, south west London, England. Owned by the governing body of rugby union in England, the Rugby Football Union (the RFU), the stadium hosts home test matches for the England national rugby union team. Other rugby union games played at the stadium include the Middlesex Sevens, the Aviva Premiership final, the LV Cup, the Varsity Match between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and European Rugby Champions Cup matches. The RFU headquarters are based in the stadium.   - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area.  - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line.  - Oxbridge is a portmanteau (blend word) of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The term is used to refer to them collectively in contrast to other British universities and more broadly to describe characteristics reminiscent of them, often with implications of superior social or intellectual status.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.

In November of 1948, Bob Corey is an American soldier badly wounded at the end of World War II, and undergoing a number of surgical operations on his spine at the Birmingham Veterans Hospital in Van Nuys, California. He is tended by a nurse, Julie Benson, and they have fallen in love. Corey's military pal, Steve Connolly, arrives in early November to discuss plans for the ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona, they plan to purchase and operate together once Corey is out of the hospital. The two men pool their G.I. benefits (totaling 40,000) to do so. Corey's final surgery is in mid-December, but Connolly does not appear at the hospital afterward to see his friend. By Christmas, Corey is still in recovery but Connolly still remains absent. One night, as Corey lies semi-conscious in bed after being administered a sleeping drug, a woman with a Swedish accent appears at his  bedside. She says Connolly has been in a horrible accident; his spine is shattered and he wants to die, but she has refused to help him commit suicide. The woman asks Corey what to do, and he advises her to do nothing to harm Steve, and just to wait. Corey slips into unconsciousness, and the woman disappears. After New Year's Day, Corey is released from the hospital. He is immediately stopped by police detectives and then questioned by Captain Garcia of the Los Angeles Police, who tells him that Connolly is wanted for the murder of Solly Blayne, a local high-stakes gambler and racketeer murdered at his home in Los Feliz.

Perhaps influenced by van Eyck's Madonna in the Church, Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of \\"protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red\\". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's Crucifixion, where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John's red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives. Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece.Unlike the painters in the Low Countries, Lochner was not so concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly \\"drawn into empathy with the revolving forms\\".Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works, it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of...

Choices:  - purring - four paws - four legs - two eyes - whiskers  The rationale to choose \\"whiskers\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Whiskers are the most likely choice to cause a tickling sensation when interacting with cats due to their unique structure, function, and sensitivity. Here is a detailed explanation of the rationale behind choosing \\"whiskers\\" as the answer: 1. Whiskers are specialized hairs: Whiskers, also known as vibrissae, are long, thick, and flexible hairs that protrude from the cat's upper lip, cheeks, and eyebrow area. They are stiffer than the regular fur and have a unique structure, which makes them ideal to create a tickling sensation on human skin. 2. Sensitivity: Whiskers are highly sensitive tactile organs, as each whisker is connected to a bundle of nerves within the cat's face, enabling them to gather a wealth of information about their surroundings. They can detect even the slightest changes in air currents, which in turn helps them navigate their environment. This sensitivity to touch and air movement makes whiskers more likely to be the cause of the tickling sensation. 3. Function: The primary function of a cat's whiskers is to serve as a tactile sensory aid. They use them as a type of \\"antenna\\" to help sense objects, judge distances, and determine if they can squeeze through tight spaces. When a cat is interacting with you, they may brush their whiskers against your skin, which could tickle you due to the flexibility and sensitivity of these hairs. 4. Comparison with other choices: - Purring: While purring can create vibrations that might be soothing or provide a sense of comfort, it is not likely to cause a tickling sensation. Purring is a vocalization and does not involve any physical touch. - Four paws or four legs: While cats' paws and legs can be furry and have a gentle touch, they are not specialized structures meant to provide any sensory functions, making them less likely to cause a tickling sensation compared to whiskers. - Two eyes: A cat's eyes serve primarily for vision and are not responsible for any tactile sensations. Therefore, it makes no sense to consider eyes as the cause of the tickling sensation. In conclusion, considering the unique structure, sensitivity, and function of a cat's whiskers, it is most likely that whiskers are responsible for the tickling sensation you feel when interacting with cats. None of the other choices provided have the tactile properties that would create this sensation. So, \\"whiskers\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now. If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam, or the manner in which those who returned were treated, then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost. Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves, and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world, as the saying goes. First Blood Part II, on the other hand, is little more than a fist-pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be, both in victory and defeat. Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando, while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient. Where it all comes undone is in the script, which didn't do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris. What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone, as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambo's massive chest. The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood. The film, that is - the novel didn't allow for the possibility of sequels. In this mediocre follow-up, Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open-air mine. As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat, a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman, who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission. Rambo, never one to back down from a hard day's violent work, accepts, and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand (I forget which). From there, he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held, and photograph them. His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release. Rambo being Rambo, however, has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications. Of course, things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambo's work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found. It is the age-old conspiracy theory, and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for. Of course, with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s, they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians. Together, the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo, but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets, arrows, rockets, and destruction. About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a grail-like chalice and declares himself invincible. To be honest, First Blood Part II is a well-photographed, and well-choreographed, action spectacle. The hand-to-hand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to. Fortunately, this fad of America über alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds. Some of the kills shown here are quite creative, despite all the problems. The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy. The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous. Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter. Sure, there have been action film clichés rooted in contradictions of fact, but never this ridiculous before. I gave Rambo: First Blood Part II a one out of ten. It is so bad it is ridiculous, and so ridiculous that it is often funny. One doesn't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are. The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Cantopop (a contraction of \\"Cantonese pop music\\") or HK-pop (short for \\"Hong Kong pop music\\") is a genre of Cantonese music made primarily in Hong Kong, and also used to refer to the cultural context of its production and consumption. Originating in the 1970s, Cantopop reached its height of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s before its slow decline in the 2000s. The term \\"Cantopop\\" itself was coined in 1978 after \\"Cantorock\\", a term first used in 1974. During its height, Cantopop had spread to China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.  - Smile is the sixth album by Fiona ( Chinese :  ) , and was released on December 19 , 2008 . This is the first Cantopop album since Electric Angel two years earlier .  - South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a sovereign state in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula.  - Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, and often referred to as the \\"Lion City\\" or the \\"Little Red Dot\\", is a sovereign city-state in Southeast Asia, and the world's only island city-state. It lies one degree (137 km) north of the equator, south of the southernmost tip of continental Asia and peninsular Malaysia, with Indonesia's Riau Islands to the south. Singapore's territory consists of a diamond-shaped main island along with 62 other islets. Since independence, extensive land reclamation has increased its total size by 23% (130 km), and its greening policy has covered the densely populated island with tropical flora, parks and gardens.  - Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the Pearl River Delta of East Asia. Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory.  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

NEW YORK (CNN) -- After spending nearly 28 years in an irreversible coma, heiress and socialite Martha \\"Sunny\\" von Bulow died Saturday in a New York nursing home, according to a family statement. She was 76.  Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg.  Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s.  Her husband, Claus, was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin, which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma.  He was convicted of making two attempts on her life, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. He was acquitted in a second trial.  His retrial in 1985 received national attention.  \\"We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother,\\" said the statement from Von Bulow's three children -- Annie Laurie \\"Ala\\" Isham, Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman. \\"She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members.\\"  Martha von Bulow was born Martha Sharp Crawford into a wealthy family. She inherited a fortune conservatively estimated at 75 million, according to an article on the von Bulow case posted on truTV.com's Crime Library Web site.  In her early years, she drew comparisons to actress Grace Kelly.  She became known as Princess von Auersperg with her first marriage, to Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria.

The Canada 2011 Census is a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population on May 10, 2011. Statistics Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, conducts a nationwide census every five years. In 2011, it consisted of a mandatory short form census questionnaire and an inaugural National Household Survey (NHS), a voluntary survey which replaced the mandatory long form census questionnaire; this substitution was the focus of much controversy. Completion of the (short form) census is mandatory for all Canadians, and those who do not complete it may face penalties ranging from fines to prison sentences.  The Statistics Act mandates a Senate and/or House of Commons (joint) committee review of the opt-in clause (for the release of one's census records after 92 years) by 2014.  The 2011 Census is the fifteenth decennial census and is required by section 8 of the \\"Constitution Act, 1867\\". As with other decennial censuses, the data was used to adjust federal electoral district boundaries.  As of August 24, 2011, Canada's overall collection response rate was 98.1%, up over a percentage point from 96.5% in the 2006 Census.

To understand the translation, let's break down each word: 1. \\"Heistä\\" translates to \\"They\\" in English. In the Finnish language, pronouns are commonly used in the beginning of the sentences. 2. \\"Tulee\\" is a form of the verb \\"Tulla\\" used in Finnish which means \\"to come\\" or \\"to become\\". In the sentence, it is used as \\"become\\". 3. \\"Valmistelukunnan\\" is a compound term consisting of \\"valmistelu\\" which means \\"preparation\\" or \\"preparatory\\", and \\"kunnan\\" which is the genitive form of \\"kunta\\", means \\"committee\\". When combined, it translates to \\"of the preparatory committee\\". Finnish language often combines words to form longer compound words that contain more specific meanings.  4. \\"Jäseniä\\" is the partitive plural form of \\"jäsen\\", which means \\"member\\". The partitive case in Finnish is used to express partialness, here, it is used to indicate unspecified number of members, thus, translated as \\"members\\". Overall, \\"Heistä tulee valmistelukunnan jäseniä\\" directly translates to \\"They become members of the preparatory committee\\" in English. It implies that some people are joining a committee that is tasked with preparing for something, although without more context, we can't say what that something is.

Article:","output":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Mirror Shine for a Weathered Look Introduction Mirror shine can make a surface appear polished, pristine, and high-gloss. However, sometimes a more weathered, dull, and textured appearance is desirable for certain projects, whether it be for aesthetic purposes or to create a vintage effect. Fortunately, there is a simple and effective process for removing mirror shine using common household products. In this article, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of transforming a mirror-shining surface to achieve a weathered look. Step One: Wax Stripping The first step in removing a mirror shine is to use a wax stripping product, which is specifically designed for dissolving and lifting wax from surfaces. Wax stripping products can be easily found at most home improvement or automotive stores and are available in spray or liquid forms. Using a wax stripper is essential to break down the layers of wax that produce the mirror shine, ensuring a successful transformation to a weathered look. 1. Apply the wax stripping product: Follow the instructions on the packaging to apply the wax stripper to your surface. Most wax stripping products will need to be applied generously to ensure the entire surface is covered.     2. Allow it to soak: Give the wax stripper time to soak into the surface and break down the wax for effective removal. The recommended soaking time will typically be specified on the product packaging.      3. Remove the wax: After the indicated soaking time, use a clean cloth or sponge to wipe away the wax stripper, taking care not to scratch the surface. You should start to see the mirror shine diminishing. Step Two: Rubbing Alcohol The next step in achieving a dull, weathered appearance is to spray the surface with rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol). Rubbing alcohol acts as a degreaser and aids in removing any remaining wax residue, further dulling the surface. 1. Spray rubbing alcohol: Lightly mist the surface with rubbing alcohol, making sure to cover the entire area evenly.     2. Allow it to sit: Give the rubbing alcohol time to work on the surface, usually about 2-5 minutes will be sufficient.      3. Wipe clean: Using another clean cloth or sponge, wipe the rubbing alcohol away from the surface. The surface should have a more dulled, weathered appearance by this point. Step Three: Acetone Nail Polish Remover The final step for removing color and shine is to apply acetone nail polish remover. Acetone is a powerful solvent that will help dissolve any remaining shine-inducing elements and can also remove color from the surface. 1. Apply acetone nail polish remover: Soak a clean cloth or sponge with the acetone nail polish remover and apply it gently to the surface.     2. Let it work: Give the acetone some time to work on the surface and start dissolving any remaining shine and color. Usually, a few minutes should suffice.      3. Remove acetone: Finally, use a clean, dry cloth to wipe away the acetone nail polish remover. Conclusion By following this three-step process, you can easily and effectively remove a mirror shine from a surface and achieve a dull, weathered appearance. The use of wax stripping products, rubbing alcohol, and acetone nail polish remover ensures that your surface will be transformed with minimal effort and without damaging the underlying material."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I haven't finish this book, but one thing I can tell you, it's very, very good, I'm not an expert in the field of COM+ and for this matter I'm telling you this, it's very clear and explicit, I'm not sure if it's complete, but it's some of the best books I've read and to read it's some of my few entertainments I read a book like this in about a month or less, 10 days if I'm on pressure, if you're not an expert like me, buy this one you won't regret it.

Write some highlights for the following article: There is no basic human right to barge into a church to make a political statement, jump around near the altar, and shout obscenities. But there is most certainly the right not to lose your liberty for doing so, even if the act is offensive. But that is exactly what happened Friday. A court in Moscow sentenced the three members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot to two years in prison. In my two decades monitoring human rights in Russia I've never seen anything like the Pussy Riot case -- the media attention, the outpouring of public support, the celebrity statements for the detained and criminally charged punk band members. The image of three young women facing down an inexorable system of unfair justice and an oppressive state has crystallized for many in the West what is wrong with human rights in Russia. To be sure, it is deeply troubling. For me, even more shocking were the images of Stanislav Markelov, a human rights lawyer, lying on the sidewalk with the back of his head blown off in 2009, or the body of tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009 after he blew the whistle on a massive government extortion scheme. The Pussy Riot case shines a much needed, if highly disturbing, spotlight on the issue of freedom of expression in post-Soviet Russia. On February 21, four members of the group performed what they call a \\"punk prayer\\" in Moscow's Russian Orthodox Christ the Savior Cathedral. They danced around and shouted some words to their song, \\"Virgin Mary, Get Putin Out.\\" The stunt lasted less than a minute before the women were forcibly removed. The same day, a video widely shared on social media showed a montage of the stunt with the song spliced in. The song criticizes the Russian Orthodox Church's alleged close relationship with the Kremlin and the personally close relationship of President Vladimir V. Putin with the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Three of the band members were tried on criminal \\"hooliganism\\" charges. Their trial was theater of the absurd. In their closing statements, the women and their lawyers delivered devastating critiques of the state of justice and civic freedoms in Russia. During the Soviet era, the human rights landscape in Russia was stark. But since then the situation has been harder to figure out, often making it easier for outsiders simply to give the government a pass. But the devil is in the details. It has been incredibly difficult to pin down any involvement of officials in the beatings and murders of investigative journalists and human rights activists. And the government, while not silencing civil society groups outright, tries to marginalize, discredit, and humiliate them, and crush them with heavy-handed bureaucracy, trumped-up accusations, threats and the like. Whatever misdemeanor the three women incurred for their antics in the church should not have been transformed by the authorities into a criminal offense that in effect punishes them for their speech. It's typical, though, of how the authorities try to keep a lid on controversial issues. The Russian think tank SOVA has documented dozens of cases in recent years in which the authorities used the threat of extremism charges to silence critics. This also isn't the first time Russian authorities have misused criminal legislation to stifle critical artistic expression. In 2010 a Moscow district court found the co-organizers of a controversial art exhibit guilty of the vague charge of \\"inciting religious hatred.\\" The art exhibit organizers were fined. By making the Pussy Riot band members await trial in jail for almost six months, the authorities made clear how they plan to set boundaries for political criticism. After a winter of unprecedented, peaceful opposition protests, a dozen demonstrators whom the authorities claim were involved in a scuffle with police during a mass demonstration in May have been arrested and are being charged with crimes grossly disproportionate to their alleged actions. Police have searched opposition leaders' homes. Laws rammed through Russia's parliament this summer sent more signals: criminal liability for leaders of nongovernmental organizations for \\"serious breaches\\" of new restrictive regulations; much tougher sanctions for violating rules on public assembly; and new restrictions on the Internet that could easily shut down big social networking sites. Critics of the Kremlin have been subject to vicious harassment, intimidation and grotesque public smear campaigns. For years Russian human rights defenders have tried to draw attention to the lack of independence of the courts. With the unprecedented attention to the Pussy Riot trial, the surreal state of justice when political interests are at stake is there for all to see. What we really should be wondering isn't why Pussy Riot is so distinctive, but whether it's just the tip of the iceberg. Too often, foreign governments have resorted to wishful thinking about the direction Russia is heading. Talking about human rights at a high level -- where all things in Russia are decided -- is unpleasant business. It might be hard, but Russia won't respect other governments if they shy away. If three women in the defendants' cage had the courage to speak out about where Russia is headed, surely members of the international community should too. They, at least, won't be thrown in jail. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rachel Denber. Highlights:","output":"1. Three members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot were sentenced to two years in prison on Friday in Moscow for conducting what they called a \\"punk prayer\\" in a cathedral, an act seen as a form of protest against the close relationship between the Church and the Kremlin.  2. The case has attracted significant media attention and large public support and has become symbolic of the human rights situation in Russia, particularly regarding freedom of speech. 3. The band deliberately made a political statement against President Putin's relationship with the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Their trial, in which they faced \\"hooliganism\\" charges, was dubbed a \\"theatre of the absurd\\" with stark criticism by the band and their lawyers on the state of justice and civic freedoms in Russia. 4. The author, Rachel Denber, argues that the authorities have tried to suppress those who openly criticize the regime by using legal means. Previous cases where legislation has been used to stifle critical expression include labeling artwork inciting religious hatred and prosecuting opposition protestors for crimes disproportionate to their actions. 5.

She calls on the international community to speak out and not succumb to wishful thinking regarding improvements in the human rights situation. 6. The Russian authorities' tactics include marginalization, discreditation, humiliation, and bureaucratic measures in an attempt to quash civil society groups and independent thought. 7.

Hypothesis: Charitable scalawags shared their booty with folks in the Balearics.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise and the hypothesis appear to be unrelated; thus, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. To better understand this, let's analyze the two statements in detail. Premise: Burgeoning trade in the Balearics was interrupted by marauding pirates based in North Africa as well as by the powerful Turkish fleet. In this premise, we have three primary components: trade in the Balearics, North African pirates, and the Turkish fleet. The focus of the premise is on the interruption of trade, which was adversely affected by both the pirate activities and the Turkish fleet. The premise provides information about the negative impact of these external threats to the trade and economy in the Balearics. Hypothesis: Charitable scalawags shared their booty with folks in the Balearics. The hypothesis introduces the notion of charitable scalawags, pirates or criminals who are assumed to share their stolen goods with the local population in the Balearics. This statement does not provide any direct information about the source of the booty, that is whether the stolen goods were a result of the marauding activities of North African pirates or the Turkish fleet. Therefore, the connection between the premise and the hypothesis remains unclear. The premise does not support or entail the hypothesis since it does not provide any direct evidence or logical connection that would lead us to assume that charitable scalawags were sharing their stolen goods with the people in the Balearics. The hypothesis is an independent idea with no discernable ties to the premise. Both statements provide tidbits of information about the Balearics, but the premise does not contain sufficient information or logical premises to conclude that the hypothesis is a result of the initial premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

M.I.A. promoted the album with a series of appearances at music festivals, including the Hard festival in New York and The Big Chill in Herefordshire. Her performance at the latter was cut short due to a stage invasion by fans. She also performed at the Flow Festival in Finland, where she was joined onstage by Derek E. Miller playing guitar during her performance of \\"Meds and Feds\\", and the LokerseFeesten in Lokeren, Flanders, Belgium, where her performance drew a crowd of 13,500, the biggest of the 10-day music festival. In September she announced a tour that would last until the end of the year.M.I.A. also promoted the album with an appearance on the \\"Late Show with David Letterman\\", during which she performed \\"Born Free\\" with Martin Rev of Suicide playing keyboards, backed by a group of dancers styled to look like M.I.A. In November 2010 she appeared on the British television show Later... with Jools Holland, performing \\"Born Free\\" and \\"It Takes a Muscle\\", the latter with members of The Specials. While promoting the album, M.I.A. became involved in a dispute with Lynn Hirschberg of The New York Times, who interviewed her in March 2010 and whose resulting article portrayed the singer as pretentious and attention seeking. In response, M.I.A. posted Hirschberg's telephone number on her Twitter page and later uploaded her own audio recording of the interview, highlighting the discrepancies between what she said and what was reported. The piece was criticised for its yellow journalism by some, however M.I.A. received varying degrees of support and criticism for the ensuing fallout from the media.

Now, let's solve the math problem step by step. 1. We start with the equation: 11 * u - 35 = 4 * u 2. We want to get all the \\"u\\" terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. So, let's move 4 * u from the right side to the left side by subtracting it.    11 * u - 4 * u - 35 = 0 3. Now let's combine the \\"u\\" terms:    (11 - 4) * u - 35 = 0     7 * u - 35 = 0 4. Next, we will move 35 to the right side by adding it to both sides:    7 * u = 35 5. Finally, we need to find the value of \\"u\\". To do that, let's divide both sides by 7:    u = 35 / 7 So, u is equal to 5. In simpler words, if you have 11 sets of something and take away 35 of that something, you'll be left with 4 sets of that same something; and each set has 5 items in it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films. The story is just fantastic. It's so original and so entertaining. The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named \\"La Jetée\\" (1962) which I haven't seen, but I must thank the director and writer of the movie, Chris Marker, for giving such an inspiration for the writers of \\"Twelve Monkeys\\". I read a little about \\"La Jetée\\", it's not the same story but it has the same idea, so this is not just a copy of it. David and Janet Peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story, which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. The music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling, composed by Paul Buckmaster. Terry Gilliam, who we remember from Monty Python, as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me, as I really never thought him as a director type of a person. I know he has directed movies before, but I really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. It shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job. You can still sense that same weirdness as in the Python's, but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. Yes, it is indeed odd, weird, bizarre and disturbing, so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too, so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. It's not as heavy as you could imagine, but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. Despite that, the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks, dreams, jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part, though it does need concentration from the viewer after all. What comes to acting, well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. The role of James Cole is played by the mighty Bruce Willis, who probably does his best role performance yet to date. Now people may disagree with me, as he did some fine job in for example \\"The Sixth Sense\\" as well, but for me the role of James Cole was so ideal for Willis and he performs it incredibly well. The character is very well written too, yet performed even better. Cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself, starting to question his actual time of living, trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. By hardship he starts to loose his faith, questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. Other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of Madeleine Stow and Brad Pitt. Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist of James Cole, who sees something strangely familiar in Cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. She somehow starts to believe Cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. Brad Pitt is so good in the role of Jeffrey Goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. The insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought Pitt even an Oscar nomination for it, so I guess I'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing. All in all, \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from Willis and Pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. It's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures I've ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really, but that's how it is, it's mind blowing.","output":"The sentiment of this text is predominantly positive.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Question: What state was Burton playing college ball in when he was drafted? Passage 1:The Oakland Athletics selected Burton out of Western Carolina University in the eighth round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. He lost his remaining eligibility at Western Carolina by signing with Oakland on June 12, 2002. The A's sent him to their Single-A affiliate, the Vancouver Canadians. With Vancouver he had a 0–4 win–loss record with a 3.58 earned run average (ERA) in 13 games. He followed up his 2002 season with 15 appearances for the Kane County Cougars in 2003. With Kane County he improved both his win–loss ratio to a 2–1 and his ERA to 2.27. The 2004 season was less consistent for Burton, splitting time between two of the Athletics farm teams, the Arizona League Athletics (AZL Athletics) (Rookie League) and the Modesto A's (Single-A). Burton had a 1–0 record and a 4.16 ERA with the AZL Athletics. While in Modesto he had a 3–2 win–loss ratio and a 4.78 ERA. Overall, Burton pitched a combined 53.2 innings in 15 games in 2004. Burton spent the 2005 season with the Stockton Ports, another Oakland Single-A affiliate and went 4–4 with a 2.60 ERA. The 2006 season would turn out to be Burton's final year in Oakland's farm system, and Burton spent it with the Midland RockHounds. With the RockHounds he had a 6–5 record and a 4.14 ERA in a then career high 53 appearances.  Passage 2:The right to marry a person of a different race was addressed in Loving v. Virginia, in which the Court said, in 1967, that its decision striking down anti-miscegenation laws could be justified either by substantive due process, or by the Equal Protection Clause. The unconstitutionality of bans on and refusals to recognize same-sex marriage was decided partly on substantive due process grounds by Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015. A right to have children was addressed in Skinner v. Oklahoma, but the Court in Skinner, in 1942, explicitly declined to base its decision on due process but instead cited the Equal Protection Clause since the Oklahoma law required sterilization of some three-time felons but not others. A substantive due process right of a parent to educate a young child (before ninth grade) in a foreign language was recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, in 1923, with two justices dissenting, and Justice Kennedy has mentioned that Meyer might be decided on different grounds in modern times. Laws that \\"shock the conscience\\" of the Court were generally deemed unconstitutional, in 1952, in Rochin v. California, but in concurring, Justices Black and Douglas argued that pumping a defendant's stomach for evidence should have been deemed unconstitutional on the narrower ground that it violates the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination. The Court, in O'Connor v. Donaldson, in 1975, said that due process is violated by confining a nondangerous mentally ill person who is capable of surviving safely in freedom. Chief Justice Burger's concurring opinion was that such confinement may also amount to \\"punishment\\" for being mentally ill, violating the Court's interpretation of the Eighth Amendment in Robinson v. California. Freedom from excessive punitive damages was deemed to be a due process right in BMW v. Gore, in 1996, but four justices disagreed. The Court, in Cruzan v. Missouri, decided, in 1990, that due process is not violated if a state applies \\"a clear and convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state\\".  Passage 3:The time from roughly 15,000 to 5,000 BC was a time of transition, and swift and extensive environmental change, as the planet was moving from an Ice age, towards an interstadial (warm period). Sea levels rose dramatically (and are continuing to do so), land that was depressed by glaciers began lifting up again, forests and deserts expanded, and the climate gradually became more modern. In the process of warming up, the planet saw several \\"cold snaps\\" and \\"warm snaps\\", such as the Older Dryas and the Holocene climatic optimum, as well as heavier precipitation. In addition, the Pleistocene megafauna became extinct due to environmental and evolutionary pressures from the changing climate. This marked the end of the Quaternary extinction event, which was continued into the modern era by humans.

I'm going to explain the differences to you between car struts and car shocks, and about the car alarm and battery. Let's go! 1. Car struts and car shocks: Imagine that cars are like big toy cars. When they run on the roads, they go on bumps andholes. Car struts and car shocks help make the ride feel smooth. Car struts and car shocks may look similar, but they have differences: - Car struts: They're like strong legs that hold the car up and help it bounce less when it goes over bumps. Struts also help the car wheels stay in place and turn when you steer. - Car shocks: They work like special springs that help the car bounce less too, but they don't help with holding the car up or turning the wheels. They just make the ride smoother. 2. Car alarm and battery: A car alarm is like a little guard that makes loud noises when it thinks someone might be trying to take your toy car without permission. When the alarm goes off, it uses energy from the car's battery. If the alarm keeps going off for a long time, it's like using lots of energy from your toy's battery to make the loud noises. So, yes, a car alarm going off for too long can drain your battery, which means your toy car might not work until you put more energy back into the battery. Now, are these questions the same? Nope! They are different because one asks about car struts and shocks (how cars stay smooth on bumpy roads), and the other asks about car alarms and batteries (how an alarm can make your car's battery lose energy).

Use a 2 quart (2 liter) plastic bottle and fill it ¾ of the way with water. You can either use water from a local pond or stream, or from the tap. Pond or stream water is preferable because you will also get small microorganisms that may be present in the water. If you have to use tap water, make sure that you let it sit in an open container for at least 24 hours before using in your ecosystem. The chlorine present in tap water may kill any animal or plant species that you add to your ecosystem. Letting the water sit for 24 hours gives the chlorine time to dissipate from the water. Next, add 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of tiny rocks or pebbles. You should always wash any rocks prior to adding them to your ecosystem. This will help remove any contaminants. At this stage you could also add one dead leaf. This will provide a food source for any microorganisms in the water. You can buy aquatic plants from your local pet supply store.

Question: Street art is very popular around the world. You can find it on buildings, street signs and trash cans from Tokyo to Paris, from Moscow to Cape Town. Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists. People have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture. Street art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. One well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. Nowadays the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to people around the world.

Movie title: Case Closed: Strategy Above the Depths Context: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogoro shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her.

The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career.

The opposite of subtracting 128 is adding 128. So, let's add 128 to both sides of the equation! Now, our equation looks like this: 20 * p = 332 + 128. If we add 332 and 128, we get 460. So the equation now looks like this: 20 * p = 460. Now, we just have to get rid of that multiplication with 20. The opposite of multiplying by 20 is dividing by 20, right?

[-] Yes; [-] No; The answer is:","output":"Yes, the correct answer is \\"nephrons.\\"  Nephrons are the functional units of the kidneys that play a crucial role in filtering blood. They maintain proper balance in the body by regulating water and solutes like sodium, potassium, and calcium. Additionally, nephrons remove harmful metabolic waste products from the blood, including urea and creatinine.  Composed of a glomerulus and a tubule, nephrons receive blood that is rich in waste material from the renal artery. The glomerulus is a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries that filter the blood by allowing water, ions, and small molecules to pass through. This part of the nephron prevents larger components, such as blood cells and proteins, from filtering out. This filtration process results in a fluid called the glomerular filtrate, which then enters the renal tubule. The tubule works in three segments: the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). As the filtrate passes through these segments, the tubules selectively reabsorb nutrients, ions, and water to balance electrolyte levels, proper pH, and maintain osmoregulation in the body. The remaining waste material is then concentrated in the collecting ducts and forms urine, which is transported to the bladder for eventual excretion. Overall, nephrons are essential in the filtering and purification of blood, ensuring optimal body function by maintaining balance in the body's fluids and eliminating waste products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is unclear whether Oliseh will be contesting the sanction. The 41-year-old posted a video on his own website to hit back at what he called the \\"insanity\\" of his critics. He had come under pressure after Nigeria failed to get past the group stages of the African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Rwanda. The coach has since apologised to the NFF for his outburst aimed at the Nigerian media as well as his vociferous former international teammates. \\"When I spoke of critics I did not mean the general public of Nigeria! I would never dare refer to my beloved country men as insane!\\" Oliseh published on his Twitter account.

Some high profile players have decided to retire since he took over as coach including goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama - Nigeria's most-capped player - who quit after he was replaced as captain. Two weeks later striker Emmanuel Emenike also announced his retirement from international football. Oliseh, unpaid for five months, had also gone public with the money problems affecting his team during the CHAN tournament to the embarrassment of his employers.

She lives in a Brooklyn brownstone with her 10-year-old son Alex (Danny Corkill). One March morning, Susan sees Alex off to school, which is only two blocks away. Alex turns to wave to his mother, then disappears around the corner. Susan returns home after work, and becomes increasingly alarmed when Alex is late. She calls her friend and neighbor Jocelyn Norris, whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and learns Alex never went to school. She immediately calls the New York City Police Department, and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti. Susan is questioned closely on all aspects of her life and her son's, and initially suspect her estranged husband, Graham, a professor at New York University, but he produces an alibi. Susan's case generates attention from the local media, and citizens help in the search by distributing posters. Susan is initially criticized for allowing her son to walk to school by himself. Susan takes a polygraph test that clears her as a suspect. Numerous leads are checked out, including several reports that Alex may have been seen in the back seat of a blue 1965 Chevy. A psychic is also called in, but each lead fizzles. The investigation drags on, and Graham is at odds with Menetti after budget cuts force Menetti to dismantle the command center in Susan's apartment and run the case from the precinct. Menetti's attention is soon diverted to other cases, but the Selky case is always a priority. At one point, Graham takes matters into his own hands after he receives a ransom call. Given a beating, he requires a hospital stay. A break in the case finally happens on the Fourth of July, when Susan's housecleaner, Philippe, is arrested as a suspect.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What institution was recommended by William Laver?, using the article: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

The first two are named the lateral ventricles and are deep within the cerebrum. These ventricles are connected to the third ventricle by two openings called the interventricular foramina. The third ventricle is the space between the left and right sides of the diencephalon, which opens into the cerebral aqueduct that passes through the midbrain.

Some of these species have been placed with the great herons in Ardea , and conversely the large white species like great egret are occasionally allocated to Egretta . The fact that some of the group are named \`\` heron '' and some \`\` egret '' has no taxonomic significance .  - Botaurus is a genus of bitterns, a group of wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae. The genus name \\"Botaurus\\" was given by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens, and is derived from Medieval Latin \\"butaurus\\", \\"bittern\\", itself constructed from the Middle English name for the Eurasian Bittern, \\"Botor\\". Pliny gave a fanciful derivation from \\"Bos\\" (ox) and \\"taurus\\" (bull), because the bittern's call resembles the bellowing of a bull.  - The herons are the long-legged freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae, with 64 recognised species, some of which are referred to as \\"egrets\\" or \\"bitterns\\" rather than herons. Members of the genera \\"Botaurus\\" and \\"Ixobrychus\\" are referred to as \\"bitterns\\", and, together with the zigzag heron or zigzag bittern in the monotypic genus \\"Zebrilus\\", form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae. Egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes. Although egrets have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller. Herons, by evolutionary adaptation, have long beaks.  - Bitterns are a classification of birds in the heron family of Pelican order of wading birds. Species named bitterns tend to be the shorter-necked, often more secretive members of this family. They were called \\"hæferblæte\\" in Old English; the word \\"bittern\\" came to English from Old French \\"butor\\", itself from Gallo-Roman \\"butitaurus\\", a compound of Latin \\"bti\\" and \\"taurus\\". Bitterns form a monophyletic subfamily in the heron family, the Botaurinae.  - Ixobrychus is a genus of bitterns, a group of wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae. \\"Ixobrychus\\" is from Ancient Greek \\"ixias\\", a reed-like plant and \\"brukhomai\\", to bellow.  - An egret is a bird that is any of several herons, most of which are white or buff, and several of which develop fine plumes (usually milky white) during the breeding season.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - The zigzag heron (\\"Zebrilus undulatus\\") is a species of heron in the family Ardeidae, also including egrets and bitterns. It is in the monotypic genus Zebrilus. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.

His first job, in 1962, was drawing novelty greeting cards for American Greetings in Cleveland, Ohio. He stayed with the company for four years, producing hundreds of cards for the company's Hi-Brow line; his superiors had him draw in a cuter style that was to leave a footprint on his work throughout his career. In Cleveland he met a group of young bohemians such as Buzzy Linhart, Liz Johnston, and Harvey Pekar. Dissatisfied with greeting card work, he tried to sell cartoons to comic book companies, who showed little interest in his work. In 1965, cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman printed some of Crumb's work in the humor magazine he edited, Help!. Crumb moved to New York, intending to work with Kurtzman, but Help! ceased publication shortly after. Crumb briefly illustrated bubblegum cards for Topps before returning to Cleveland and American Greetings.  Crumb married Dana Morgan in 1964. Nearly destitute, the couple traveled in Europe, during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings, and Dana stole food. The relationship was unstable as Crumb frequently went his own way, and he was not close to his son Jesse (b. 1965).  In 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of Fritz the Cat strips published in the men's magazine Cavalier. Fritz had appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s; he was to become a hipster, scam artist, and bohemian until Crumb abandoned the character in 1969.  Crumb was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his job and marriage when in June 1965 he began taking LSD, a psychedelic drug that was then still legal. He had both good and bad trips. One bad trip left him in a muddled state for half a year, during which for a time he left Dana; the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: From the moment that an animal is born it has to make decisions. It has to decide which of the things around it are for eating, and which are to be avoided; when to attack and when to run away. The animal is, in fact, playing a complicated and potentially dangerous game with its environment, discomfort or destruction. This is a difficult and unpleasant business and few animals would survive if they had to start from the beginning and learn about the world wholly by trial and error, for there are too many possible decisions which would prove fatal. So we find, in practice, that the game is always arranged in favor of the young animal in one way or another. Either the animal is protected during the early stages of its learning about the world around it, or the knowledge of which way to respond is built into its nervous system from the start. The fact that animals behave sensibly can be attributed partly to what we might call genetic learning, to distinguish it from individual learning that an animal does in the cause of its own life time. Genetic learning is learning by a species as a whole, and it is achieved by selection of those members of each generation that happen to behave in the right way. However, genetic learning depends upon a prediction that the future will more or less exactly resemble the past. The more variable individual experience is likely to be, the less efficient is genetic learning as a means of getting over the problems of the survival game. It is not surprising to find that very few species indeed depend wholly upon genetic learning.

It is not possible to tell The phrase \\"It's a good thing compared to how things were before\\" suggests that the present situation or development is better than the past one. However, without additional information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that something being available before would lead to an improvement or positive change. The specific circumstances, the nature of the things being compared, and the implications of having the item or service available earlier need to be taken into consideration before forming a conclusion. It is possible that having something available earlier could have led to positive outcomes, or it could have produced negative or unintended consequences. Consequently, it is essential to analyze the context in which the question is asked and evaluate the potential impact of the change. For example, consider the availability of a new medicine. If the medication was available earlier, it might have saved many lives, but it could have also had adverse effects on the environment or led to antibiotic resistance. In such cases, it would not be appropriate to conclude that the medicine's earlier availability was necessarily good or bad without sufficient information and analysis.

Tämä voi tapahtua eri syistä, kuten ylivarauksen, lentoyhtiönoperationalaisten ongelmien tai turvallisuusongelmien vuoksi. Kompensaatiojärjestelmän tarkoituksena on korvata näistä syistä aiheutuvat haitat ja kustannukset matkustajille sekä kannustaa lentoyhtiöitä parempaan asiakaspalveluun ja asianmukaiseen lentoliikenteen hallintaan. Kompensaatiojärjestelmän kattavuus ja korvausten määrä riippuvat pääasiassa kahdesta tekijästä: matkustajan kärsimästä haitasta ja matkan pituudesta. Euroopan unionin alueella toimiva lentoyhtiöiden kompensaatiojärjestelmä perustuu EU-lainsäädäntöön, nimittäin lentomatkustajien oikeuksia koskevaan asetukseen (EY) N:o 261/2004. Tämän asetuksen mukaan kompensaatiot vaihtelevat välillä 250-600 euroa matkan pituudesta, viivytyksen kestosta ja lentojen välimatkoista riippuen. Jos matkustaja on evätty lennolta ylivarauksen tai muun lentoyhtiöstä johtuvan syyn vuoksi, heillä on oikeus saada: 1. Lipun hintaan palautus tai vaihtoehtoinen reitti määränpäähän lentoyhtiön kustannuksella. 2. Ilmainen ruoka ja juoma odotusajan mukaan sekä kaksi ilmaista puhelua, sähköpostia tai faksia. 3. Tarvittaessa majoitus ja kuljetus lentokentälle, jos viivästyminen on yliwan yö. 4. Rahanarvoinen korvaus, jonka suuruus riippuu lennon pituudesta ja viivästyksen kestosta. On tärkeää huomata, että hylättyjen-nousujen kompensaatiojärjestelmä ei kata poikkeustilanteita, kuten äärimmäisiä sääolosuhteita, poliittisia levottomuuksia, turvallisuusuhkia tai lentoaseman henkilökunnan lakkoja, joita lentoyhtiö ei voi kohtuudella hallita. Finnish: Hylättyjen-nousujen kompensaatiojärjestelmä suunnitellussa lentoliikenteessä on kehitetty auttamaan matkustajia, jotka ovat kokeneet haittaa lentoyhtiöiden toiminnasta.

Järjestelmä tekee lentoyhtiöistä vastuullisempia asiakaspalvelun ja lennonhallinnan osalta, ja samalla sen ansiosta matkustajat tuntevat olonsa turvallisemmaksi ja arvostetuksi."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Review: Reviewed at the Sept 12, 2006 2nd screening at the Paramount 1 theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival. The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theatre VISA Screening Room. The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him, but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc. The downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain DVD bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops Freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager. He soon discovers the real-life market is run by a iron-willed \\"10 Items or Less\\" checkout line clerk played by Paz Vega. When Freeman's ride never returns and Vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get Freeman back home and to get Vega a job that'll get her on a more upwardly mobile career path. While the film was enjoyable, it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress. There were two extended musical sequences (One with Vega & Freeman teaching each other children's songs in the car, one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video) that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long. It's a good thing Morgan Freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little. Sure it was funny in parts and Paz Vega is a delight as well, but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film. They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and Paz Vega said she never does that. Who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no!? In the real world it's the exact opposite. Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits. The bit with a Target Store saleslady teaching Morgan Freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious! An early bit where Freeman's chauffeur insists it is Freeman's voice on a \\"Books on Tape\\" reading was also pretty funny. The director/writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a brief Q&A after the screening. Silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there. Quite a compliment for both Silberling's writing and also about how Freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it. Now, what is this review like? pick from the following. a). negative. b). positive.","output":"This review is b). positive. The person who wrote the review enjoyed the film, found it funny in parts, and thought that both Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega did a good job. However, they also mentioned that the film felt a bit incomplete and had some issues, like the musical sequences feeling like padding. Overall, they had a good time watching the film and appreciated the actors' performances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Information:  - In animal anatomy, the notochord is a flexible rod made out of a material similar to cartilage. If a species has a notochord, it is, by definition, a chordate. The notochord lies along the anteroposterior (\\"head to tail\\") axis, is usually closer to the dorsal than the ventral surface of the animal, and is composed of cells derived from the mesoderm. The notochord has been observed to have many functions including developmental functions. The most commonly cited functions are as a site of muscle attachment, vertebral precursor, and as a midline tissue that provides signals to the surrounding tissue during development.  - In zoological nomenclature, a subphylum is a taxonomic rank below the rank of phylum.   - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - The beak, bill, or rostrum is an external anatomical structure of birds that is used for eating and for grooming, manipulating objects, killing prey, fighting, probing for food, courtship and feeding young. The terms \\"beak\\" and \\"rostrum\\" are also used to refer to a similar mouth part in some dicynodonts, Ornithischians, cephalopods, cetaceans, billfishes, pufferfishes, turtles, Anuran tadpoles and sirens.  - Snail is a common name that is applied most often to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name \\"snail\\" is also applied to most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word \\"snail\\" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also thousands of species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Occasionally a few other molluscs that are not actually gastropods, such as the Monoplacophora, which superficially resemble small limpets, may also informally be referred to as \\"snails\\".  - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.  - Clam is the general common name of any mollusks within the class Bivalvia. More specifically, true clams are bivalves having two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and having a powerful burrowing foot. They are infaunal, spending most of their lives partially buried in the sand of the ocean floor. These characteristics distinguish the true clams from other bivalves, such as oysters, mussels, and scallops.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A claw is a curved , pointed appendage , found at the end of a toe or finger in most amniotes ( mammals , reptiles , birds ) . However , the word \`\` claw '' is also often used in reference to an invertebrate . Somewhat similar fine hooked structures are found in arthropods such as beetles and spiders , at the end of the leg or tarsus for gripping a surface as the creature walks . Crabs ' , lobsters ' and scorpions ' pincers , or more formally , their \`\` chelae '' , are sometimes called claws . A true claw , ( as opposed to a chela ) is made of hard protein called keratin . Claws are used to catch and hold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs , but may also be used for such purposes as digging , climbing trees , self - defense , and grooming , in those and other species . Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead . Claw - like projections that do not form at the end of digits , but spring from other parts of the foot are properly named spurs . Claws of animals like tigers , lions , and bears were used in making items such as ornaments , pendants , and brooches .  - Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting \\"tail\\" (abdomen) (= short, = tail), usually entirely hidden under the thorax. They live in all the world's oceans, in fresh water, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton and have a single pair of claws. Many other animals with similar names  such as hermit crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs, horseshoe crabs, and crab lice  are not true crabs.  - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.  - Starfish or sea stars are star-shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or \\"basket stars\\". About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, below the surface.  - Worms are many different distantly related animals that typically have a long cylindrical tube-like body and no limbs. Worms vary in size from microscopic to over in length for marine polychaete worms (bristle worms), for the African giant earthworm, \\"Microchaetus\\", and for the marine nemertean worm (bootlace worm), \\"Lineus longissimus\\". Various types of worm occupy a small variety of parasitic niches, living inside the bodies of other animals. Free-living worm species do not live on land, but instead live in marine or freshwater environments, or underground by burrowing.  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame.

English is the world language of politics and international business. It becomes the international language of science, medicine, sports, travel and so on. In most schools in Asia, English is taught as the main foreign language. School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age. English is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States and Australia. Many different languages are spoken in some countries. However, English is often used as an official language to help people communicate with each other. India is a good example. English is the common language in this country, but at least twenty-four languages are spoken there. Do you know the history of English? Old English took many words from the French language. Most English words came from French, especially those words used for describing the law and the government, such as \\"damage\\",\\" prison \\"and \\" marriage\\". Then, English became what language experts   called Middle English. The history of English continues as Middle English, and then it becomes Modern English, and it is spoken today. ,.

A: Choose your answer from: (1). disruption (2). solution (3). fluid (4). suspension","output":"A heterogeneous mixture of particles of one substance distributed throughout a second substance in a different phase is known as a suspension (4). Suspensions are mixtures that consist of solid particles or liquid droplets large enough to eventually settle under the influence of gravity, without undergoing any chemical changes. These mixtures are characterized by their heterogeneous nature, as the particles are not uniformly distributed in the second substance. The solid particles or liquid droplets in a suspension are generally larger than those in a solution or colloid, leading to their ability to settle over time. In contrast, a solution (2) is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, where one substance, called the solute, dissolves into another substance, known as the solvent. In a solution, the solute and solvent mix together uniformly, forming a consistent mixture with particles at the molecular or ionic level, which cannot be separated by simple mechanical means such as filtration. As for the other options, disruption (1) and fluid (3) are not relevant to the question. Disruption refers to an interruption or disturbance in the normal functioning or continuity of an activity. Fluid is a term describing substances that flow, such as liquids and gases, rather than being a term to describe a heterogeneous mixture of particles.

Movie title: Mother and Son Context: \\"Mother and Son\\" (1997) is a love story, not of the \\"Romeo and Juliette\\" or \\"Tristan and Isolde\\" type, but rather regarding the profound emotional ties that exist between a mother and her son. The film calls for amazing optical effects and sounds in order to develop a cinematographic poetry. \\"Mother and Son\\" is the first part of a trilogy that has for its subject matter the study of the drama in human relationships. It is followed by \\"Father and Son\\" (2003), and by \\"Two Brothers and a Sister,\\" the final installment, which is in its preliminary filming stage.The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail, old woman. They recline in a silence penetrated only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted, sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey, from her sick-bed to her death-bed. It is a circular motion, which travels a long walk through a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous ski of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the worldThey return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed, which now seems to resemble a coffin. Both know that the end is nearing, although he tries to reassure...

It is important to be honest with your child, particularly if they are autistic, or is wondering about an autistic friend. However, it is also important to make sure that your child is old enough to understand what you are telling her, and will not become confused or overwhelmed. Every child is different, so there's no set age to speak to her. It is up to you as to when you do have the conversation.  If your child is autistic, err on the side of talking about it too soon. It can be stressful to feel like you are different, but no one will tell you why. Young children can hear something as simple as \\"You have a disability called autism, which means your brain works a little differently, and that's why you have therapists to help you.\\" Let them know that autism is a disability, not a disease or a burden, and that it is okay to be autistic. Older children may benefit from being introduced to the concept of neurodiversity and the disability rights movement.   Encourage a child to see the good in an autistic friend, sibling, or classmate. For example, \\"Yes, Lola does have a hard time talking and dealing with big emotions sometimes. I've noticed that she's sweet, and good at art. What do you think Lola is good at?\\" Help your autistic child to understand that their differences make them unique and special. Explain the strengths of autism: strong sense of logic and ethics, compassion, deep passions, focus, loyalty, and desire to help (social responsibility). Make sure you encourage your child, telling them that their autism makes them different but not lesser. Your child can still comfortably take part in school and home activities and lead a happy life. Always tell your child how much you love and care for them. It's important to have proper support, particularly when facing a life with a disability, and with help your child can live a happy, productive life.","output":"Be honest with your autistic child or about an autistic friend while considering their age and understanding, emphasizing the positive aspects and acknowledging it as a disability, not a burden, to ensure a happy and supported life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They begin a sexual relationship. His father disapproves of this and her parents try to stop them from continuing to see each other. She deliberately sets off the fire alarm at school, knowing that there is no fire there, and is subsequently suspended. She has an argument with her parents when they tell her they are sending her to a boarding school. She takes an overdose and her parents subsequently arrange to have her committed. Matt helps Casey escape from an acute psychiatric ward, and as they run away they both deal with her borderline personality disorder. Casey is eccentric in nature. Her impulsiveness and extreme risk-taking attitude and behavior is attributed to her illness, in which she experiences severe highs and lows of emotion.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways -   suppose the bat will not be able to locate where it is happens, how will it affect WEAKER echolocation.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"Directly impacting a step of the process If a bat is unable to locate where it is via echolocation, it suggests there is a malfunction or disruption in the process of echolocation. Echolocation is a step-by-step process, and disturbance to any part of it can impact the overall process. Echolocation works from the point the high-pitched tone is produced by the bat, bounced off an object, and returned to the bat. If anything disrupts this process, the bat’s ability to navigate or hunt for prey is compromised as the information required to determine the location, size, shape, and position of objects or prey is corrupted or incomplete. This is a direct impact on the process.  It is possible that an external factor, such as a loud noise or other related interference, could disrupt the process by mingling with the original high-pitch sound or echo, therefore altering what the bat receives and interprets. This can be viewed as a direct impact because it explicitly interferes with a step in the echolocation process.

Firstly, let's clean up the right side of the equation where we have 21*x + 32 + 112. So, do you remember what we get if we add 32 and 112? That's right, we get 144! Therefore, this makes our equatation: -24 = 21*x + 144 Now for the next step! We want to get rid of the 144 from the right side of the equation. Do you remember what we could do? Yes! We have to subtract 144 from both sides!  The equation now turns into: -24 - 144 = 21*x, or -168 = 21*x Now we need to find the value of x. For that, we need to divide both sides by 21, which will leave x by itself on the right side!  So when we divide -168 by 21, we get -8. So, x = -8.  So the solution to the equation is x = -8!

They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person's eyes naturally focus images behind the retina?  Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Answer:","output":"Kathy's eyes naturally focus images behind the retina, as she is farsighted (hyperopic)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting.  James is driving down the street in his town. For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside.  Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? The answer to this question is:","output":"The vapor light is more energy efficient than a regular incandescent light bulb. Vapor lights, like sodium vapor or mercury vapor lights, have better energy efficiency and a longer lifespan compared to traditional incandescent bulbs. This is because vapor lights use the process of electroluminescence, which generates less heat and requires less energy to produce bright light. In comparison, incandescent light bulbs produce light by heating a filament inside the bulb, which results in significant energy loss in the form of heat. However, it's worth noting that there are other lighting technologies, such as compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), that are even more energy-efficient than vapor lights. These options, especially LEDs, are becoming more popular for street lighting and other applications due to their superior energy efficiency, longer lifespan, and environmental benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why India fails to get medals in Olympics?","output":"While these two questions may initially appear to be expressing the same concern, a closer examination reveals that they possess subtle differences in focus and perspective. It is important to note that both questions revolve around the central subject of India's performance in the Olympics, specifically discussing its inability to secure a significant number of medals. However, the manner in which each question addresses the issue underlines the difference between the two. 1. \\"Why are Indians not getting medals in Olympics?\\" This question pays attention to the individual athletes or teams that represent India and participate in the Olympic Games, specifically wondering why they may not be able to win medals. It highlights the individuals' performance and might invite potential reasons that encompass the athletes' preparation, talent, resources, or competitive spirit. The question implicitly suggests that if one can identify factors affecting Indian athletes, there might be room for improvement, thereby increasing the chances of India acquiring more medals in future competitions. Some potential answers to this question could include: - Lack of proper infrastructure and training facilities for Indian athletes - Insufficient financial support and resources for athletes to prepare at competitive levels - The immense focus on popular sports like cricket, leaving fewer resources and interest in Olympic sports - Cultural factors that might discourage participation in sports or prioritize academic pursuits 2. \\"Why India fails to get medals in Olympics?\\" This question shifts the focus slightly, placing the emphasis on India as a whole and not just on the individual participants. By framing the concern this way, it invites a broader perspective on the country's collective efforts and underlying systems responsible for its overall performance in the Olympic Games. The question implies that there may be structural or systemic challenges, beyond just the performance of the athletes themselves, that contribute to India's failure to secure more medals. Some possible answers to this question could include: - Inadequate sports policies and lack of long-term vision from sports authorities - Limited funding and investment in sports infrastructure and athlete development - A large population diluting the talent pool, making it harder for individuals to rise to the top - Societal attitudes towards specific sports or physical activity, preventing India from exploring the full range of sports disciplines and identifying potential talent In conclusion, while both questions are related to India's performance in the Olympics and its inability to secure more medals, they approach the issue from slightly different perspectives. The first question focuses on the individual athletes or teams and their circumstances, whereas the second question takes a broader look at the country's collective efforts and systemic challenges. Hence, analyzing both questions allows one to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to India's Olympic performance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  and a hint : Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.

While walking home from the hospital one day after visiting his father, he cuts through a vacant lot where he discovers a severed ear buried under overgrown grass and puts it in a paper bag. Jeffrey takes the ear to the police station and speaks to Detective John Williams (George Dickerson) whom he knows as a neighbor.Later that evening, Jeffrey goes to Williams' house to glean further details. He finds the detective evasive about the case and receives a stern warning from Williams not to talk about what he found to anyone because it might jeopardize an ongoing police investigation. Outside the house, Jeffrey meets the detective's daughter, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern).

Write highlights for this article: A 21-day quarantine for all military personnel serving in Ebola stricken areas of West Africa was approved by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Wednesday. The quarantine was pushed for by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Hagel said. Initially the measure will apply to all personnel leaving the West Africa area. But Hagel said the policy will be reviewed within 45 days. The policy creates a separate set of rules for military members than what the White House has pushed for civilian health care workers. President Obama has argued that civilian volunteer health workers returning from aid trips to Africa should not be quarantined and the White House has urged states not to impose their own quarantine policies. Science, Obama has said, does not support the need for a quarantine. Related: Army major general speaks to CNN from inside quarantine. Asked to explain the discrepancy between civilians and the military, he said Tuesday service members have been sent to the Ebola region by him and health workers are going as volunteers. \\"It's part of their mission that's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me, the commander-in-chief,\\" the president told reporters on the White House's South Lawn on Tuesday.\\"So we don't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for civilians,\\" Obama said. \\"They are already, by definition, if they're in the military under more circumscribed conditions.\\" The chiefs did not have new scientific or medical data about Ebola when they pressed for Hagel to approve the quarantine the military official said. \\"This is simply about the chiefs looking at the best way to take care of the force, the families and the communities to which they are returning,\\" a military official told CNN. This effort \\"is an admittedly conservative approach,\\" the official said. In their discussions the chiefs—who each head one of the military services branches—noted that many of the US troops are young and inexperienced in any medical issues. There was concern they might not adhere to an informal protocol of taking their temperature twice a day on their own. Hagel said Wednesday that the families and communities in the US and Europe where the troops are located had also expressed concern. \\"They very much wanted a safety valve on this,\\" Hagel said at an event in Washington. Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said he was \\"encouraged\\" by the new policy. \\"This act will ensure that our service men and women, their families, and our communities have the confidence that every necessary precaution is taken to ensure their health and safety.\\" The US already has 1,000 troops on the ground, and that force could grow to a total of 4,000. \\"That's the biggest group of Americans there,\\" the official said, noting that also was a factor in the chiefs thinking. \\"The chiefs believe it is better to start more restrictive and then re-assess as we get further into the Ebola operation,\\" the official said. For now, troops will be held in quarantine at bases designated by each of the military services. There will be provisions for compassionate leave—allowing troops to leave quarantine if they have a family emergency such as an illness or death. The quarantine will also not apply to those just briefly travelling to Liberia, or aircrews flying in an out, although everyone is told to monitor their temperatures. Related: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he won't change Ebola policy. Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno ordered an Army wide quarantine for soldiers coming back from West Africa, beginning with Major General Darryl Williams and his team. Defense officials had said the quarantine for Williams was ordered because he and his group had traveled extensively around Liberia, although they had no direct contact with Ebola patients. Highlights:","output":"1. The Defense Secretary said that there will be a 21-day quarantine for military people who were in the parts of West Africa where Ebola is a big problem. 2. Right now, the quarantine will only be for people who are leaving West Africa, but they will check on the rules in 45 days. 3. The President thinks that people like doctors and nurses who go to help people with Ebola on their own don't need a quarantine, but he thinks the military does need it because they follow his orders. 4. The leaders of the different parts of the military wanted the quarantine to help keep their soldiers, family, and communities safe. 5.

The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has received multiple reports from consumers who experienced long-lasting and severe side effects from the application of henna for temporary tattoos. Side effects include, but are not limited to, red lesions that are raised and weeping, loss of pigmentation of the skin, blisters, increased sunlight sensitivity, redness, and permanent scarring.  These reactions can occur immediately after getting a temporary tattoo using traditional red henna or \\"black henna.\\" Reactions from temporary henna tattoos can also occur up to two or three weeks after receiving the tattoo. You can also experience adverse side effects from hair dye that contains “black henna.” If you are purchasing henna to use at home on your skin or hair, make sure you examine each ingredient listed on the label. Avoid any color additives in henna dyes to be used on the skin. If you are getting a henna tattoo from a tattoo artist or your hair dyed by a professional, make sure you inquire about the ingredients in the dye they will use on your skin or hair. Ask specifically about the inclusion of p-phenylenediamine, or PPD, and avoid getting a tattoo with this additive. Children can be particularly sensitive to henna. Skin sensitivities and allergic reactions to henna can occur in children.  Children with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are at particular risk, as applying henna to the skin of children with this condition can cause a life-threatening condition called hemolysis. Seek immediate medical attention if a child with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency has been exposed to henna.

However, a pair of cheeky crooks took a far more relaxed  approach when breaking into a residency in China. They plonked themselves on the sofa and flicked on the homeowner's TV, helping themselves to delicious snacks while they were at it. Unfortunately for these foolish home invaders, they were immediately arrested after being spotted on a remote surveillance camera. The man of the house, 32-year-old Chung Chang, was at work when he randomly decided to check his security gear on account of a 'sixth-sense'. He watched absolutely stunned as two men casually wandered around his living room in the city of Linyi in eastern China's Shandong province, enjoying all the facilities on offer. The nerve of them! A pair of burglars sat on the sofa to snack and watch TV while invading a residency in China. 'When I saw these two men in my flat I was very confused,' Chung says.

Emily was given the grand estate by her late grandparents, and even though she loved the house itself, she couldn't help but feel the pang of loneliness within its walls. Emily walked through the grand halls of the estate, which now seemed so empty. The echoing sound of her footsteps came as a stark reminder of the vastness around her. The house had a rich history that Emily wished to preserve, but she was unable to shake the notion that the manor's current state was a mere shell of its once lively self. Lost in thought, Emily found herself in the carefully curated art gallery her grandparents had so passionately put together. Her eyes darted to each piece, taking in the stories each of them told. It was then that an idea came to her, as if whispered by the very walls that now felt so empty. She would bring life back into the estate by turning it into a hotel and art gallery. Every guest would receive a guided tour of the incredible artwork, and the mansion would be home to lectures, live artists, and social gatherings - a thriving cultural hub that would celebrate the magnificent beauty of both the art and the estate. In the following weeks, Emily began compiling a list of reputable professionals, influencers, and creators who could help her bring her vision to life. Architects, interior designers, art professors, and even marketing strategists were welcomed into the estate to discuss the transformation that lay ahead. As the project gained momentum, a fresh sense of life seemed to breathe into the manor. Each day brought forth new ideas and changes, and the workers' chatter filled the once quiet spaces. Colorful fabric replaced the dust covers, and fragrant flowers adorned the halls. The barren walls now boasted stunning murals that paid homage to the estate's rich history and showcased the abundance of talent Emily had gathered. Emily dedicated herself to work tirelessly on the new venture, creating online profiles, networking with potential partners, and reaching out to her grandparents' previous connections in the art world. Eventually, word of her exciting project began to spread amongst the elite and her online presence grew. With each passing day, Emily watched the estate transform. Rooms that were once empty were now meticulously curated art spaces, each with their own theme - from Renaissance masters to innovative contemporary artists. Luxurious suites welcomed visitors with unparalleled comfort and warmth, all within a beautifully rich, artistic setting that further elevated the experience. Finally, the grand opening day arrived; the halls buzzed with excitement as an array of international connoisseurs, celebrated artists, and curious tourists graced the estate. As Emily guided them through the various art exhibits, she could sense the joy that her project brought to others. As the night settled, Emily found herself standing on her estate's balcony with a cup of tea in hand. The melodious sounds of laughter and clinking glasses floated through the air. She couldn't help but smile as she realized that, not only had she fulfilled her grandparents' legacy, but she had also created something truly unique that would bring joy to countless others in the years to come. Emily's determination, passion, and love for the art brought life back to the estate that once seemed so desolate. The echoes of her footfalls were now replaced with the sound of conversations, art, and life – a testament to the power of creativity and the strength of one visionary woman, who managed to combine her love for her family's heritage with her innate desire to forge her own path."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk.

He labeled that study as case A. To compare that to other areas he visited Arizona. There he didn't see any occurrence of hypoxia. He labeled that case as case B.  Which case would less likely see formation of toxic compounds, case A or case B?  Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","output":"Case B would be less likely to see the formation of toxic compounds. This is because hypoxia is not observed in Arizona, unlike in the Mississippi delta (case A).

With RB Larry Johnson out with an injury, RB Priest Holmes would be making his first start in more than two seasons. In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Broncos kicker Jason Elam managed to get a 44-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Chiefs managed to tie the game with kicker Dave Rayner getting a 38-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Kansas City took the lead with Safety Bernard Pollard blocking a punt from deep within Denver territory.  The ball would roll the back of the endzone for a safety.  However, the Broncos went back into the lead with Elam getting a 50-yard field goal.  The Chiefs would take the halftime lead as Rayner kicked a 36-yard field goal. In the third quarter, K.C. trailed big as Denver RB Selvin Young got a 20-yard TD pass, while LB Nate Webster returned a fumble 17&#160;yards for a touchdown.  Even worse, starting-QB Damon Huard would leave the game on that play due to a concussion.  Back-up QB Brodie Croyle took over the Chiefs offense for the remainder of the game.  Later in the period, K.C. tried to rally as Rayner nailed a 39-yard field goal.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Broncos sealed the win with QB Jay Cutler completing an 18-yard TD pass to TE Daniel Graham. With the loss, not only did the Chiefs fall to 4-5, but it ended their 8-game home winning streak against division opponents. Priest Holmes, in his first start in over two years, ran 20 times for 65 yards, along with catching 2 passes for 14 yards. How many yards longer was Dave Rayner's second field goal compared to his first?","output":"Dave Rayner's first field goal was 38 yards and his second field goal was 36 yards. To find the difference in yardage between the two field goals, subtract the shorter field goal distance from the longer one: 38 - 36 = 2 yards. So, Dave Rayner's second field goal was 2 yards shorter compared to his first field goal, not longer."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was said to have \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers?\\" from the following article ?  The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

Context: Zoos are not my favorite places. I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

However, the hypothesis you propose doesn't necessarily follow from this premise. The hypothesis is changing the food type to fresh greens and ranch dressing and it opposes the initial premise by suggesting that one should keep watching their weight. That is somewhat contradictory to the original premise which requested an abandonment of weight concerns. The core idea in the premise is about indulgence in the seasonally offered food, specifically fresh strawberries and cream, without concerning about the dietary constrains or weight. It illustrates a context of permissible self-pampering, persuading to momentarily forget about any weight-related worries.  On the contrary, your hypothesis promotes a consciousness about one's weight, advocating for a healthy choice of fresh greens and ranch dressing, which is traditionally considered as a healthier option. This concept essentially varies greatly from the 'indulgence without guilt' theme observed in the premise.  In addition, the proposed hypothesis also changes the type of food specified in the premise. Therefore, it neither logically flows from the initial premise nor remains consistent with the suggested idea.It is not a falsified suggestion, rather a different perspective promoting health consciousness. Therefore, whilst your hypothesis could stand as a valid suggestion for someone seeking to maintain their weight, it does not logically follow or derive from the given premise directly. A more accurate conclusion from the original premise would be something along the lines of, \\"When the season arrives, free yourself from weight concerns and relish the island's range of fresh fruit and cream dishes offered by its many restaurants and cafes.\\""},{"instruction":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid killwithme but, as Marsh feared, this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his various victims include a helicopter pilot (who is bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt by heat lamps) and Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged).At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is not the case. The first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable, techno-prodigy son, Owen Reilly, broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to prove a point (that the public is insatiable for the suffering of others), as well as wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's tragedy.

Q: What are the pores in plants that keep certain gases and liquids in and out called?   A: Answer:","output":"The pores in plants that regulate the exchange of gases and liquids, allowing the uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and release of oxygen, water vapor, and other gases, are known as stomata (singular: stoma). Stomata play a critical role in plant physiology, ensuring that the plant receives necessary resources, maintains a balanced water potential, and effectively carries out various physiological processes. These tiny adjustable pores are predominantly found on the surface of leaves, specifically the epidermis, and occasionally on stems and other organs. Structurally, each stoma is surrounded by two specialized parenchyma cells, called guard cells, which are responsible for controlling the opening and closing of the stoma. The size and distribution of stomata vary among different plant species, allowing for efficient gas exchange and water management depending on the specific environment and plant requirements. In general, stomata open during the day to allow for carbon dioxide uptake and close during the night to reduce water loss. However, some plants native to arid regions, such as cacti, have adapted to open their stomata during cooler nights to minimize water loss. In addition to photosynthesis, stomata are crucial for a process called transpiration. Transpiration refers to the loss of water vapor from the plant's aerial parts, such as leaves and stems, to the atmosphere. When stomata open for gas exchange, water vapor can also escape the leaf, helping the plant to maintain an optimal temperature and balance its water supply. Additionally, transpiration creates a pulling force that aids in the uptake of water and dissolved nutrients from the soil through the plant's root system, ultimately facilitating their transport to the various plant organs. The opening and closing of stomata are controlled by various factors, including environmental conditions, internal signals, and the guard cells' turgidity. Some key factors influencing stomatal movement are: 1. Light: Stomata usually open in the presence of light, as photosynthesis occurs during daylight hours and requires a continuous supply of carbon dioxide. 2. Carbon dioxide concentration: Changes in the internal carbon dioxide concentration signal the stomata to open or close based on the plant's photosynthetic and respiratory needs. 3. Humidity: High external humidity promotes stomatal opening, whereas low humidity causes stomata to close, helping the plant conserve water. 4. Temperature: Elevated temperatures can cause stomata to open, increasing transpiration and evaporation rates for optimal temperature regulation. However, this response can vary among plant species and differs in extreme temperature conditions. 5. Hormones and signaling molecules: Hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) can trigger stomatal closure under stress conditions, such as drought, to prevent excessive water loss. In summary, stomata are crucial structures in plants that regulate the exchange of gases and liquids, ensuring optimal functioning of essential processes like photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration. Controlled by both environmental and internal factors, stomata help plants maintain their overall health and adapt to changing conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or hydraulic pressure. Instead every machine could be equipped with its own electric motor, providing easy control at the point of use, and improving power transmission efficiency. Electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water. Household uses of electric motors reduced heavy labor in the home and made higher standards of convenience, comfort and safety possible. Today, electric motors stand for more than half of the electric energy consumption in the US. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): In what domain did electric motors reduce reliance on humans and animals?","output":"Electric motors have significantly reduced the reliance on human and animal labor in various domains. One notable domain where electric motors have made a huge impact is the agricultural industry. Before the advent of electric motors, most of the labor-intensive tasks in agriculture, such as plowing, harvesting, handling grain, and pumping water, were accomplished through human and animal muscle power. With the introduction of electric motors, these tasks have become more efficient and less reliant on manual efforts. Another important domain where electric motors have replaced human and animal labor is the industrial sector. Thanks to electric motors, industrial processes are no longer limited by power transmission using old-fashioned methods like line shafts, belts, compressed air, or hydraulic pressure. Electric motors have made it possible to equip every machine with its own power source, enabling better control, increased operational efficiency, and enhanced productivity. In addition to these major domains, electric motors have also revolutionized household tasks, leading to significant labor reduction. With household appliances like washing machines, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, and food processors, powered by electric motors, everyday chores that once required a substantial amount of manual labor have been made much simpler and quicker. In conclusion, electric motors have played a crucial role in reducing reliance on humans and animals in various domains, with agriculture and industry being the most significant examples. The widespread application of electric motors continues to provide higher standards of convenience, comfort, and safety across multiple sectors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers. Now answer this question: What Bohemian movement was influenced by Wycliffe?","output":"The Bohemian movement that was influenced by Wycliffe was Hussitism. This is stated in the given paragraph, which says \\"Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia.\\" The paragraph positions Wycliffe's theological views as precursors to both these movements, which emerged as significant heretical deviations according to the Western Church.

I think it would appeal to any Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own. And I feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I won't spoil it for you. The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie. The story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a falling star Tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with. He is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too. Three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again, and some bickering princes. It's a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. It's charming and I feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages. It's simply magical. It's a true classic fairy tale, the likes of which I haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s.

Article: John wanted John de Gray, the Bishop of Norwich and one of his own supporters, to be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury after the death of Walter, but the cathedral chapter for Canterbury Cathedral claimed the exclusive right to elect Walter's successor. They favoured Reginald, the chapter's sub-prior. To complicate matters, the bishops of the province of Canterbury also claimed the right to appoint the next archbishop. The chapter secretly elected Reginald and he travelled to Rome to be confirmed; the bishops challenged the appointment and the matter was taken before Innocent. John forced the Canterbury chapter to change their support to John de Gray, and a messenger was sent to Rome to inform the papacy of the new decision. Innocent disavowed both Reginald and John de Gray, and instead appointed his own candidate, Stephen Langton. John refused Innocent's request that he consent to Langton's appointment, but the pope consecrated Langton anyway in June 1207.

Brett Favre was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, the son of Bonita Ann (nee French) and Irvin Ernest Favre, and raised in the small town of Kiln. Both of his parents were schoolteachers in the Hancock County School District. He is of part French ancestry. One of his ancestors is Simon Favre, a Creole, was an influential figure in Spanish West Florida in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; Brett descends from Simon's Choctaw Native American mistress, Pistikiokonay, and thus his grandfather was affiliated with the Choctaw. In the second game of the 1992 season, the Packers played the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers were leading 17-0 at halftime when head coach Mike Holmgren benched starting quarterback Don Majkowski and Favre played the second half. On his first regular season play as a Packer, Favre threw a pass that was deflected by Buccaneers player Ray Seals and caught by Favre. Favre was tackled and the completion went for -7 yards. The Packers lost the game 31-3, chalking up only 106 yards passing.  In the third game of the 1992 season, Majkowski injured a ligament in his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals, an injury severe enough that he would be out for four weeks. Favre replaced Majkowski for the remainder of the game. Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game, a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, Ty Detmer. However, down 23-17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8-yard line. Favre then completed a 42-yard pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. Three plays later, Favre threw the game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Kitrick Taylor with 13 seconds remaining.  The next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers began the longest consecutive starts streak for a quarterback in NFL history. The game ended in a 17-3 victory and his passer rating was 144.6. During the season, Favre helped put together a six-game winning streak for the Packers, the longest winning streak for the club since 1965. They ended 9-7 that season, missing the playoffs on their last game. Favre finished his first season as a Packer with 3,227 yards and a quarterback rating of 85.3, helping him to his first Pro Bowl.  The following season, Favre helped the Packers to their first playoff berth since 1982 and was named to his second Pro Bowl. Favre had his first career 400 yard passing game and led the NFC in pass attempts, pass completions, and pass interceptions. Favre also had four game winning drives giving him seven for his career up to that point. After the season, Favre became a free agent. General manager Ron Wolf negotiated Favre into a five-year, 19 million contract.  The Packers finished the 1994 season with a 9-7 record, advancing to the playoffs in back to back years, a feat they had not accomplished since the Vince Lombardi era. For the first time in his career, he was not eligible for the Pro Bowl. Entity:","output":"This text is about Brett Favre.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Loch Tay (Scottish Gaelic, \\"Loch Tatha\\") is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.  - In common law systems, land tenure is the legal regime in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to \\"hold\\" the land. The French verb \\"tenir\\" means \\"to hold\\" and \\"tenant\\" is the present participle of \\"tenir\\". The sovereign monarch, known as The Crown, held land in its own right. All private owners are either its tenants or sub-tenants. \\"Tenure\\" signifies the relationship between tenant and lord, not the relationship between tenant and land.  - Crofting is a form of land tenure and small-scale food production particular to the Scottish Highlands, the islands of Scotland, and formerly on the Isle of Man. Within the 19th century townships, individual crofts are established on the better land, and a large area of poorer-quality hill ground is shared by all the crofters of the township for grazing of their livestock.  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - Perth and Kinross is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland and a Lieutenancy Area. It borders onto the Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Fife, Highland and Stirling council areas. Perth is the administrative centre. The council boundaries correspond broadly, but not exactly, with the former counties of Perthshire and Kinross-shire.  - Fearnan ( Gaelic Feàrnan , ' Alders ' ) is a small crofting village on the north shore of Loch Tay in Perthshire , Scotland . The village lies at the junction of the road to Glen Lyon and the road between Kenmore and Killin that runs along the north side of the loch . The land around the village has at various times in history belonged to both the Robertsons of Struan and the Campbells . The village is now a mix of old crofts dating back up to 400 years and new builds mainly from the 1980s . There is also a whole hidden village of crofts with just their foundations left , just below the forestry of Drummond Hill . Visitors who wish to explore the area are encouraged to park at the village hall and walk up the field opposite , clamber over the wall and walk right , where there is a road covered in fern , then walk up the hill , and with a bit of searching they will find the remnants of the houses . The village 's only hotel , the Tigh - an - Loan , went out of business in 2008 and the building was demolished a year later . Up to the early 1970s , this loch - side hotel also ran a small garage / filling station plus the village post office . The latter moved to a new building just east of the junction for Fortingall but even that closed in 2001 and now the nearest shops are in Kenmore , 3.5 miles away . Along with several other village schools around Loch Tay , the one class village primary school ( where Kate Maynard was the last teacher ) closed in 1983 when a new comprehensive primary school opened in the grounds of Taymouth Castle in Kenmore . Secondary school pupils have always had to travel to Aberfeldy ( 10 miles from Fearnan ) and that situation continues today . Across the road from the former school building lies the remains of Fearnan Pier , one of five intermediate piers served until 1946 by the Caledonian ( later LMS ) Railway 's steamers plying from Killin to Kenmore and back . At the top of the road leading up from the lochside , 20 metres past Quarry Road ( a single lane road accessing the top...  - Perthshire, officially the County of Perth, is a registration county in central Scotland. It extends from Strathmore in the east, to the Pass of Drumochter in the north, Rannoch Moor and Ben Lui in the west, and Aberfoyle in the south. It was a local government county from 1890 to 1930.  - Ben Lui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Laoigh) is a mountain in the southern Highlands of Scotland, at the head of Glen Fyne. It has five well-defined ridges radiating out from the summit. Four corries lie between the ridges; including Coire Gaothaich which lies on the northeast side of the mountain.  - The Pass of Drumochter is the main mountain pass between the northern and southern central Scottish Highlands. The A9 road passes through here, as does the Highland Main Line, the railway between Inverness and the south of Scotland. The Sustrans National Cycle Route 7 between Glasgow and Inverness also runs through the pass.  - Rannoch Moor (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Mòinteach Raineach/Raithneach\\") is an expanse of around 50 square miles (130 km²) of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, where it extends from and into westerly Perth and Kinross, northerly Lochaber (in Highland), and the area of Highland Scotland toward its south-west, northern Argyll and Bute. Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Highlands (\\"the place of the Gaels\\") are a historic region of Scotland. The region became culturally distinguishable from the Lowlands from the later Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of \\"A' Ghàidhealtachd\\" literally means \\"the place of the Gaels\\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands.  - Loch is the Irish and Scottish Gaelic word for a lake or for a sea inlet. It is cognate with the Manx lough, Cornish logh, and the Welsh word for lake, llyn.  - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics.

Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to.

Ex-IAAF anti-doping director Gabriel Dolle has been banned for five years. IAAF president Lord Coe said the bans \\"could not send a stronger message\\". Diack and Balakhnichev, a former president of the Russian athletics federation and IAAF treasurer, face fines of £17,000 while Russian coach Melnikov could be fined £10,000. The independent IAAF ethics commission panel's 170-page report claims Diack, Balakhnichev and Melnikov conspired to \\"blackmail\\" Shobukhova to cover up her doping violations by her paying them \\"bribes\\" of about £435,000. Last month, Diack told the BBC he \\"totally rejects\\" the blackmail allegations, saying: \\"There was no extortion of funds from any athlete.\\" The panel said: \\"The head of a national federation, the senior coach of a major national team and a marketing consultant for the IAAF conspired together (and, it may yet be proven with others too) to conceal for more than three years' anti-doping violations by an athlete at what appeared to be the highest pinnacle of her sport. \\"They acted dishonestly and corruptly and did unprecedented damage to the sport of track and field which, by their actions, they have brought into serious disrepute.\\" Shobukhova's 38-month ban from track and field was reduced by seven months after she turned whistleblower for the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Russia have been banned from international athletics competition after a report by Wada's independent commission alleged the country was guilty of \\"state-sponsored doping\\". BBC Sport's Matt Slater There is an old rule of journalism that you should always get the name of the dog in any story about a domestic tragedy or natural disaster - the idea being it is the pet with a cute name that really grabs your audience. There should be an amendment to that rule for this golden age of sporting scandal: get the name of the dodgy bank account. In the case of the scam to suppress positive drug tests by Russian athletes in return for cash, it is called 'Black Tidings'. How apt for a grim tale that involves drugs, mysterious meetings, blackmail, a cosmopolitan cast of pantomime villains and the Olympics. The weirdest thing about reading the 170-page into how the IAAF president's son and two leading Russian officials colluded to extract huge sums of money from a drugs cheat - while Dolle, the IAAF's anti-doping boss, looked at his finger nails and whistled - is you almost feel sorry for the cheat.

Here are possible answers to this question: - fan - energy - vacuuming - mop - broom  I believe the correct choice is \\"mop\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"mop. Here's why: Wet cleaning a floor, also known as mopping, is a process that involves using a cleaning solution with water to remove dirt, grime, and stains from various flooring surfaces such as tile, linoleum, and hardwood. When performing wet cleaning or mopping, having the proper tools and equipment is essential to achieving a clean, sanitary, and presentable floor. Among the given choices, the correct tool for wet cleaning is a mop. Allow me to explain the reasons behind this choice and provide an overview of why other options are not suitable for this particular task. 1. Mop: A mop is a cleaning tool specifically designed for wet cleaning floors. It has a long handle and a cleaning head with absorbent material, such as microfiber, cotton, or sponge, which readily soaks up water and cleaning solution, making it the perfect tool for wet cleaning. When you navigate the mop across the floor, with the right amount of pressure and movement, dirt and grime are efficiently lifted and absorbed by the mop head, leaving the floor clean and fresh. 2. Fan: A fan is used to create airflow and circulate air within a room, typically used for ventilation or cooling purposes. While a fan might help to dry the floor after it has been wet cleaned, it would not effectively assist in the actual cleaning process. Therefore, a fan is not the correct choice for wet cleaning a floor. 3. Energy: Energy is the capacity to perform work or complete tasks, and it is a required resource for any activity, including housework or wet cleaning. Although important, energy alone cannot accomplish the task of wet cleaning a floor. Having the physical energy to clean is necessary; however, it does not replace the need for a proper cleaning tool such as a mop. 4. Vacuuming: Vacuuming is a method of dry cleaning floors and carpets, which entails using a vacuum cleaner to remove dirt, dust, and debris from surfaces. A vacuum cleaner uses suction to pick up dirt and is designed primarily for use on carpets or rugs; it is not created for wet cleaning purposes. Therefore, using a vacuum cleaner to wet clean a floor is not appropriate or efficient. 5. Broom: A broom is another tool used for cleaning floors, but it is exclusively designed for dry cleaning or sweeping dust and debris. Brooms consist of a long handle and stiff bristles that enable you to push dirt from one area to another, which is helpful for gathering debris before disposing of it. Brooms are not suitable for wet cleaning, as their bristles are not designed to absorb water or a cleaning solution and will not adequately clean grime or stains from the floor. In conclusion, a mop is the correct choice for wet cleaning a floor while doing housework, due to its design and ability to absorb water mixed with a cleaning solution. Using a mop ensures that the floor is thoroughly cleaned, sanitized, and left looking presentable. Other options, such as a fan, energy, vacuuming, and broom, either provide no actual assistance in the cleaning process or are not designed for wet cleaning tasks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. panic  B. debate  C. having fun  D. debt  E. peace Answer:","output":"When most people go on vacation, the aim is usually to have fun, relax, and generate positive experiences. So the most suitable answer is option C, \\"having fun\\". For most individuals, taking a vacation is an opportunity to get away from their regular duties and environments. They seek to explore new places, experience new cuisines, engage in leisure activities, and indulge in things they love to do, which is essentially to have fun. Fun, in this context, comes in different shapes and perspectives for everyone. For some, having fun might mean lying on a beach under a tropical sun, reading a book, or simply enjoying the serenity. For others, it could mean exploring an unfamiliar city, trying new adventurous sports, learning about a new culture, or even going on a shopping spree. Then there are those who go on holidays to spend quality and joyful time with their families and friends. They may plan activities that they all can enjoy together, such as camping, hiking, picnicking, visiting amusement parks or museums, etc. Moreover, vacation is also a time when people can pursue their hobbies and passions which they otherwise cannot due to their busy daily schedules. For instance, wildlife enthusiasts may plan a trip to wildlife sanctuaries to photograph the animals in their natural habitats; food lovers may go on a culinary tour to try out different authentic dishes; music and dance lovers might attend a music festival or a dance workshop, and much more. Additionally, having fun on vacation also means having a break from stress and rejuvenating oneself, both physically and mentally. It’s a time to create enjoyable and memorable moments that can keep one refreshed long after the vacation is over. Hence, when people go on vacations, they are looking forward to having fun and taking a respite from the daily grind of life, which implies they want to create an environment of enjoyment and pleasure for themselves. Therefore, out of the given options, option C. \\"having fun\\" suits best in answering what most people are trying to do when going on vacation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - burn - changes color with seasons - turn brown - continue to grow - eat water  Explain why a human would choose \\"continue to grow\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"continue to grow\\" as the answer to the question because: Step 1: Identifying key information in the question The question provides information about grass receiving both water and light, which are two essential components for plant growth. Step 2: Examining the optional answers Option 1: Burn - Water helps hydrate the grass and maintains its health, while light provides the energy for the grass to grow through photosynthesis. This combination does not create a burning effect on the grass. Option 2: Changes color with seasons - While some plants change color with seasons, it is not predominantly due to the presence of water and light. Option 3: Turn brown - Grass turns brown when it lacks enough water or nutrients. As the question states it receives sufficient water, this answer is unlikely. Option 4: Continue to grow - With an ample supply of water and light, grass can photosynthesis and absorb nutrients from the soil, resulting in growth. This answer seems the most plausible. Option 5: Eat water - Grass does not \\"eat\\" water. Plants absorb water through their roots and utilize it for growth, but they do not consume it as food.

Stoke will assess the condition of forward Mame Biram Diouf ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Leicester at the Britannia Stadium. Since scoring the Potters' winner in their shock victory at Manchester City on August 30, Diouf has been away on international duty with Senegal and had not been back in training with his club by Friday. Stoke's Mame Biram Diouf scored a shock winner for Stoke in their 1-0 victory at Manchester City. Winger Oussama Assaidi is in contention to make his 'second debut' after rejoining the Staffordshire outfit on another season-long loan deal from Liverpool on transfer deadline day.

Leicester. A trio of new signings come into the reckoning for Leicester manager Nigel Pearson ahead of his side's Barclays Premier League clash with Stoke on Saturday. Defender Danny Simpson, along with strikers Tom Lawrence and Nick Powell - the latter on loan from Manchester United - are added to the squad for the game at the Britannia Stadium. Promising youngster Tom Lawrence has arrived at Leicester from Manchester United on a permanent basis. Defender Matthew Upson (foot) remains sidelined, and although Matty James is training again after a lay-off with a shin injury, the game comes too soon for the midfielder. Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Schlupp, Moore, Morgan, King, Hammond, Albrighton, Knockaert, Mahrez, Vardy, Taylor-Fletcher, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood, Drinkwater, Cambiasso, Simpson, Powell, Lawrence. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) The Potters are unbeaten in five home meetings with Leicester in all competitions (W4 D1). Indeed, none of the last 10 clashes between the Potters and the Foxes have been won by the away side (six home wins, four draws). Leicester City are without a clean sheet in 11 Premier League games; the longest run of any current top-flight side. Since the start of last season, only Chelsea (2) and Liverpool (5) have scored more than once against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke are unbeaten in their last five home meetings with Leicester, not losing since James Scowcroft scored the only goal for the Foxes in an August 2002 second tier clash. The Potters, who lost 1-0 to Aston Villa on the opening day, have not lost consecutive home league games since April 2013. Nigel Pearson’s side have scored in 33 of their last 34 league games, failing only to net against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Indeed, that 2-0 defeat at Chelsea was Leicester’s first away defeat this calendar year (W8 D4). The Foxes have blocked 25 opposition shots so far this season; at least 10 more than any other team in the Premier League. Stoke are the only Premier League side yet to net in the first-half in 2014-15. Leicester new boy Nick Powell currently has the best min/goal ratio of any player in Premier League history, having scored once in 29 minutes of top-flight football. Highlights:","output":"This weekend, Stoke City and Leicester City are going to play a big soccer game. This is important because both teams have good players and it will be exciting to see who wins. Stoke City has some players who might be a little tired because they played in other games recently, while Leicester City has some new players who are ready to play.

[step] Plantain plants have many different parts, including the leaves, roots, tough, fibrous shoots and flowering seed stalks. For most recipes, it will be easiest to work with just the leaves. <sep> (A) [substeps] To separate plantain leaves from the rest of the plant, pull the plant's leaves from the plant at least 3 to 4 times a week by removing small pits or cavities. The pit will be directly beneath the leaves. (B) Some recipes are carbohydrates, which make plantain leaves slightly sticky when they're scooped out of the jar or into a bowl.

Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\".  - CBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting System) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation. The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City (at the CBS Broadcast Center) and Los Angeles (at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center).  - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.  - Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles.  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records.  - The American folk-music revival was a phenomenon in the United States that began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. Its roots went earlier, and performers like Josh White, Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy, Richard Dyer-Bennet, Oscar Brand, Jean Ritchie, John Jacob Niles, Susan Reed, Paul Robeson and Cisco Houston had enjoyed a limited general popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. The revival brought forward styles of American folk music that had, in earlier times, contributed to the development of country and western, jazz, and rock and roll music.  - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components  electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services. These make Sony one of the most comprehensive entertainment companies in the world. Sony's principal business operations include Sony Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Mobile (formerly Sony Ericsson) and Sony Financial. Sony is among the Semiconductor sales leaders by year and as of 2013, the fourth-largest television manufacturer in the world, after Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and TCL.  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in the summer of 1962. It was first recorded in Columbia Records' Studio A on December 6, 1962 for his second album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". The lyrical structure is based on the question and answer form of traditional ballads such as Lord Randall. Dylan has stated that all of the lyrics were taken from the initial lines of songs that \\"he thought he would never have time to write.\\"  - Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music.  - Highway 61 Revisited is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It was released on August 30, 1965, by Columbia Records. Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing 11-minute ballad, \\"Desolation Row\\". Critics have focused on the innovative way in which Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that in an important sense the 1960s \\"started\\" with this album.  - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content.  - A protest song is a song that is associated with a movement for social change and hence part of the broader category of \\"topical\\" songs (or songs connected to current events). It may be folk, classical, or commercial in genre.  - RCA Records is an American major record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME). It is one of SME's flagship record labels alongside sister labels Columbia Records and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, R&B, blues, jazz, and country. The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in U.S. history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada. It was one of only two Canadian record companies to survive the Great Depression.  - \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1962 and released as a single and on his album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" in 1963. Although it has been described as a protest song, it poses a series of rhetorical questions about peace, war and freedom. The refrain \\"The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\\" has been described as \\"impenetrably ambiguous: either the answer is so obvious it is right in your face, or the answer is as intangible as the wind\\".  - A subsidiary, subsidiary company or daughter company is a company that is owned or controlled by another company, which is called the \\"parent company\\", \\"parent\\", or \\"holding company\\". The subsidiary can be a company, corporation, or limited liability company. In some cases it is a government or state-owned enterprise.  - \`\` Gates of Eden '' is a song by Bob Dylan that appears on his fifth studio album Bringing It All Back Home , released on March 22 , 1965 by Columbia Records . It was also released as a single as the B - side of \`\` Like a Rolling Stone '' . Dylan plays the song solo , accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica . It is one of his more surreal songs . In a 2005 Mojo magazine poll of its writers and various well - known musicians , \`\` Gates of Eden '' was ranked 69th among Dylan 's 100 greatest songs .  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - EMI (officially EMI Group Limited, originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries and often known as EMI Records and EMI Music) was a British multinational conglomerate founded in March 1931 and was based in London. At the time of its break-up in 2012, it was the fourth-largest business group and family of record labels in the recording industry and was one of the big four record companies (now the big three). Its EMI Records Ltd. group of record labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records and Capitol Records. EMI also had a major publishing arm, EMI Music Publishingalso based in London with offices globally.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - American folk music is a musical term that encompasses numerous genres, many of which are known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and can sometimes be traced back to such places of origin as Great Britain, Europe, or Africa. Mike Seeger once famously commented that the definition of American folk music is \\"All the music that fits between the cracks.\\"  - Epic Records is an American record company. A division of Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., Epic was founded predominantly as a jazz and classical music label in 1953. It later expanded its scope to include diverse musical genres including pop, R&B, rock and hip hop. Historically, the label has housed popular acts such as Boston, Celine Dion, Dave Clark Five, Gloria Estefan, Pearl Jam, Shakira, and Sly & the Family Stone.  - Bringing It All Back Home is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on March 22, 1965 by Columbia Records. The album is divided into an electric and an acoustic side, although the acoustic side included some tracks in which other instruments were backing up Dylan and his guitar, but no drums were used. On side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll banda move that further alienated him from some of his former peers in the folk music community. Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\"), as his lyrics continued their trend towards the abstract and personal.  - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (  --negative  --positive).","output":"Title: Shattered Expectations: A Negative Take on \\"Paradise Skies\\" As a compassionate film enthusiast, it pains me to dig into a movie with a critical scalpel. But \\"Paradise Skies,\\" a much-anticipated drama written by the up-and-coming director Roger Macinroe, is a glaring exception. When audiences flocked to the theaters, hoping to witness a masterpiece in the making, \\"Paradise Skies\\" instead left us in a shambles of disappointment and unfulfilled promises. The premise of the film centered around a once-prosperous family spiraling into turmoil in their tropical paradise mansion. This enticing concept was prime material for exploring family dynamics, introspection, and human struggles. However, as opposed to a compelling family drama, \\"Paradise Skies\\" proved to be little more than an exhaustive collection of clichés and melodramatic moments. The first issue was the amateurish screenplay. While Macinroe may be an accomplished director, his writing skills left much to be desired. The dialogue often felt forced and unnatural, awkwardly punctuated with dramatic pauses and unnecessary outbursts. Many of the lines seemed to be ripped from the pages of an aspiring teenage screenwriter, failing to bring depth to the characters they were meant to represent. The portrayal of the family's relationships felt almost like a parody, brimming with sweeping generalizations and a misguided vision of what family intricacies should be. As the film progressed, the characters became increasingly two-dimensional, each defined by a single trait that informed their actions and behaviors throughout the film. The film further suffered due to lackluster acting. With such a star-studded cast, one would expect the characters to come alive despite the subpar script. Sadly, their performances only contributed to the movie's downfall. The actors seemed disengaged, as though their hearts were not truly invested in their respective roles. It felt as though the actors were phoning in their performances, which failed to evoke any emotional response from the audience. Additionally, the film's pacing was volatile, bouncing between sluggish scenes and rapid-fire sequences that left viewers disoriented. This created a disjointed narrative and stifled the storyline's momentum. As the story lurched forward, vital plot points were glazed over, leaving viewers struggling to piece them together with minimal information. Visually, \\"Paradise Skies\\" was striking, boasting lush cinematography that was only a saving grace on the surface. But when paired with its nonsensical plot and predictability, the movie's aesthetic beauty quickly lost its enchantment. The result was a hollow and superficial attempt to curry favor with the audience as it flailed and lost its way. Moreover, serious topics like addiction, mental health issues, and societal expectations were brought up throughout the film but reduced to plot devices and unceremoniously discarded when no longer convenient. This careless handling of sensitive issues felt like a lost opportunity that could have brought depth to the otherwise cardboard characters. \\"Paradise Skies\\" could have been a groundbreaking exploration of human emotions and relationships, but due to its flawed script, disinterested acting, and poor handling of serious topics, it fails on almost every level. It is a disheartening example of squandered potential, as audiences will walk away unsatisfied, lamenting the wasted opportunity to create something truly extraordinary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The builders destroyed the warehouse with explosives. Available options: - unacceptable - acceptable","output":"A linguist would find the following sentence to be an acceptable English sentence grammatically. \\"The builders destroyed the warehouse with explosives.\\" In this sentence, we can observe several grammatical elements that make the sentence perfectly valid in terms of English grammar. Let's break down the sentence and analyze these elements: 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence is \\"the builders.\\" This noun phrase consists of a definite article \\"the\\" and a plural noun \\"builders.\\" It clearly defines who or what the sentence is talking about. In this case, it is talking about a specific group of people who destroyed the warehouse. 2. Verb: The verb in the sentence, \\"destroyed,\\" is a transitive past-tense verb that indicates an action was performed by the subject (the builders). A transitive verb requires a direct object, which in this sentence is \\"the warehouse,\\" to complete its meaning. This verb properly agrees with the subject in terms of tense and number. 3. Direct object: The direct object of the sentence is \\"the warehouse.\\" Similar to the subject, this noun phrase consists of a definite article \\"the\\" and a singular noun \\"warehouse.\\" It receives the action of the verb (being destroyed) and provides more information about what action the subject took. 4. Prepositional phrase: The prepositional phrase \\"with explosives\\" provides additional information about the action of the verb. In this sentence, the preposition \\"with\\" shows the method or means by which the action (destroying the warehouse) was carried out. The prepositional phrase consists of the preposition \\"with\\" and the plural noun \\"explosives\\" as its object. Using these grammatical elements, the sentence communicates the meaning effectively and follows the English language's standard grammatical rules.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Michael Moore is an eccentric, self-taught documentary film director who begins by introducing himself and his family through 8 mm archival home movies; in a voice-over, he describes himself as \\"kind of a strange child,\\" the Irish American Catholic middle-class son of a General Motors employee assembling AC Spark Plugs. Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the life in GM's factories, including the members of Grand Funk Railroad, Casey Kasem, the spouses of Zubin Mehta (Nancy Kovack) and Don Knotts, and \\"Flint's most famous native son,\\" game show host Bob Eubanks.Initially, he achieves his dream of avoiding the dreary tradition of blue-collared factory life that lays for the majority of the population of Flint; by moving to California and working for a magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is (according to Moore) experiencing record profits.Disguised as a TV journalist from Toledo, Ohio, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong antipathy to General Motors chairman Roger B. Smith. Moore begins seeking out Smith himself to confront him with an \\"up-close-and-personal\\" interview about the closing of the Flint auto factories. He tries to visit Smith at GM's headquarters in Detroit, yet he is blocked by building security guards as Moore hasn't made an appointment.

To my delight, the film proved to be an mesmerizing cinematic experience. Directed by the brilliant visionary, Sam Quintana, and starring the irresistible duo of Alex Garcia and Jenna Kirkwood, \\"(ii.)\\" takes the audience on a beautiful, emotional journey that resonates deeply within the vast landscape of human experiences. The film begins with our two protagonists, Sam and Lily, who find themselves entangled in an unexpected romance. Set primarily in the charming town of Elmswick, Quintana's keen eye for both minute details and breathtaking backdrops enchants viewers, accentuating the whirlwind romance that unfolds before them. Soon enough, we are drawn into the protagonists' budding love story, exploring the nuances of companionship and vulnerability amidst the everyday challenges of life. Both Garcia and Kirkwood shine in their respective roles as Sam, a young man searching for inspiration in his otherwise monotonous life, and Lily, an ambitious artist learning to navigate the pitfalls of her creative pursuits. Garcia perfectly encapsulates the emotional complexity of discovering new paths in life, while Kirkwood masterfully pulls viewers into her world of passion and determination. Their undeniable chemistry fills the screen, leaving audiences invested and enthralled. Cinematographer Alain Richards adds to the film's magic with his stunning visuals.

O'Connor masterfully integrates both familiar and original compositions, playing with a variety of styles, tempos, and arrangements that reflect the emotional rollercoaster the characters embark upon.

It not only showcases the virtues of vulnerability but also underlines the importance of self-discovery and growth. In the presence of intense emotions, the film reminds us that sometimes, the most profound transformations occur. Quintana's masterpiece, however, would be incomplete without acknowledging its supporting cast's contributions. From the humorous antics of Lily's best friend, played by the effervescent Tamara Martinez, to the wisdom offered by Sam's mentor, expertly portrayed by the veteran actor Gregory Daniels, each character in \\"(ii.)\\" is thoughtfully crafted to enrich the tapestry of the film's world.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech... Answer:","output":"Smetana's piece is now called the Festive Symphony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On a rainy December morning it's business as usual, so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building, checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside, Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block, Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back.

In Week 6, the Redskins played on the road for the second consecutive Sunday, this time against the 4-1 New York Jets, who had held three of their first four opponents to 14 points or less and were coming off of their bye week. Washington punted after going three-and-out on their first possession of the game. They were quickly back on offense, however, as Jets receiver Eric Decker was stripped by Bashaud Breeland at the Jets' 37-yard-line. After driving down to the 2-yard-line, Washington scored on a Kirk Cousins touchdown pass to Pierre Gar&#231;on, thanks to an uncharacteristic coverage error by former All-Pro cornerback Darrelle Revis. New York's first four plays on the next drive all involved running back Chris Ivory, and gained 33 yards. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick then threw a 35-yard pass to Eric Decker, and Ivory punched it in for the tying score two plays later. The Jets' stingy defense held the Redskins in check on their next drive, forcing another punt to end the first quarter. Chris Ivory then energized the raucous New York crowd with a 54-yard run to just outside the Redskins' 20, but the drive stalled and placekicker Nick Folk tacked on three more points, giving New York a 10-7 lead. Three punts followed, two by Washington and one by New York, before Breeland forced and recovered his second fumble of the game, this one off of 5-time Pro Bowler and former All-Pro receiver Brandon Marshall. With a short field, Cousins and the Redskins gained 19 yards, and Redskins kicker Dustin Hopkins booted a career-long 54-yard field goal to tie the game at 10-10 with just over two minutes remaining in the first half. Fitzpatrick led the Jets into Redskins territory with three short passes that gained 32 yards, before being intercepted by Breeland at the Washington 20-yard-line, Breeland's third turnover recovery of the half. Six plays and three timeouts later, Hopkins converted a 30-yard field goal to give the visiting Redskins a 13-10 halftime lead. On the first New York drive of the second half, back-to-back plays by Ivory carried the Jets across midfield, and the game was quickly tied again thanks to a Nick Folk field goal. After a Jets punt and an Alfred Morris 2-yard run, Cousins was intercepted by Revis, who returned the ball to the Redskins' 18-yard line. Fitzpatrick, not normally known as a particularly mobile quarterback, saw a hole in the defense and scored an 18-yard rushing touchdown on the very next play. Washington had gone from a 3-point lead to a 7-point deficit in a span of only five plays, and now trailed 20-13. The turnover also kept alive Cousins' streak of having thrown an interception in every road game of his career. The next Redskins drive, a three-and-out, did nothing to help them regain the momentum, nor did the 14-yard Marshall catch, 18-yard Zac Stacy run, or 35-yard touchdown reception, also by Marshall, on the next Jets drive. Badly hoping to get themselves back in the game, the Redskins called a deep pass to former Duke University receiver Jamison Crowder, but Jets safety Marcus Gilchrist intercepted the ball for Cousins' second turnover of the game. New York continued to pile up big plays, as well, with a 32-yard Ivory run to start the drive, and two third-down conversions totaling 28 yards. Fitzpatrick capitalized on those conversions, and threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Decker, wrapping up a 21-0 third quarter that resulted in a 34-13 Jets lead. Still reeling with 11 minutes left, Washington desperately tried to mount a comeback, engineering a 59-yard drive that resulted in no points, due to an incomplete pass on 4th-and-1 from the Jets 2-yard-line. They ended up scoring later in the fourth quarter, but not on offense; undrafted rookie Rashad Ross blocked a Jets punt and recovered it in the endzone, which provided the game's final score of 34-20. The hometown New York Jets improved to a surprising 5-1, already surpassing their win total from the entire 2014 season. The Washington Redskins dropped to 2-4 on the season with the loss, and 0-3 on the road. In each of their four losses, Cousins had thrown 2 interceptions; he had thrown none in the two victories. Murmurs calling for coach Jay Gruden to be fired had begun to escalate. Answer this question: How many yards difference was there between Ryan Fitzpatrick's rushing touchdown and his touchdown pass to Eric Decker?","output":"To find the difference in yards between Ryan Fitzpatrick's rushing touchdown and his touchdown pass to Eric Decker, we need to first identify the yards for each event in the given text. 1. It's mentioned that Fitzpatrick scored an 18-yard rushing touchdown after Cousins was intercepted by Revis: \\"Fitzpatrick, not normally known as a particularly mobile quarterback, saw a hole in the defense and scored an 18-yard rushing touchdown on the very next play.\\" 2. Later, it's mentioned that Fitzpatrick threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Decker: \\"Fitzpatrick capitalized on those conversions, and threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Decker...\\" Now, to find the difference between the two touchdowns, we subtract the Decker's 2-yard touchdown from Fitzpatrick's 18-yard rushing touchdown. 18 (Fitzpatrick's rushing touchdown) - 2 (Decker's touchdown pass) = 16 yards There was a 16-yard difference between Ryan Fitzpatrick's rushing touchdown and his touchdown pass to Eric Decker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer criticizes the characters as \\"spoiled, rich, white dixie (ditsie) debs\\" and \\"one rather unlikeable offspring,\\" implying a lack of depth or complexity in character development. The reviewer describes the characters as \\"one dimensional,\\" \\"totally self-absorbed,\\" and people they \\"would not want to know,\\" expressing a strong dissatisfaction with the story's main subjects.  Additionally, according to the reviewer, the prominent role of \\"perennial alcoholics\\" in the story appears to be off-putting. This suggests that the themes or lifestyles portrayed in the book are not relatable or appealing to them. While they mention appreciating the \\"descriptive prose regarding the 'sisters' as young girls\\", it's clear that this single positive comment is overwhelmed by the numerous negative aspects they identified in the book. However, it's important to consider the subjective nature of book reviews. Just because this particular reviewer didn't enjoy the book doesn't mean that everyone else won't. Different readers have different interests, perspectives, and tastes. What one reader finds unappealing, another might find intriguing or realistic.

The statement provided shares essential details about the organization, such as its purpose, General Secretary, and President, but does not provide any information about its stability, financial health, or potential challenges.  In order to evaluate whether the BFDA will last for a significant period, we would need to consider factors such as: 1. Membership size and growth: A healthy organization should have a substantial and growing number of registered members. By analyzing membership statistics and trends, one can deduce the current standing and projected future of the organization. 2. Financial sustainability: An organization must maintain sufficient financial resources to support its activities and meet its objectives. This could include membership fees, sponsorships, and partnerships with other organizations in the film industry. If the BFDA is struggling financially, it may face difficulties in continuing its activities over the long term. 3. External factors: The overall health of the film industry in Bangladesh may influence the BFDA's future prospects. Economic stability, government policy, and audience preferences can either bolster or weaken the industry, subsequently affecting the association's longevity. 4. Internal management and operations: The BFDA's leadership and decision-making process can significantly impact its success and sustainability. Competent leaders who effectively govern the organization, communicate with members, and carry out relevant activities contribute to the association's longevity. 5. Goals and objectives: An organization must have clear and achievable goals reflecting its mission and vision. The BFDA's ability to meet these objectives will determine its relevance and capability to endure as a trade body for film directors in Bangladesh.

Since Jolene's grandmother has just turned 66 years old, she falls in an older age group where the likelihood of developing breast cancer is higher compared to younger individuals like her granddaughter.  There are various reasons as to why the risk of breast cancer increases with age. One of the primary factors is hormonal changes that affect the body as it ages. Women experience hormonal fluctuations throughout their lives, particularly during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, leading to an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Moreover, as a woman gets older, her cumulative lifetime exposure to estrogen increases, which has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. Another reason is the gradual accumulation of genetic and cellular damage over time. As cells divide and grow, the chance of genetic mutations increases. When the body's repair and defense mechanisms slow down or become less effective, some of these damaged cells may transform into cancerous cells. In addition, lifestyle and environmental factors, such as exposure to carcinogenic substances, can also build up over time and contribute to an increased risk of breast cancer. It is important to acknowledge, however, that being more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer in older age does not imply that Jolene's grandmother will get breast cancer; it only refers to a higher likelihood compared to her younger granddaughter. Regular screenings, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and keeping up-to-date with any new recommendations from healthcare professionals are essential for Jolene's grandmother to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. During World War II, the United Kingdom had to cope with widespread food shortages and rationing that left sugar in short supply and chocolate almost unheard of. Which made Nazi boobytrap chocholate bombs all the more insulting, as Nick Higham reports for BBC News.      Drawings of exploding candy bars, bombs disguised as cans of motor oil and other “unpleasant weapons” were recently rediscovered after 70 years, writes Higham. Intended to be used as a warning to British forces looking to take the bite out of booby traps, the drawings give an intriguing glimpse into the world of WWII espionage.      'Chocolate bomb' among WW2 boobytraps http://t.co/LDD7Lyzkb7 — BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) September 30, 2015      The drawings of these odd German weapons were made by a man named Laurence Fish who worked for MI5's counter-sabotage unit. They were meant as a field guide to German booby traps, to teach agents how to diffuse these strange bombs if they encountereted them.      Fish’s widow discovered 25 of the drawings after her husband’s death, but they were put in storage until they were recently discovered by the daughter of Victor Rothschild, who commissioned the drawings. (Gloustershire Echo has more information about their recovery.) Though a plot to kill Winston Churchill using the cruel candy has been known since a secret letter was uncovered in 2009, the drawings have not been made public until now.      Not to be outdone by a few bombs, the British engaged in several ingenious acts of espionage and deception during the war. But it wasn’t all cool booby traps and clever ruses. The Brits’ ultimate act of trickery was one that occurred in plain sight — Operation Fortitude, a huge fake army made of inflatables and wood that diverted Axis attention from key landing sites that would enable the Allies to land at Normandy and take back Europe. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Laurence Fish was recruited by MI5 to design hidden booby trap bombs during the war      Drawings of wartime boobytrap bombs, including an exploding chocolate bar and devices intended to sink ships, have been rediscovered after 70 years.      The drawings were made by a young artist called Laurence Fish for MI5's counter-sabotage unit.      There is an incendiary bomb designed as a Thermos flask, an army mess tin with a bomb hidden beneath the bangers and mash, and a high-explosive device concealed in a can of motor oil.      There is a magnetic limpet mine for a ship's hull which explodes when detached.      And there are timing devices ranging from the highly complex to the remarkably simple - like a test tube full of dried peas which expand as they absorb water and push two contacts together.      All were unpleasant weapons dreamt up by German sabotage experts to spread havoc among their British enemies.      The exploding chocolate bar, it is rumoured, was intended as part of an assassination attempt on Winston Churchill - though how it was supposed to reach him, and how the Germans might ensure that it was Churchill himself who tried to break off a slab, rather than a member of his family or his staff, isn't clear.      Image copyright Antony Thompson/TWN Image caption One of Fish's drawings shows an Army mess tin adapted for nefarious purposes      The 25 drawings, exquisite examples of 1940s draughtsmanship, were commissioned from Laurence Fish by Victor Rothschild.      Rothschild and his secretary (later his wife) made up two-thirds of MI5's tiny counter-sabotage unit.      The third member was a seconded police detective inspector, Donald Fish.      When Rothschild was looking for someone to document the disguised and booby-trapped devices he was uncovering, Fish suggested his son, a self-taught draughstman who had learnt his trade before the war working for Alvis cars.      'Ingenious'      The idea was that the drawings would serve as a kind of manual for anyone who had to defuse similar devices. And there were plenty of them.      The historian Nigel West, who has written several books on espionage, says: \\"The Germans during the Second World War were very keen on destroying ships and their cargoes leaving neutral ports for the United Kingdom.      \\"The idea was to starve Britain into submission. And they created some very ingenious devices which could be smuggled aboard ships and placed in the cargo holds with long-term timers: they wanted the ships to catch fire or to sink whilst out at sea.\\"      Image copyright Antony Thompson/TWN Image caption Another of the boobytrap devices documented was a motor oil can with an explosive inside      Rothschild was a larger-than-life character, a scientist and self-appointed expert on many things, who as the fourth Baron Rothschild later became head of Prime Minister Edward Heath's pioneering Think Tank.      He was also brave. He won the George Medal for defusing a booby-trap device concealed by the Germans in a consignment of onions which had come by ship from Spain via Gibraltar.      A Royal Navy lieutenant had lost an arm and an eye tackling a similar device.      Rothschild gave a running commentary over a field telephone as he worked, so that his secretary could take notes and keep a record of every step he took, in case something else went wrong.      'Amazing' partnership      \\"Rothschild was immensely generous with his family's money,\\" says Nigel West.      \\"He didn't draw a salary; he almost certainly paid Fish for the illustrations himself; he made his family house up at Tring available to MI5 officers who were bombed out of their houses in central London.      \\"And when MI5 needed an office in Paris upon the liberation, Victor just simply made available one of his mansions.\\"      Rothschild, who was a lieutenant colonel, commissioned drawings from Laurence Fish, a humble aircraftsman, via letters stamped \\"Secret\\". They show evidence of a close working relationship.      \\"They got on so well together,\\" says Fish's widow, Jean Bray.      \\"It was an amazing combination.      \\"Rothschild had very great respect for Laurence... I don't know why, but it worked well.\\"      Image copyright Antony Thompson/TWN Image caption The Germans hoped to starve Britain into submission by destroying supply ships      Fish kept the letters. But the drawings vanished. Rothschild had his favourite framed and hung it on the wall of his study. A couple of others were known from photographs. Otherwise, nothing.      Then a few weeks ago, members of the Rothschild family were clearing out their house in Suffolk when they discovered a sheaf of drawings in \\"deep storage\\" in a chest of drawers.      Rothschild's daughter Victoria realised what they were and got in touch with Jean.      Rotating disc      In the 1950s and onwards Laurence became a successful poster artist, graphic designer and landscape painter, putting his wartime work behind him.      \\"It was interesting work obviously,\\" Jean told me, \\"and it must have been very concentrated work, but he wasn't going to make any money out of it so as soon as the war was over he'd got to do something that earned him a penny.\\"      In her husband's old studio at the top of their home in the pretty Gloucestershire village of Winchcombe she showed me the pile of drawings, carefully wrapped in brown paper, cardboard and tissue paper, that Victoria Rothschild Gray had sent her.      The exploding chocolate bar may be the most famous, but Jean's personal favourite is an exceptionally intricate 21-day timer involving a rotating disc.      At the top, it says, in especially bold letters, \\"Do not unscrew here.\\" At the bottom, equally bold, are the words: \\"Unscrew here first.\\"      Now Jean hopes that a museum or archive will agree to take the pictures: freehand precision drawings made long before the age of computer-aided design, and a fascinating record of fiendish wartime ingenuity ||||| A Nazi plot to kill Sir Winston Churchill with a bar of exploding chocolate during the Second World War has been revealed in historic papers.      Giving a new meaning to the dessert name “death by chocolate”, Adolf Hitler’s bomb makers coated explosive devices with a thin layer of rich dark chocolate, then packaged it in expensive-looking black and gold paper.      The Germans apparently planned to use secret agents working in Britain to discreetly place the bars - branded as Peters Chocolate - among other luxury items taken into the dining room used by the War Cabinet during the conflict.      The lethal slabs of confection were packed with enough explosives to kill anyone within several metres.      But the plot was foiled by British spies who discovered the chocolate was being made and tipped off one of MI5’s most senior intelligence chiefs, Lord Victor Rothschild, before the wartime prime minister’s life could be endangered.      Lord Rothschild, a scientist in peace time as well as a key member of the Rothschild banking family, immediately typed a letter to a talented illustrator seconded to his unit, asking him to draw poster-size images of the chocolate to warn the public to be on the look-out.      His letter to the artist, Laurence Fish, is dated May 4, 1943 and was written from his secret bunker in Parliament Street, London.      It was unearthed by Mr Fish's wife, journalist Jean Bray, as she sorted through his possessions after the artist's death at the age of 89 in 2009.      The letter, marked \\"secret\\", reads: “Dear Fish, I wonder if you could do a drawing for me of an explosive slab of chocolate.      “We have received information that the enemy are using pound slabs of chocolate which are made of steel with a very thin covering of real chocolate.      “Inside there is high explosive and some form of delay mechanism…When you break off a piece of chocolate at one end in the normal way, instead of it falling away, a piece of canvas is revealed stuck into the middle of the piece which has been broken off and a ticking into the middle of the remainder of the slab.”      The letter explained how the mechanism would be activated when the piece of chocolate was pulled sharply, which would also pull the canvas, and Lord Rothschild said he was enclosing a “very poor sketch” done by someone who had seen one of the bars.      He asked the artist to indicate in the text on his drawing that a bomb would go off seven seconds after the piece of chocolate and attached canvas was pulled out. ||||| These drawings show the amazing array of booby trap bombs dreamed up by the Nazis to kill the British during WWII - which have been rediscovered after 70 years.      The sketches were made for MI5's counter-sabotage unit after British spies obtained intelligence on a number of crafty devices being made by the Germans.            Among the 25 drawings - many of them previously unseen - are an exploding chocolate bar intended to kill Winston Churchill and a bomb camouflaged as a Thermos flask.            There is also an army mess tin with a bomb hidden behind the bangers and mash, a highly explosive device concealed in a can of motor oil and devices intended to sink ships.            Drawings of both simple and complex timing devices - such as a test tube of dried peas which expand as they absorb water and push two contacts together - were also found.            The artist was Laurence Fish, a humble aircraftsman who was commissioned to undertake the work by lieutenant colonel Victor Rothschild in letters stamped \\"secret\\".            Fish's widow Jean Bray unearthed the letters - which were written from a secret bunker in London - as she sorted through his possessions after he died in 2009, aged 89.            The drawings had never been seen publicly until a few weeks ago, when Rothschild's daughter, Victoria, found them when she was clearing out the family home in Suffolk.            She discovered the sheaf of drawings in \\"deep storage\\" in a chest of drawers and, when she realised what they were, got in touch with Jean.            Jean, 82, an archivist and former journalist living in Winchcombe, Glos., said: \\"I didn't know that the drawings existed.            \\"He always kept the letters, but nobody knew what had happened to the drawings. We presumed that they had been destroyed or lost.            \\"It was only this summer that they were discovered.            \\"It was so exciting. There was a lot of excitement when people saw the letters, and we have been looking for the drawings since.            \\"There are 25 which range in size from A4 to A1, which is pretty big.            \\"Nowadays people would say these drawings are nothing and you could do it with a computer in seconds.            \\"But there was no machinery or anything like that at the time. They are all hand drawn.\\"            Laurence Fish, a self-taught draughtsman, was commissioned to do the drawings after his father, detective inspector Donald Fish, suggested him for the job.            Donald Fish was part of the MI5 counter-sabotage unit, which had just three members - the other two being Rothschild and his secretary, who later became his wife.            Rothschild had been looking for someone to draw the booby-trapped devices he was uncovering, and he quickly formed a close working relationship with the new artist.            \\"They got on so well together,\\" said Jean, Fish's widow.            \\"It was an amazing combination. Rothschild had very great respect for Laurence - I don't know why, but it worked well.\\"            Rothschild, who later became head of Prime Minister Edward Heath's Think Tank, hung his favourite drawings in frames on the wall of his study.            They are now all being kept in the old studio of the late artist, who became a successful graphic designer and landscape painter in the 1950s.            Fish's most well-known drawing is that of the exploding chocolate bar, which is thought to have been intended for use in an assassination attempt on Winston Churchill.            But Jean said her favourite is an intricate drawing of a 21-day timer involving a rotating disc, which has instructions reading, \\"do not unscrew here\\", and \\"unscrew here first\\".

In 1993, Winfrey hosted a rare prime-time interview with Michael Jackson, which became the fourth most-watched event in American television history as well as the most watched interview ever, with an audience of 36.5 million. On December 1, 2005, Winfrey appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote the new Broadway musical The Color Purple, of which she was a producer, joining the host for the first time in 16 years. The episode was hailed by some as the \\"television event of the decade\\" and helped Letterman attract his largest audience in more than 11 years: 13.45 million viewers. Although a much-rumored feud was said to have been the cause of the rift, both Winfrey and Letterman balked at such talk. \\"I want you to know, it's really over, whatever you thought was happening\\", said Winfrey. On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, as its season premiere was filmed in New York City.  In 2006, rappers Ludacris, 50 Cent and Ice Cube criticized Winfrey for what they perceived as an anti-hip hop bias. In an interview with GQ magazine, Ludacris said that Winfrey gave him a \\"hard time\\" about his lyrics, and edited comments he made during an appearance on her show with the cast of the film Crash. He also said that he wasn't initially invited on the show with the rest of the cast. Winfrey responded by saying that she is opposed to rap lyrics that \\"marginalize women\\", but enjoys some artists, including Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. In September 2008, Winfrey received criticism after Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report reported that Winfrey refused to have Sarah Palin on her show, allegedly because of Winfrey's support for Barack Obama. Winfrey denied the report, maintaining that there never was a discussion regarding Palin's appearing on her show. She said that after she made public her support for Obama, she decided that she would not let her show be used as a platform for any of the candidates. Although Obama appeared twice on her show, those appearances were prior to his declaring himself a candidate. Winfrey added that Palin would make a fantastic guest and that she would love to have her on the show after the election, which she did on November 18, 2009.  In 2009, Winfrey was criticized for allowing actress Suzanne Somers to appear on her show to discuss hormone treatments that are not accepted by mainstream medicine. Critics have also suggested that Winfrey is not tough enough when questioning celebrity guests or politicians whom she appears to like.

The history of Bank of America dates back to October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. The Bank of Italy served the needs of many immigrants settling in the United States at that time, providing services denied to them by the existing American banks which typically discriminated against them and often denied service to all but the wealthiest. Giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather Lorenzo Scatena, as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee. When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck, Giannini was able to save all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires. Because San Francisco's banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults, Giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster. From a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels, he lent money to those who wished to rebuild.

The Bank of Italy, founded by Amadeo Pietro Giannini on October 17, 1904, in San Francisco, California, served as the foundation of what would eventually become Bank of America. The initial mission of the Bank of Italy was to provide financial services to immigrants and working-class individuals in the United States who were often discriminated against by traditional American banks. Over the years, the Bank of Italy underwent several transformations and mergers. In 1928, it merged with the Bank of America, Los Angeles, and shortly after, in 1929, the Bank of Italy changed its name to Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association. The bank continued to grow and expand throughout the 20th century, acquiring numerous other financial institutions along the way. By the 21st century, Bank of America had become one of the largest banking institutions in the United States and worldwide. Today, the corporation offers a wide range of financial services, including personal banking, credit cards, mortgages, investment advice, and more. Through its history of growth and acquisitions, the organization has maintained its roots in the United States, as its origins trace back to the early 20th-century Bank of Italy in San Francisco."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Demand is identified and then satisfied through a supply chain. Attempts are made to increase demand through advertising. In the 2000s, an increasing amount of retailing began occurring online using electronic payment and delivery via a courier or via postal mail. Retailing as a sector includes subordinated services, such as delivery. The term \\"retailer\\" is also applied where a service provider services the small orders of a large number of individuals, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shops may be on residential streets, streets with few or no houses, or in a shopping mall. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create a more comfortable shopping environment  protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of electronic-commerce used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions) and mail order.  - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Pole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole (which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber) as an aid to jump over a bar. Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks, Cretans and Celts. It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and 2000 for women.  - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423  348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.  - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.  - Konstadinos Filippidis ( Greek :   ; born 26 November 1986 in Athens ) is a Greek pole vaulter .  - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles.  - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.

The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world.  - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf.  - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications.

Seat belts The best answer is D, seat belts, which have widely been recognized as an essential feature in vehicles for the sake of safety. While all the other options listed (A. windows, B. trunks, C. four wheels, and E. diesel engines) are components found in cars, none of them directly address the concern of safety as effectively as seat belts do. Seat belts are designed to secure passengers during a car crash or an abrupt stop, to prevent them from being ejected or experiencing potentially fatal injuries. The use of seat belts can greatly reduce the risk of death and serious injuries in vehicle accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), seat belts saved an estimated 14,955 lives in the United States in 2017. The significance of seat belts was first recognized in the 1950s, when various research conducted by automotive engineers, such as Volvo's Nils Bohlin, demonstrated the lifesaving potential of seat belts. In 1959, Volvo became the first automaker to introduce three-point seat belts, which are now the standard in most vehicles. Since then, numerous countries have passed legislation requiring the installation of seat belts in vehicles and mandating their use by passengers. In the United States, for instance, seat belt laws began to be enacted on a state-by-state basis in the 1960s, with New York being the first state to pass a law requiring seat belt use in 1984. The effectiveness of seat belts becomes apparent when we look at the statistics. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seat belts reduce the risk of death for front-seat vehicle occupants by 45% and the risk of serious injury by 50%. Furthermore, the NHTSA estimates that between 1960 and 2012, seat belts saved over 329,000 lives. In conclusion, due to safety concerns, a law was passed that all cars must have seat belts. This life-saving device has significantly contributed to reducing the risk of death and injury in vehicular accidents and remains the most critical safety feature in modern vehicles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They take the bear back to their research station where David calls his daughter Evelyn and pleads her to come up. Their relationship has become strained as the recent death of her mother was complicated with the fact that David could not make it to the funeral. She tentatively agrees to come up when he offers to give her all the money left to her by her mother. After getting off the line with her, David and Jane are told that the bear has died and they go to investigate. Meanwhile a group of students, Ling, Freddie and Adam are selected to attend Kruipen's research.Days later, the research team is feeling the effects of a strange illness, and Kruipen instructs helicopter pilot Bart to not bring his daughter to the station. However Evelyn's insistence forces him to go against David's orders and take her along with the students to the station. They arrive, but no one is there. Evelyn calls out and reaches Jane who learns that despite warning them away as David had said, he did not tell them not to come. In reaction, Jane shoots and apparently kills Kruipen and another researcher and makes her escape.

Would \\"They are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania .\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"A contingent fee with an attorney, often referred to as a contingency fee, is a payment agreement between the client and their legal representative, which depends upon the outcome of the case. In a contingency fee arrangement, the attorney agrees to represent the client without charging any upfront retainer fees or hourly rates. Instead, the attorney's compensation is based on a percentage of the settlement or monetary award that the client receives if they win their case. This type of fee arrangement is particularly common in personal injury cases, where the client might not have the financial resources to pay for an attorney upfront. Contingent fees provide clients with access to legal representation regardless of their financial situation, as the attorney takes the risk of not receiving payment if the case is unsuccessful. These fees motivate the attorney to achieve the best possible outcome for the client, as their compensation is directly tied to the results. In the context of Lithuania, the statement \\"They are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania\\" is, indeed, a reasonable answer. Contingent fee arrangements are permitted and regulated by the Lithuanian Code of Civil Procedure and the Rules of Professional Conduct for Advocates in Lithuania. The specific regulations concerning contingent fee arrangements may vary depending on the type of legal representation and the specific circumstances of the case. However, it is crucial to note that there are certain restrictions and guidelines in place to ensure that clients are treated fairly and ethically. Attorneys are required to maintain transparency and disclose the terms of the contingent fee agreement in writing before accepting the case. Additionally, the percentage of the attorney's fee may be subject to limitations imposed by law or professional regulations. In summary, a contingent fee arrangement with an attorney is a payment agreement in which the attorney's fees depend on the successful resolution of the client's case. They are common in personal injury cases and allowed in Lithuania, subject to adherence to certain regulations and guidelines. The statement \\"They are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania\\" is accurate, as long as the arrangement follows the local guidelines and restrictions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her 17-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, 8-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother is a shrewd woman who always dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Mark is the only one in the family who is even remotely friendly or respectful to Dawn and even that isn't saying a whole lot. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is verbally bullied by literally every student she comes into contact with. She is teased and ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home, Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (the same verbal way that other students at the school call Dawn). Dawn is suspended for three days after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. She refuses to tell her parents or the school principal about the bullying, aware that it will only lead to worse bullying for herself. Brandon's first attempt to rape Dawn after school fails, but he orders her to meet him again. After she complies, he takes her to an abandoned field. Instead of forcing himself upon her, Brandon starts an earnest conversation with her and kisses her.

Options: - flat - flat ground - downhill - straight - top  Explain why a human would choose \\"flat ground\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"flat ground\\" as the answer to the question above because in the given scenario, Susan is experiencing difficulty climbing the slopes. This difficulty could be due to the steep incline, uneven terrain, or physically demanding nature of climbing uphill. Flat ground provides a more stable and manageable surface for walking or standing, allowing Susan to catch her breath and exert less effort in comparison to the slopes.  While the other options may seem plausible at first, they are less likely to be chosen: - \\"Flat\\" could be open to interpretation, but without context like \\"ground,\\" it is less specific and clear; - \\"Downhill\\" might appear as an alternative to going uphill, but it can still be challenging due to the need for balance and possible strain on knees and ankles; - \\"Straight\\" isn't the best answer because it doesn't necessarily imply an easier path, a straight path could still be sloped; - \\"Top\\" might indicate reaching the end or peak of the climb, but it does not directly address Susan's current wish for an easier time climbing.

To offer a thorough understanding, let's break down the sentence and focus on each of its components. The sentence states, \\"Joe paid the detective after *he* delivered the final report on the case.\\" Here, we can identify two main clauses: 1. Joe paid the detective 2. he delivered the final report on the case The actions or verbs in these clauses are \\"paid\\" (in the first clause) and \\"delivered\\" (in the second clause). The subject in the first clause is \\"Joe,\\" while the subject in the second clause is represented by the pronoun \\"he.\\" Now, when examining the context of the sentence and understanding the relationship between these clauses, it becomes apparent that the event of \\"paying the detective\\" occurred as a subsequent action following the other event: \\"delivering the final report on the case.\\" To be more precise, the detective performs the action \\"to deliver the final report on the case.\\" Consequently, Joe pays the detective for the service. With this context in mind, it is evident that the pronoun \\"he\\" in the second clause refers to \\"the detective\\" from the first clause. Both terms are representative of the same person, namely the detective, and describe the individual's actions throughout the sentence. In conclusion, in the sentence, \\"Joe paid the detective after *he* delivered the final report on the case,\\" both \\"the detective\\" and \\"he\\" do indeed point to the same individual, as it is a coherent and logical statement illustrating a sequence of events involving the detective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Browns ended a 7-game away losing streak and improved to 2-2 with the win.  For the fourth time this season, the Browns participated in a game that was decided by 3 or fewer points.  It was also the fourth time in as many games that the winning score was produced with less than 2 minutes to go in the 4th quarter.

A:","output":"Given the answer options \\"Yes\\" and \\"No,\\" to the question of whether describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" is valid based on the provided information, one may need to consider the following points: 1. The information provided states that Quinn waited an hour after work for John to get off so they could go home together. It does not specifically mention any sign of jealousy or actions motivated by jealousy on Quinn's part. 2. Quinn waiting for John to finish work could be due to various reasons other than jealousy. It could be a sign of friendship, companionship, or caring. 3. The context of the situation is also essential. If Quinn and John typically go home together or if one of them relies on the other for transportation, waiting an hour might be a practical solution and not necessarily related to jealousy. Based on the information provided, describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" does not seem like a valid conclusion. Without additional context or specific actions that demonstrate jealousy, the scenario presented appears to be neutral in nature, and other descriptive terms for Quinn may be more relevant or accurate.  Now, considering whether \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" is the appropriate response: A \\"Yes\\" response would imply that describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" is valid based on the given information. However, as discussed earlier, the information provided does not necessarily suggest jealousy on Quinn's part. A \\"No\\" response would imply that describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" is not an accurate conclusion based on the provided information about the scenario. This response aligns more with the analysis conducted above and suggests that the scenario could be a result of alternative reasons that are not indicative of jealousy. To sum up, a \\"No\\" response appears to be the fitting answer when evaluating the validity of describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" based on the given information. There might be other reasons behind Quinn's actions, and without further evidence or context related to jealousy, it seems inappropriate to characterize Quinn as a jealous individual."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

If \\"A young man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.\\", can we conclude \\"A man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"A man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house\\" based on the original statement \\"A young man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.\\" Here's an analysis of how we can arrive at that conclusion. The original statement has four basic components: 1. The subject: A young man 2. The action: Jumps up off his skateboard 3. The location: On the street 4. The context: In front of a house The question wants us to examine the validity of the statement \\"A man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.\\" Let's break it down in a similar manner: 1. The subject: A man 2. The action: Jumps up off his skateboard 3. The location: On the street 4. The context: In front of a house Comparing the two statements, we can see that the actions, locations, and contexts are identical. The only difference is in the subject: \\"A young man\\" vs. \\"A man.\\" By analyzing the relationship between these two, we can determine if the conclusion is valid. A young man is, by definition, a male individual who is considered to be in the early period of his life. The term \\"man\\" refers to a male human being without any reference to age. Therefore, a young man falls under the broader category of \\"man.\\" If we had to express this in an explicit manner, the relationship could be represented as: All young men are men. Given that all young men are men, we can say that a statement involving a young man performing an action can also apply to a man in the broader sense. In this case, since the young man is jumping up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house, it would also be accurate to say that a man is jumping up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.

But in the fifteenth century , only two of them were resident in Sisteron , the others were officials of the Roman Curia in Avignon . But , in the fifteenth century , only two of them were resident in Avignon ; the rest were functionaries of the Roman Curia in Sisteron .","output":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia might at first glance appear to convey similar information, they are not the same in meaning.  In the first sentence: \\"But in the fifteenth century, only two of them were resident in Sisteron, the others were officials of the Roman Curia in Avignon.\\" The sentence states that there are two individuals residing in Sisteron, with the remainder acting as officials of the Roman Curia in Avignon. The primary focus of this sentence is on the two individuals in Sisteron, and it establishes the remaining group as being connected to the Roman Curia in Avignon. This sentence highlights Sisteron as the location where only two individuals are residing, implying that the main concentration of the group is in Avignon. In the second sentence: \\"But, in the fifteenth century, only two of them were resident in Avignon; the rest were functionaries of the Roman Curia in Sisteron.\\" This sentence flips the locations mentioned in the first sentence. In this case, only two individuals reside in Avignon, while the rest serve as functionaries of the Roman Curia in Sisteron. This sentence emphasizes Avignon as the location with minimal representation, implying that Sisteron is where the majority of the group is found. In summary, these two sentences express different meanings in terms of the locations and roles associated with the individuals mentioned. The first sentence establishes two residents in Sisteron with the rest in Avignon, while the second sentence reverses it, stating that two residents are in Avignon and the remaining are in Sisteron. The most significant difference is the distribution of the individuals between the two locations, Sisteron, and Avignon."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barry is perfectly creepy and believable.\\" can be perceived as a mixture of positive and negative emotions.  On the positive side, the sentiment is one of appreciation towards Raymond J. Barry's acting skills and the fact that he is \\"believable\\" in his role. This suggests that the speaker thinks that the actor is successful in executing his part, convincingly portraying the character, and adapting well in the specific context. Being \\"believable\\" is an important asset for an actor, as it draws the audience into the story and creates an immersive experience. Therefore, this part of the sentiment communicates praise and admiration for Raymond J. Barry's talent and performance. On the other hand, the sentiment also conveys negative emotions, particularly through the use of the term \\"creepy.\\" This suggests that the actor's portrayal of a character goes beyond just being convincing and into something that evokes feelings of uneasiness, fear, or discomfort in the audience. A \\"creepy\\" character is usually associated with antagonists, villains, or morally ambiguous roles that are meant to elicit a sense of dread or revulsion. In this context, it is essential to remember that portraying a \\"creepy\\" character is not inherently a negative thing for an actor, as it demonstrates versatility in embodying different roles, and the ability to evoke strong emotions from the audience. To sum up, the sentiment of the sentence can be perceived as a blended expression of emotions; acknowledging the actor's successful and impressive performance in conveying a creepy, believable character, while also hinting at the unsettling and fear-provoking nature of the role itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Tha Smokin' Nephew is the first major label studio album by the rapper Baby Bash and his third album overall. Released by Universal Records, it entered the \\"Billboard\\" 200 at number 48. Five months after its release, the album was certified Gold by the RIAA. By March 2005, the album had sold 531,000 copies in the United States. Hypothesis: Baby Bash will release an album that is more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew.","output":"Drawing the hypothesis that Baby Bash will release an album that is more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew relies on various factors and assumptions. While it is possible that he could release a more successful album, we must consider different aspects contributing to the potential success of future albums. 1. Current popularity and fan base: Tha Smokin' Nephew was Baby Bash's first major label studio album, and it helped him gain recognition and a following. Depending on how Baby Bash continues to cultivate his fan base, his growing popularity could contribute to the success of his future albums. If he can maintain or increase his current level of popularity, it increases the likelihood of a more successful album release. 2. Changes in music preferences: Music preferences and trends change over time. As an artist, Baby Bash must adapt and evolve his music style to stay relevant in a competitive industry. Should his future releases fit well within the prevalent tastes of his targeted demographic, there is a higher chance of surpassing the success of Tha Smokin' Nephew. 3. Marketing strategies: A significant factor in the success of an album is its marketing and promotion. Record labels are often responsible for promotions and album releases, and their strategies can directly impact an artist's success. If Baby Bash's label or management devises a more effective marketing plan for his future albums, those releases stand a better chance of being more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew. 4. Collaborations and features: Collaborating with other well-established artists can lead to increased exposure and an artist's music gaining a broader audience. If Baby Bash works with renowned artists and producers in the future, it could boost the likelihood of his albums surpassing the success of Tha Smokin' Nephew. 5. Quality and consistency: The quality of the music in an album plays a crucial role in its success. Baby Bash must continue to improve his craft, create compelling music, and stay consistent with his output. If his future albums maintain a high level of quality, they have a higher chance of being more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew. Taking all of these factors into account, it is possible to hypothesize that Baby Bash could release an album that is more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew. However, this hypothesis relies on assumptions about the artist's growth, the music industry's dynamics, marketing strategies, and continued relevance in the ever-changing landscape of popular music."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The World Health Organization(WHO)planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease.Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries.They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa.The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor .The diseased children are usually from one to four years old.As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body.The skin changes colour and may break out in open sores.The hair changes colour and starts to fall out.The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time.Stomach liquids are no longer produced. The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat.Their mothers gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins.They found that the addition of milk to the food of children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives. Question: It is difficult to discover kwashiorkor because   _  . Answer: A:","output":"It is difficult to discover kwashiorkor because its symptoms are often mistaken for other diseases. In many parts of Africa, where the disease is prevalent, there is a lack of awareness and understanding of the importance of a balanced diet, particularly with regard to protein intake. As a result, the symptoms of kwashiorkor, such as a swollen stomach, changes in skin color, open sores, hair loss, and lethargy, can be misidentified as signs of other illnesses or malnutrition. This makes it challenging for medical professionals to diagnose and treat kwashiorkor effectively, leading to a higher prevalence of the disease among young children aged one to four years old. The key to addressing kwashiorkor is to educate communities on the importance of protein-rich foods like milk and meat to ensure proper nutrition and prevent the onset of this debilitating illness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: how many states have open carry gun laws I found the following answer on Google: The gun rights community has been mixed in its response. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the given answer does not directly answer the question regarding the number of states with open carry gun laws. To provide you with a more detailed and long answer to the question, let's first discuss what open carry gun laws are. Open carry refers to the legal act of carrying a firearm openly in public. In the United States, the open carry gun laws vary from state to state. Some states have permissive open carry laws, which means individuals can openly carry firearms without a permit or license. Other states have more restrictive open carry laws, requiring licenses or permits to carry firearms openly, or prohibiting open carry entirely. As of now, 45 states in the United States allow some form of open carry. However, it is important to keep in mind that even within these states, the laws and regulations may differ regarding where and how firearms can be openly carried. Here's a breakdown of the open carry laws in the United States: 1. Permissive open carry states (no permit required): In these states, individuals can carry openly without any specific permit or license. There are 31 states in this category, including Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia. 2. Licensed open carry states (permit required): In these states, individuals must obtain a permit or license before they can carry firearms openly. There are currently 14 states with licensed open carry laws, including Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. 3. Anomalous open carry states: In these two states (North Carolina and New Mexico), open carry is permitted in certain situations, but not as a blanket rule. They often have specific regulations or restrictions based on the type of firearm, location, or circumstances. 4. Non-permissive open carry states (prohibited): In these four states and the District of Columbia, open carry is generally prohibited, with some exceptions for law enforcement or other specified circumstances. The states in this category are California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Washington D.C. It is essential to understand that these classifications are subject to change as laws are frequently amended or new legislation is passed. Always consult up-to-date state and local laws before openly carrying a firearm. Moreover, concealed carry laws may differ from open carry, so it's necessary to be aware of these distinctions and abide by the specific laws in each state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This was a problem that students and administrators at Washington High School in Beaufort County, North Carolina, were faced with when they noticed that there were some students who weren't getting their basic needs met. Beaufort County, a rural coastal community located about 120 miles east of Raleigh, North Carolina, is a community with \\"some unique needs,\\" Washington High School's Principal Misty Walker tells PEOPLE. According , 21 percent of residents in Beaufort County are living below the poverty level. \\"What we're learning is that if we're not helping meet the basic needs of our students, it's very difficult for our students to focus on academics,\\" Walker says. \\"There have been times when students come up to me in the hallways and they would ask me if I had toothpaste because they didn't have any toothpaste at home,\\" she says, explaining that she would go out and purchase toothpaste, toothbrushes and dental floss for students who asked for it. She shared this experience with Bright Futures Beaufort County, a local affiliate of , a non-profit organization that helps encourage community partnerships for schools to benefit children and young people. When they heard about this, Bright Futures helped the school foster a partnership with First South Bank to establish their first \\"closet\\" focused on hygiene. At the same time, Walker explains, the student government association was trying to find ways to help serve their school community and the needs of students. The school government, administration and Bright Futures joined forces at the beginning of the school year to start their in-school food pantry, focused on supplying students with \\"teen-friendly\\" foods (like cereal bars, Pop-Tarts and foods that don't require a can opener or extensive cooking equipment) in an anonymous and private environment. The food pantry is stocked with goods raised through school food drives, donations gathered by churches (including Old Fort Church of Christ in Washington, North Carolina, which brought in 10 bags of food for the pantry). Student can access the food pantry (as well as their hygiene, school supply and clothing closets) by coming to a guidance counselor or school administrator and asking for help. The counselor will then take the student to the closets to \\"shop\\" for what they want. The student's information is never taken down and no one keeps a written record of what each student takes. Washington High School's clothing closet Misty Walker / Washington High School \\"It is completely anonymous,\\" Walker says. \\"So that when students have needs, they come and they ask and we meet them. I could not tell you all the students who have been helped through this process because there is nowhere where there is some master list. \\"What's interesting is that sometimes there's a notion that students may want to be greedy and take a lot,\\" she says about their take-what-you-want ethos. \\"And what we find is that our students are very judicious in what they take and we actually have to encourage them to take more. \\"For example, if there's a weekend coming up, if we have a student who comes in on Friday with a need we want to make certain that they have something not just for Friday night, but also something that will help them get through until Monday.\\" One of the main problems that the school's food pantry wanted to solve was making sure that the student was actually getting the food that they need. After working with a Backpack Buddy program – which packs up food and supplies for elementary and middle school students to take home – Walker noticed that some of the food was getting consumed before it arrived home with the student. \\"What would happen is when food would go home in the backpacks and when students would get on the bus, another kid might actually take it and go through it and take what they wanted,\\" she explains. Washington High School's hygiene and school supply closet Misty Walker / Washington High School In another situation, Walker explained that she went to a food pantry to get food for one young female student and later found out that there were \\"lots of extended family members\\" living at her home. \\"So, even though you look at the box of food and think that should be a great help, based upon the number of people that are in the home, it doesn't go very far,\\" she says. Walker notes that while she can't measure exactly how many people have used their closest and pantry, she estimates it has helped \\"between 10 and 15 percent\\" of the students. \\"[The pantry] has only been active for about six weeks now,\\" she says \\"But what we're seeing is an increase in self-esteem. And students who have needs, they are being met. They know that since we're doing it on such an anonymous basis, they don't have to worry about anyone talking about them about getting their needs met because no one ever knows.\\" Having basic needs met and building up trust between student in need and school administrators also allows Walker and her colleagues to open a dialogue with the students. \\"Once we develop a relationship with this student and we know that they have this basic need that needs to be met then that leads into other conversations,\\" she explains. \\"Like, 'What do you want to do after high school? What are your goals after high school?' And of course that transitions into the conversation of, 'Well, how are you doing in your classes right now? Do you need any help in your classes right now? Do you need to stay after school to get some help?' And we do what we can to help them succeed. So those types of conversations are critical to help and support that child.\\" While the pantry is focused on prepackaged and canned food at the moment, the food pantry team hopes to expand into supplying fresh produce directly from the school's horticulture program. \\"We're probably a year away from being able to do that,\\" she admits. \\"That is our long-term goal to get where we can also supplement with fresh fruits and fresh vegetables.\\" With holiday breaks coming up, the school is also trying to assess how to make sure needs are being met when students aren't actually at school. Currently, the school is planning on working with individual students and making sure they take home additional food from the pantry to cover their time off. However, they are still trying to plan what to do for summer break. \\"Our greatest challenge we will have during the summer is is transportation for our students to get back and forth,\\" Walker says. \\"And that we don't quite have the solution for yet.\\" Walker says that the school hasn't set up a GoFundMe page yet to raise money but that anyone looking to make a donation – be it financial or physical goods – can do so . People can also make donations directly to Bright Future Beaufort County through the Washington-Beaufort County Chamber of Commerce.

In the early 17th century, the Dutch West India Company was a major player in the colonization and settlement of the Americas. The company controlled vast areas of land in North and South America, as well as the Caribbean, through a series of charter agreements with the Dutch government. The company's main purpose was to control trade, particularly in furs, as well as to expand the territory governed by the Dutch. In this capacity, the company leased land to settlers, traders, and farmers, including Pieter Bronck. Pieter Bronck arrived in New Amsterdam (present-day New York City) in 1639. In the early 1640s, he leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem, on Manhattan Island, hence, the name \\"Bronck's Land.\\" This area lies in present-day Mott Haven and Port Morris neighborhoods in the South Bronx. Aside from leasing land from the Dutch West India Company, Bronck also secured additional tracts of land through purchases from the local Native American tribes. During this period, it was customary for European settlers to negotiate land deals directly with the indigenous people, who were the original inhabitants of the region. In 1641, Bronck purchased around 500 acres of land from the local Lenape Native American tribes, chiefs Ranaqua and Tackamuck. These tracts were located in the area that is now known as the Bronx. The purchased land extended from the Harlem River to the Aquahung River, which today is called the Bronx River. Bronck's land acquisitions made him one of the first European landowners in the Bronx, and it was this connection that eventually led to the borough being named after him. In conclusion, Pieter Bronck got his land from two entities: the Dutch West India Company, from whom he leased land on the neck of the mainland north of Harlem, and the local Native American tribes, primarily Lenape, from whom he purchased additional tracts of land. These transactions helped to establish Bronck as a prominent figure in the early Dutch period of New York history and set the stage for his legacy as the namesake of the borough of the Bronx."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: How long ago was it…? It was a long time is all I know. For my birthday, my parents took me and my brother out of school on the day before my birthday and we took a train. (Funny interjection, my mom was caught on the wrong side of the station so she ran across the rails and was pulled up by my dad a couple minutes before the train came.) It was a night train, so we had our own room where my brother and I claimed the top as our territory. (Look at my younger self’s squinty eyes… They are staring into your soul) Anyways, it was morning by the time we arrived at where I would spend my birthday. Vienna, Austria. I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good. The following days we went to Austrian Castle, Ice Cave, and more buildings and such. The trip overall made this birthday the most memorable and the best thus far. Bonus: We missed our night train back because of daylight saving hours. The trip back was definitely hectic, but adventurous. Question: what did he have for breakfast?

Next question: the contract that exists between the insurer and the insured?","output":"The contract that exists between the insurer and the insured is called an insurance policy. To explain this, let's break down the steps involved in creating and understanding this contract: 1. Identifying the parties involved: In an insurance policy, there are two primary parties: the insurer and the insured. The insurer is the insurance company providing coverage, and the insured is the individual or entity receiving coverage. 2. Assessing the risk: Before an insurance policy is issued, the insurer will assess the risk associated with the applicant (the insured). This assessment helps the insurer determine the likelihood of a claim being filed, which factors into the cost of the policy. 3. Determining the premium: The insurer will set a price for the insurance policy, known as the premium. This is the amount the insured must pay to maintain their coverage. Premiums can be paid monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. 4. Defining the policy term: Insurance policies have a specified term, which is the period during which coverage is active. The policy term can be stated in months or years, and it outlines the duration and expiration date of the coverage. 5. Establishing coverage limits: The insurance policy will outline the limits of coverage, which is the maximum amount the insurer will pay out in the event of a claim. Limits can be per occurrence or aggregated over the policy term. 6. Defining exclusions: Each insurance policy has certain exclusions, which are situations or events that the policy specifically does not cover. These will be outlined in the policy document. 7. Describing conditions and duties: The insurance policy will include various conditions that the insured must meet to maintain their coverage. Additionally, the policy will describe duties the insured must perform in the event of a claim. 8. Issuing the policy: Once the insurer and insured have agreed upon the terms of the policy, the insurer will issue the policy to the insured. The policy will typically be a written document that both parties sign, signifying their agreement to the policy's terms. 9. Filing claims and receiving benefits: If the insured experiences a loss or event covered by the policy, they must file a claim with the insurer. The insurer will then review the claim and, if approved, provide the benefits as outlined in the policy. 10. Renewal and adjustments: At the end of the policy term, the insurer and insured may discuss renewal and any necessary adjustments to the policy's terms or coverage. This can include changes to the premium, policy limits, or exclusions. In summary, the contract between an insurer and insured is known as an insurance policy. It establishes the terms, coverage, and obligations for both parties involved and serves as the foundation for their insurance relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"but how come we weren't doing this say twenty years ago you know\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"but why did we not do this in the past\\" is true (see options)?  1). yes 2). it is not possible to tell 3). no","output":"Based on the premise \\"but how come we weren't doing this say twenty years ago you know,\\" we can evaluate the hypothesis \\"but why did we not do this in the past\\" to determine if its validity aligns with any of the given options. Option 1 asserts that the hypothesis is true. The premise itself raises the question of why a certain action or approach was not taken in the past, aligning with the hypothesis' intent to investigate the reasons for not using a particular method or solution earlier. There could be various reasons why something was not done in the past, such as limited resources, lack of knowledge, technological barriers, or social and cultural constraints. Acknowledging these factors and understanding how they have evolved over time can help us draw a link between the premise and the hypothesis. Therefore, in this context, we can conclude that there is evidence supporting the hypothesis' truth. Option 2 claims that it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is true. While unclear situations and lack of information might sometimes prevent us from drawing definitive conclusions, the given premise already questions why a certain thing was not done in the past. This expressed curiosity allows us to infer that there is, at least to some degree, a basis for the hypothesis' investigation. Thus, this option appears to carry less weight in the context of the question. Option 3 proposes that the hypothesis is not true. This option would be more applicable if there was evidence contradicting the hypothesis or indicating that the action, method, or solution in question had already been implemented twenty years ago. However, the premise itself is centered on understanding why something was not done in the past, which aligns with the hypothesis rather than refutes it. As a result, this option does not seem relevant to the question. In conclusion, based on the premise “but how come we weren't doing this say twenty years ago you know,” it is reasonable to assert that the hypothesis \\"but why did we not do this in the past\\" is true. Various factors and circumstances could have prevented the implementation of an idea or solution in the past, and understanding these can help to establish the hypothesis' validity.

However, fatty acids can also interact with other molecules such as sodium and glucose in various biological processes. - Sodium: Fatty acids can combine with sodium to form soap in a process called saponification, wherein the carboxylic acid group of the fatty acid reacts with a strong base, like sodium hydroxide, to produce a sodium salt of the fatty acid.    - Glucose: Fatty acids can be indirectly associated with glucose through metabolic pathways. In the process of metabolism, glucose can be converted into fatty acids or broken down into smaller molecules to generate energy. Similarly, when the body needs energy and glucose levels are low, it can break down stored fatty acids for energy production. The other options mentioned, such as carbon dioxide, fuel cells, uranium, and energy, do not directly combine with fatty acids in a chemical sense.  - Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of cellular respiration and not a molecule that combines with fatty acids.  - Fuel cells are devices that convert chemical energy into electricity, and while they may utilize substances produced by the breakdown of fatty acids, they do not combine with fatty acids directly. - Uranium is a radioactive element used as fuel in nuclear power plants and is not involved in fatty acid chemistry or metabolism. - Energy is a property that can be released or absorbed during the chemical reactions involving fatty acids but cannot be combined with them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

VINE Transit (an acronym for Valley Intercity Neighborhood Express.) is a public transportation service in Napa County, California, United States; it is managed under the Napa Valley Transportation Authority and operated by Transdev. The system offers extensive service throughout the County along with providing connections to other public transportation systems in adjacent counties. Can we draw the following conclusion? VINE Transit is operated by Napa Valley Transportation Authority.","output":"The given information states that VINE Transit is managed under the Napa Valley Transportation Authority and operated by Transdev.

Instead, it can be said that the Napa Valley Transportation Authority oversees and manages the VINE Transit system, while Transdev serves as the operator responsible for handling the day-to-day operations of the transit system. To provide a more detailed perspective on the roles of these organizations in relation to VINE Transit, it is essential to look at the responsibilities and functions associated with each entity. The Napa Valley Transportation Authority (NVTA) serves as the managing organization for VINE Transit and is responsible for a range of tasks associated with the transit system. This includes, but is not limited to: 1. Planning and development: NVTA creates long-term strategies and plans for improving and expanding the VINE Transit system in order to meet the public transportation needs of Napa County. 2. Policy-making and governance: NVTA establishes policies and regulations related to the functioning and operations of VINE Transit. This can include matters like fare structures, service hours, and operational guidelines. 3. Funding and budgeting: NVTA oversees the allocation of financial resources for VINE Transit, ensuring the transit system receives the necessary funding to provide safe, reliable, and efficient services to Napa County residents. 4. Monitoring and oversight: NVTA is responsible for tracking the performance and effectiveness of VINE Transit, ensuring that the system is meeting its goals and staying in compliance with established policies and regulations. On the other hand, Transdev is the contracted operator of VINE Transit, responsible for the day-to-day operations of the public transportation service. This means that Transdev handles tasks such as: 1. Staffing and training: Transdev is responsible for employing and training the personnel who drive vehicles, maintain the fleet, and provide support services for VINE Transit. 2. Maintenance and fleet management: Transdev ensures that vehicles are properly maintained and kept in good condition, following the guidelines established by the NVTA to provide safe and reliable transportation services. 3. Scheduling and dispatching: Transdev works on creating the transit schedules, coordinating the services and routes, and managing the dispatch of vehicles in order to efficiently serve the passengers and meet their transportation needs. 4. Customer service and public relations: Transdev communicates with passengers, addresses grievances and concerns, and provides information and updates related to the VINE Transit services. In conclusion, while both the Napa Valley Transportation Authority and Transdev are involved in the operations of the VINE Transit, each organization has its unique roles and responsibilities. The NVTA serves as the managing entity, overseeing the functioning and performance of the VINE Transit system, whereas Transdev is the contracted operator responsible for handling the day-to-day operations. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that VINE Transit is operated by the Napa Valley Transportation Authority, as the direct operation is the responsibility of Transdev."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite.

His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\".

After the water is drained for the second time, the dishwasher uses one of two methods to dry the dishes: heated drying or fan-assisted drying. In heated drying, an electric heating element at the bottom of the dishwasher raises the temperature inside the appliance. The hot air evaporates the remaining moisture on the dishes, and the steam generated is then vented out, leaving the dishes dry. In fan-assisted drying, a fan circulates the air inside the dishwasher, promoting evaporation and speeding up the drying process. Some models may also use a heat exchanger to raise the air temperature, further enhancing the drying efficiency. Finally, when the drying cycle is complete, the dishwasher signals that it's ready for the dishes to be unloaded, and the entire process is finished."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: Who assigned the man who would later use the Chac Mool as a motif the pointing machine assignment? is inside the article: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., can you guess it ?","output":"In the given article, it is mentioned that during an exercise set by Derwent Wood, the professor of sculpture at the Royal College, Henry Moore was assigned the task of using the pointing machine. Derwent Wood asked Moore to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modeling the relief in plaster and then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine.\\" However, Moore chose to carve the relief directly, deviating from the traditional method and consequently conflicting with the academic tutors. This incident reflects Moore's inclination towards modern approaches, showing his familiarity with primitivism and the influence of prominent sculptors like Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, and Frank Dobson.  As a result, it can be deduced that Derwent Wood, the professor of sculpture at the Royal College, assigned the pointing machine assignment to Henry Moore, who would later use the Chac Mool as a motif."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Step 1: Research about Somali National Alliance and Battle of Mogadishu To answer this question, I will first gather information about the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu to understand their contexts, backgrounds, and significance in history. Step 2: Identify the connection between Somali National Alliance and Battle of Mogadishu After researching the relevant information, I will identify potential connections between the two subjects to determine their specific relationship. I will focus on key events, people, and goals associated with both the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu. Step 3: Explain the relationship between the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu In the final step, I will organize the information I've gathered to clearly present the relationship between the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu, highlighting significant events and key points that connect the two topics. --- After completing these steps, my answer is: The Somali National Alliance (SNA) and the Battle of Mogadishu are related in that the SNA was one of the key factions involved in the Battle of Mogadishu, which took place in Somalia in 1993. The SNA was a political and military alliance, led by General Mohamed Farrah Aidid, and consisted of various Somali factions that opposed the presence of the United Nations and US troops in the country. The Battle of Mogadishu was a significant event in Operation Restore Hope, a humanitarian mission led by the United Nations to provide assistance and establish order in the war-torn Somalia. The battle was a result of an attempt by United States Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers to capture Aidid's high-ranking lieutenants. The operation met heavy resistance from the SNA and local militias, and the battle lasted for two days, resulting in numerous casualties on both sides. In conclusion, the relationship between the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu exists because the SNA, as an opposing faction, played a major role in the conflict that unfolded during the battle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is the second suspect to be charged over the killing, which caused an outcry in Chicago. Corey Morgan, 27 - said to be one of two men who lured Lee from a playground - was arrested in November. On Tuesday a prosecutor said the murder was symptomatic of an \\"unprecedented crisis\\" of gang violence in the city. More than 450 people were killed in Chicago in 2015. The city police department faced intense criticism and a murder charge for one of its officers over the shooting of a 17-year-old black teenager Laquan McDonald. Police says Boone-Doty was being held on unrelated gun charges when investigators linked him to the child's death. Then-Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy described the shooting as the \\"most abhorrent, cowardly, unfathomable crime\\" he had ever seen. Police officials and prosecutors echoed that language on Tuesday. \\"In my nearly 30 years of policing, I have never witnessed such a hateful act of treachery,\\" said Police Superintendent John Escalante. State's Attorney Anita Alverez said Boone-Doty had been looking for family members to kill - including Tyshawn's grandmother - as part of escalating gang retribution.

David Bruce Vitter (born May 3, 1961) is an American lobbyist, lawyer and politician who served as United States Senator for Louisiana from 2005 to 2017. He was the first Republican elected to the Senate from his state since the Reconstruction Era. Previously, he served in the United States House of Representatives, representing the suburban Louisiana's 1st congressional district. He served as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives before entering the U.S. House. Vitter has been actively involved with legislation concerning illegal immigrants. In June 2007, he led a group of conservative Senators in blocking federal Immigration Legislation that would have granted a pathway to legal residence to 12 million illegal immigrants coupled with increased border enforcement. The bill's defeat won Vitter national attention as the bill was supported by President George W. Bush, John McCain, and Ted Kennedy, among others. Vitter characterized the bill as amnesty, which supporters denied. Bush accused the bill's opponents of fear mongering.  In October 2007, Vitter introduced an amendment withholding Community Oriented Policing Services funds from any sanctuary city which bans city employees and police officers from asking people about their immigration status in violation of the Illegal Immigration Act. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, in opposition to the amendment, said these cities do not want to inquire about someone's status if they report a crime, are a victim of domestic violence or get vaccinations for their children. The amendment was defeated.  In November 2007, Vitter introduced a bill requiring banks to verify that no customer was an illegal immigrant before issuing banking or credit cards. The bill never made it out of committee.  In March 2008, Vitter reintroduced the latter two proposals and cosponsored ten of eleven other bills in a Republican package of tough immigration enforcement measures including jail time for illegal border crossing; deportation for any immigrant (legal or illegal) for a single driving while intoxicated; declaration of English as the official language (thereby terminating language assistance at voting booths and federal agencies)' additional construction of a border fence; permission for local and state police to enforce immigration laws and penalties for states who issue drivers licenses to illegals. None of these proposals passed, partially because the Democratic-controlled Senate preferred a comprehensive approach which would include a guest-worker program and a path to citizenship for the current population more akin to the package defeated by Vitter in 2007.  In April 2008, Vitter introduced a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that a child born in the United States is not a citizen unless a parent is a citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien serving in the military. Currently the Constitution grants citizenship to children born within the U.S. regardless of the legal status of the parents. The bill never made it out of the Democratic-led committee.

Before that, he also worked as a helper for other people living in Louisiana in the House of Representatives, another group that makes decisions for the USA. David Vitter was very interested in making rules about people who come from other countries and live in the United States without permission. In 2007, he stopped a big idea that would have allowed many of these people to live in the United States legally. Many important people wanted this idea to become a rule, but David Vitter said it was like giving away a reward for doing something wrong. Other people disagreed with him, but he won that fight. David Vitter also tried to make many other rules to control people coming to the United States without permission. He wanted all children born in the United States to only become American citizens if their parents were already citizens or had permission to live in the United States.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Evolution of the Horse. The fossil record reveals how horses evolved.   Q: What can be looked at to see a record of how horses evolved?   A: The answer is:","output":"The fossil record can be looked at to see a record of how horses evolved. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of animals, plants, and other organisms from the past, which have been embedded within layers of sedimentary rock and soil. These formations provide crucial evidence for understanding the development of life on Earth, as they offer a window into the natural history of organisms that lived millions of years ago. In the case of horse evolution, studying the fossil record provides valuable insight into the various stages horses went through as they adapted to changes in their environment and biological pressures. By analyzing the fossils, scientists can observe changes in horse anatomy, including the gradual transformation of their teeth, limbs, and overall size. This information contributes significantly to our understanding of the evolutionary process of horses. The horse's evolutionary journey is believed to have started around 55 million years ago with a small, multi-toed creature called Hyracotherium or Eohippus. Over time, as climate and ecological conditions changed, these early horses diversified and adapted to different environments, giving rise to various branches of the horse family tree. One of the most notable evolutionary changes in horses is the reduction of the number of toes. Early horses had four toes on their front feet and three on their rear feet, which provided better traction and mobility in the soft, swampy environments they initially inhabited. As grasslands replaced forests and softer ground, horses evolved to have a single hoofed toe, making them better suited to run fast on hard terrain. This characteristic can be observed in the modern horse, which possesses only one toe on each foot. Another striking feature that can be seen in the horse fossil record is the change in tooth structure. Early horses had simple, low-crowned teeth that were well-adapted for browsing on soft leaves and shrubs. However, as their diet shifted to grazing on grasses, horse teeth evolved into high-crowned molars with complex ridges, which allowed them to break down the tough, fibrous plant material more efficiently. Moreover, the fossil record also reveals a gradual increase in horse body size over time. Early horse ancestors were small, about the size of a dog, but as they adapted to various habitats and food sources, they grew larger to cover greater distances efficiently, and to compete better for resources with other species. In summary, by examining the fossil record, researchers can gain substantial knowledge about the evolution of horses. This includes observing changes in their anatomy, such as the number of toes, tooth structure, and overall size, as well as understanding how these modifications were influenced by changes in climate, diet, and ecological conditions. The fossil record serves as a rich source of information that allows us to piece together the fascinating evolutionary journey of horses and their adaptations throughout history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While walking by Minnie Mouse's house one day, Mickey Mouse is enticed by the aroma of a cake Minnie is baking. Promised a slice if he cleans the yard, Mickey immediately jumps into raking up the fall leaves littering Minnie's lawn. While working in the yard, a small tornado as tall as Mickey comes along and makes his work more complicated: first the youngster hops into the basket and leaps over Mickey countless times before he pounds the basket in place, shaking it to check if it's snared. After he throws the leaves in, the child pounces on him, spins him around, grabs his hat, and taunts him. Angered, Mickey pounces on the youngster, who spins him around and scoots away, leaving Mickey's hat on his head. Both Mickey and the youngster have a tug'o'war on the basket until it shatters on Mickey, who is entangled. Then, the child makes an army of leaves and marches around the house. Mickey manages to trap the child with a sack, which he ties and punts away. The tornadoling retaliates with just 2 punches, then attempts to get away, with Mickey hot on his heels. As Mickey chases him with a rake the terrified child calls out for help. The mother tornado, unamused with Mickey tormenting her offspring (and unaware of what her child has been doing to Mickey), furiously pursues him with a look of relentlessness on her face.

Write highlights for this article: The UK economy has shaken off the European crisis with growth figures that outshine its G7 peers. It is expected to grow 3.1% this year, according to a forecast by the prestigious EY ITEM Club, above earlier expectations of 2.9%. The growth is well above that expected of Germany, Europe's biggest economy and one which dragged the bloc out of crisis, at 1.8%. \\"We have moved from the recovery phase to expansion. And furthermore, it's looking very durable,\\" said Peter Spencer, professor of Economics and Finance at University of York and chief economic adviser to the ITEM Club. Figures released Friday show the British economy passing the pre-crisis peak from 2008, with second quarter of growth of 0.8%. Spencer said the growth is no longer financed by people tapping into their savings -- as was the case this time last year -- but by business expansion and a stronger labor market. Business spending is on the rise, meaning companies are investing into production rather than sitting on cash. Business investment by itself now generates more than half of the UK's growth. The government is trumpeting a record-high employment -- 73.1% of people were in work in the three months to May, matching up the previous record-high from 2004/2005. But there is a catch. While record numbers of Brits are working, their wages are growing at the slowest rate on record -- and at about half of the inflation rate. That fuels another problem of the UK's economy -- the chronic and rising inequality. Of all UK households, only the highest earning 20% increased their disposable income last year. The remaining 80% of households suffered a drop in their income, numbers released by the Office of National Statistics show. The Bank of England has also warned that the UK productivity has been \\"extremely and uncharacteristically weak\\" since the recession. Productivity growth, which indicates if the economy can produce more for less, remains below the pre-crisis levels, at 16%. Many economists are also warning the UK about a potential housing bubble. The average cost of a home in the UK is now 20% above the pre-crisis peak in 2007. The IMF has already warned the UK government that rising house prices and low productivity could hinder the economic growth and urged the country to put in place \\"early measures\\" to prevent housing bubble. But Spencer told CNN the fears of a bubble were overblown. \\"This is not driven by mortgage borrowing. In London for example, it's mainly cash buying and overseas buyers,\\" he said, pointing to relatively flat mortgage borrowing. The UK is also vulnerable to shocks from outside. Half of the country's international trade is with the European Union countries, many of which are still suffering from the consequences of the eurozone crisis. \\"If Germany takes a hit, we'll suffer too. If Germany does well, we'll do well, like the rest of Europe,\\" Spencer said.

Context: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

It only mentions one incident, which is important but not the crux of the story. In the warehouse, several events unfold. Firstly, Judith Grey, who has been keeping a watch on the Toyland Warehouse, enters the building but is eventually arrested for trespassing. This suggests that she is suspicious of the toys' activities and is determined to uncover the truth behind them. Secondly, a bum breaks into the warehouse and accidentally revives the demonic toys, including Baby Oopsie Daisy, Jack Attack, Mr. Static, and Zombietoid. These killer toys eventually force the new security guard, Ray Vernon, to assist them in fulfilling their needs. In addition to this, the main characters, Brick Bardo and Nurse Ginger, team up with Judith to locate and eliminate the toys. They venture back to the warehouse to accomplish this mission. Thus, although the death of the bum is indeed an event that occurs in the warehouse, it is only one of the many significant happenings contributing to the overall narrative.

Eventually, Brick Bardo, Nurse Ginger, and Judith return to the warehouse to confront and destroy the toys.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.
