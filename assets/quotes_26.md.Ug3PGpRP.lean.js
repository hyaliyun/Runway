Answer the following question: Question: when slavery abolished I found the following answer on Google: While some slaves worked as house servants and urban artisans, the great majority worked on plantations or large farms, cultivating lucrative cash crops, such as rice, tobacco, sugar and, after 1800, chiefly cotton. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google is not a correct answer to the question about when slavery was abolished. The information provided in the answer is referring to the types of labor that slaves were involved in, such as working as house servants, urban artisans, and on plantations or large farms cultivating cash crops like rice, tobacco, sugar, and cotton. This information is relevant to the conditions and types of work that slaves were subjected to, but it does not address the timeline of the abolition of slavery. To answer your question correctly, we need to focus on the key events and dates related to the abolition of slavery in various regions and countries around the world: 1. United States: The abolition of slavery in the United States occurred on December 6, 1865, when the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified. The amendment states, \\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\\" It is important to note that the Emancipation Proclamation, signed by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate states, but it was the 13th Amendment that formally abolished slavery throughout the entire country. 2. United Kingdom: The Slavery Abolition Act was passed on August 28, 1833, and came into effect on August 1, 1834. This act legally ended slavery in the British Empire, which included a wide range of territories, such as the Caribbean, Mauritius, and the Cape of Good Hope (present-day South Africa). 3. France: The first abolition of slavery in France took place in 1794, during the French Revolution. However, it was reinstated by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. The second and final abolition of slavery occurred on April 27, 1848, when the French National Assembly declared the immediate abolition of slavery in all French colonies. 4. Brazil: Brazil was the last nation in the Americas to abolish slavery. The \\"Golden Law\\" (Lei Áurea) was signed by Princess Isabel on May 13, 1888. This law declared the end of slavery in Brazil without any compensation to slave owners. 5. Other countries and regions also abolished slavery throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, in most Spanish American countries, slavery was banned between 1810 and 1825 as they gained independence from Spain. In conclusion, the answer you found on Google does not correctly address the question of when slavery was abolished. The correct answer would focus on the actual dates and events that led to the abolition of slavery in various countries and regions throughout history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Look for words like \\"For Sensitive Skin\\" and \\"Moisturizing.\\" When you shower or bathe, it's best to stick with just lukewarm water. Hot water can dry out skin even more. You can use a physical exfoliant, such as a pumice stone or a foot file. Near the end of your shower or bath, gently scrape your feet with the file or pumice. You can also do it after your bath if you prefer.  Another option is to use a liquid foot scrub that is designed to exfoliate. Rub it on in the shower and wash it off.  Some people have had good luck with a foot soak of 1 part Listerine, 1 part vinegar, and 2 parts warm water. Soak your feet in it for 20 minutes. However, you'll likely still need to use a physical exfoliant. Apply a lotion after you bathe or shower. Showering and bathing can dry out your skin, but applying lotion locks in the moisture that showers leave behind. If you think your cuticles don't look pretty, try paying special attention to them when you're rubbing in moisturizer. Gently massage each edge of your cuticle with cream. If your regular lotions aren't cutting it, it's fine to use an oil-based lotion on your feet. You can also just use plain petroleum jelly. These types of creams are too heavy for places like your face, but they can help out severely dry areas like cracked heels. It's also helpful to put on cream when you go to bed.

Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.  Now, I have a new situation: Reed started studying protozoa and was more interested in the predatorial behaviors of protozoa, while Brad wanted to know more about other types of protozoa, suck as grazers and decomposers.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York.  - Biotechnology is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or \\"any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use\\" (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Art. 2). Depending on the tools and applications, it often overlaps with the (related) fields of bioengineering, biomedical engineering, biomanufacturing, molecular engineering, etc.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by land area and the 9th least populous of the 50 United States.  - Dayton (local pronunciation: ) is the sixth-largest city in the U.S. state of Ohio and is the county seat of Montgomery County. A small portion of the city extends into Greene County. In the 2010 census, the population was 141,527, and the Dayton metropolitan area had 799,232 residents, making it Ohio's fourth-largest metropolitan area, after Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus and the 63rd-largest in the United States.

Dayton is within Ohio's Miami Valley region, just north of the CincinnatiNorthern Kentucky metropolitan area.  - Lo-fi music (from the term \\"low fidelity\\") is lower quality of sound recordings than the usual standard for modern music. The term was adopted in late 1986 by WFMU DJ William Berger, who dedicated a weekly half-hour segment of his program to home recorded music under the name Lo-Fi.  - Dinosaur Jr. is an American rock band formed in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1984, originally simply called Dinosaur until legal issues forced a change in name.  - The Freed Man is the debut album by Sebadoh (Lou Barlow and Eric Gaffney). The title refers to the Friedman Complex apartments at Smith College where Lou Barlow was living with his then-girlfriend Kathleen Billus. As Barlow says in the liner notes, \\"... we named our first co-headlining tape after the Friedman dormitory where we both were living against regulations, with our girlfriends on the Smith (all women's) College campus ..\\"  - Boston (pronounced ) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. Boston is also the seat of Suffolk County, although the county government was disbanded on July 1, 1999. The city proper covers with an estimated population of 667,137 in 2015, making it the largest city in New England and the 23rd most populous city in the United States. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.7 million people in 2014 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country. Alternately, as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.1 million people, making it the sixth-largest as such in the United States.  - Homestead Records was a Long Island, New York-based sublabel of music distributor Dutch East India Trading. It was founded in 1984 by Sam Berger, who was the American independent buyer for Dutch East India Trading. Berger was finding that many bands who had perhaps released their own first 45 were having difficulty coming up with the finances to press followups. He was able to convince the owner of the company to press and distribute records for bands that already had recorded an album, and have the bands supply the artwork. It is considered instrumental in launching the post-hardcore and noise rock genres. When Berger left to work with Midnight Records, he recommended 18-year-old Gerard Cosloy, whom he knew from Boston and who published a fanzine that Homestead distributed. Cosloy went on to sign many of the notable acts. Cosloy was succeeded by Ken Katkin and later by Steven Joerg. The label's last release was Ivo Perelman's \\"Cama de terra\\" in 1996.  - WFMU is a listener-supported, independent community radio station headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, broadcasting at 91.1 (at 90.1 as WMFU, and at 91.9 as W219DQ) MHz FM, presenting a freeform radio format. It is the longest-running freeform radio station in the U.S. The station is licensed to the city of East Orange, New Jersey, and its terrestrial transmitter is located in West Orange. It can be heard worldwide on the internet.  - Deep Wound was an American hardcore punk band formed in 1982 in Westfield, Massachusetts.

It was released by Homestead Records in 1991.  - The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Weed Forestin is an album by the American indie rock band, Sebadoh. It was originally self-released by Barlow on cassette in 1987, under the Sentridoh name, the solo home-recording project of American rock musician and Sebadoh member Lou Barlow, and sold at record stores in his native Massachusetts in an approximate run of 100.   - Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement.   - Bloomington is a city in and the county seat of Monroe County in the southern region of the U.S. state of Indiana. It is the seventh-largest city in Indiana and the fourth-largest outside the Indianapolis metropolitan area. According to the Monroe County History Center, Bloomington is known as the \\"Gateway to Scenic Southern Indiana.\\" The city was established in 1818 by a group of settlers from Kentucky, Tennessee, the Carolinas and Virginia who were so impressed with \\"a haven of blooms\\" that they called it Bloomington.  - Robert Pollard (born Robert Ellsworth Pollard Jr. on October 31, 1957) is an American rock musician and singer-songwriter who is the leader and creative force behind indie rock group Guided by Voices. In addition to his work with Guided by Voices, he continues to have a prolific solo career with 21 solo albums released so far.  - Louis Knox Barlow (born July 17, 1966) is an American alternative rock musician and songwriter. A founding member of the groups Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh and The Folk Implosion, Barlow is credited with helping to pioneer the lo-fi style of rock music in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His first band, in Amherst, Massachusetts, was Deep Wound. Barlow was born in Dayton, Ohio and was raised in Jackson, Michigan and Westfield, Massachusetts.  - Sebadoh ( / sbdo / ) is an American indie rock band , currently signed with Joyful Noise Recordings . Sebadoh were formed in 1988 in Northampton , Massachusetts , by Eric Gaffney and Dinosaur Jr bass player Lou Barlow . Along with such bands as Pavement and Guided by Voices , Sebadoh helped pioneer lo - fi music , a style of indie rock characterized by low - fidelity recording techniques , often on four - track machines . The band 's early output , such as 1990 's The Freed Man and Weed Forestin ' and 1991 's Sebadoh III , was typical of this style . After a 14 - year recording hiatus , during which time members pursued other projects while occasionally touring as Sebadoh , the group returned in 2013 with the Secret EP and a full - length album titled Defend Yourself , which were both self - recorded . Lead singer Lou Barlow says of the band 's resurrected sound , \`\` We kept to ourselves during the recording and did n't have much , if any , outside intervention . That , to my mind , makes it a true Sebadoh record and aligns the style of Defend Yourself with our early releases . ''  - Joyful Noise Recordings is an independent record label from Indianapolis, Indiana. The label was founded in 2003 in Bloomington, Indiana by Karl Hofstetter, who also played drums on many of the label's first releases. Joyful Noise currently has a roster of 20+ bands of various musical styles, though according to the label, each artist \\"in one way or another bridges this gap between pop and noise.\\" Along with housing offices and the warehouse of the label, their Fountain Square location hosts live shows and a small record store.   - Guided by Voices (often abbreviated as GBV) is an American indie rock band originating from Dayton, Ohio. It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter Robert Pollard.  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.

Ask a question about Richard Feynman.","output":"What was Richard Feynman's contribution to the development of quantum mechanics, and how did it impact the scientific community? Richard Feynman was an American theoretical physicist, who is primarily known for his work in the field of quantum mechanics. Born in 1918 in New York City, he went on to become one of the most influential figures in 20th-century science. Feynman made numerous important contributions to the development and understanding of quantum mechanics, most notably his development of the path integral formulation and diagrammatic representation, which are now referred to as Feynman diagrams. Path Integral Formulation: Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics provided an alternative to the existing matrix and wave formulations of the time and aided in understanding complex quantum phenomena. It offered a unique perspective to quantum mechanics by describing how particles, such as electrons and photons, do not follow a single trajectory in space-time but simultaneously follow an infinite number of paths. The path integral approach calculates particle behavior by considering the quantum amplitude, or probability, of every possible path taken by the particle from its initial to the final state. This approach led physicists to a more clear understanding of quantum mechanical behavior and helped provide a natural description of several physical phenomena, such as quantum tunneling and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Feynman Diagrams: Another seminal contribution of Richard Feynman to the field of quantum mechanics was the development of the diagrammatic representation technique known as Feynman diagrams. These diagrams were conceived as a concise and intuitive way to represent the complex calculations and interactions involved in quantum field theory. By employing visual elements such as lines and vertices, Feynman diagrams enabled scientists to systematically account for particle interactions, such as emission, absorption, or exchange of particles, in an organized manner. This method greatly simplified calculations in particle physics and high-energy physics, by reducing the mathematical complexity of the interactions involved. Feynman diagrams became the standard tool for depicting processes in quantum electrodynamics (QED) and eventually found applications in other areas of particle physics, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the electroweak theory. Impact on the Scientific Community: Richard Feynman's contributions to quantum mechanics had profound effects on the scientific community. The innovative path integral formulation not only offered new methods to describe and analyze quantum phenomena but also facilitated connections between quantum mechanics and other branches of physics, such as classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, and string theory. This approach expanded the scope of quantum mechanics and led to advancements in several other research fields. Feynman diagrams became an essential tool for physicists working in the areas of quantum field theory and particle physics, enabling the development of the Standard Model of particle physics. This revolutionary method of representing particle interactions not only simplified calculations but also offered a more profound understanding of the underlying processes. Throughout his career, Feynman made several other major contributions to science, such as his work on the Manhattan Project during World War II and his investigation of the Challenger space shuttle disaster. Feynman's contributions have truly left an indelible mark on the understanding and advancement of quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, making him one of the most distinguished scientists of the modern age. His charisma, unique teaching style, and affinity for problem-solving have made him an inspiration to generations of scientists and students alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Parenting a child was natural for Cynthia but not Jennifer because","output":"Cynthia grew up in a close-knit family, surrounded by love, care, and nurturing. It was her family's bond and values that ingrained in her the wisdom and instincts necessary for being an effective parent. Cynthia was always very close to her mother, who was a great role model for her. She admired her mother's strength, compassion, and ability to juggle various responsibilities with grace. With time, Cynthia developed a profound understanding of what was required to raise a child successfully. While growing up, Cynthia often found herself taking care of her younger siblings, which gave her hands-on experience in understanding a child's needs. This experience made her empathetic and attentive, equipping her with the ability to anticipate potential challenges a child might face. Moreover, Cynthia had natural leadership qualities and was a skilled problem-solver. As a result, she proved to be an excellent negotiator when it came to helping her siblings navigate their emotions and conflicts. On the other hand, Jennifer grew up in a very different environment. She was an only child, and her parents were often busy with their demanding careers, leaving her independent from a very young age. Jennifer did not have the same kind of support and guidance that Cynthia received, which made it challenging for her to cultivate the necessary skills to excel at parenting naturally. Jennifer's parents did their best to provide for her, but they were not always available to actively teach her the nuances of parenting. As she grew up, Jennifer focused more on her education and career and did not have the opportunity to observe or engage in parenting interactions closely. Consequently, Jennifer lacked the exposure and confidence that Cynthia possessed when it came to nurturing a child. Furthermore, Jennifer had limited exposure to various aspects of child development, such as behavioral patterns, emotional intelligence, and effective communication. This lack of understanding made it hard for her to naturally tackle challenges that came with parenting. Given their contrasting backgrounds, Cynthia's natural inclination towards parenting stemmed from her strong family values, close relationships with her mother and siblings, and her practical experiences in providing care and guidance to her younger siblings. On the other hand, Jennifer, who did not have similar experiences, found it difficult to adapt to the role of a parent seamlessly. However, Jennifer's struggles with parenting did not mean that she was incapable of being a good mother. Understanding her weaknesses, Jennifer took it upon herself to learn and grow as a parent. She attended parenting workshops, read books, and surrounded herself with positive influences to acquire essential knowledge and skills. Through determination and perseverance, Jennifer slowly but steadily gained the confidence and ability to become a loving and nurturing parent. In conclusion, the individual upbringing and life experiences of Cynthia and Jennifer played a significant role in shaping their natural aptitude towards parenting. While Cynthia's background offered her hands-on experiences in nurturing and caring for children, Jennifer's circumstances led her to develop parenting skills later in life. Nevertheless, both Cynthia and Jennifer were dedicated to becoming the best parents they could be, which is a testament to their love and commitment to their children."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \\"Chief\\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.

It serves as an outlet for the river Akerselva. Since the 2000s, it has been undergoing urban redevelopment, being transformed from a container port. When completed, the Bjørvika neighborhood will be a new cultural and urban center in Oslo. The multi-purpose medium-rises of the Barcode Project is nearing its completion to the north; to the east the residential area of Sørenga is under construction. The National Opera is located at Bjørvika, and both the Oslo Public Library and the Munch/Stenersen museum is currently under construction here, the latter replacing the existing Munch Museum in 2020.   - Akerselva or Akerselven ( English : Aker River ) is a river which flows through Oslo . It starts at Maridalsvannet in Oslomarka , and follows the urban areas Nordre Aker , Sagene , Grünerløkka , Oslo centre and Grønland , whereby it finally ends at Paulsenkaien and Oset in Bjørvika . The river is considered to be a part of the Nordmarkvassdraget , and has the watercourse number 006.Z . The entire river is about 8.2 kilometres ( 5.1 mi ) long , and has a difference in elevation between source and mouth of approximately 149 metres ( 489 ft ) .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select the topic that this about: We are born to run. According to new research, our bodies are highly evolved for running long distances, an ability that allowed our ancestors to conquer the African savannahs.","output":"The topic of this discussion revolves around the notion that humans are naturally adapted and evolved for long-distance running. This idea is backed by recent research which suggests that our bodies have developed unique characteristics over time, enabling our ancestors to thrive in the African savannahs. Such evolutionary adaptations allowed early humans to outrun their prey, secure resources, and ultimately expand their territories. In the following paragraphs, we will delve deeper into the biological, scientific, and historical aspects that support this idea, as well as discussing its implications for modern-day human health and fitness. One of the main distinguishing characteristics of humans in comparison to other primates, is our bipedal locomotion. Our ancestors developed an upright posture and the ability to walk on two legs, freeing up our hands to manipulate objects, create tools, and engage in complex social behaviors. Bipedalism was an evolutionarily advantageous characteristic because it allowed our ancestors to cover vast distances more energy-efficiently. In addition to bipedalism, the human body exhibits other unique adaptations that are specifically designed to support long-distance running. For example, the ability to dissipate heat through sweating is one such adaptation. This cooling mechanism, which is more efficient in humans than in most other mammals, prevents our bodies from overheating during extended periods of physical activity, such as running. Another significant adaptation is the presence of a large Achilles tendon, which stores and releases energy during running, acting as a spring for each stride. This tendon, along with other elastic elements in our legs, enables us to conserve energy while running, and is a key component of our endurance capabilities. The nuchal ligament is another characteristic feature that supports our ability to run long distances. Found at the base of the skull, this ligament stabilizes the head during running, preventing it from bobbing up and down and helping us maintain a clear line of vision. This, in turn, allows for better navigation and awareness of our surroundings while in motion. Our ancestors, particularly Homo erectus and early members of the Homo sapiens species, relied heavily on persistence hunting, a technique that involved chasing prey over long distances until the animal became exhausted. Early humans lacked the physical strength of predators like lions or the speed of a cheetah but made up for it with their incredible endurance. Persistence hunting favored individuals with the physiological capacity to run long distances, leading to the selection of these traits in succeeding generations. The physiological benefits of endurance running can also be seen in the mental aspect of human development. Long-distance running has been proven to stimulate the production of endorphins, also known as the \\"feel-good\\" hormones, reducing stress and promoting overall well-being. In addition, the ability to maintain focus and mental clarity during long runs would have been essential for our ancestors in tracking and outsmarting prey. These evolutionary adaptations still hold significance in the modern era. Today, many people participate in long-distance running events like marathons or practice endurance sports for personal fitness and mental health benefits. Moreover, the idea that humans are inherently \\"born to run\\" may alter the way people view physical activity and wellness, potentially encouraging a more active lifestyle for those who embrace this notion. In conclusion, the compelling evidence supporting the idea that humans are born to run offers fascinating insights into our evolutionary history. Our unique physiological adaptations for long-distance running have not only provided us with a means to survive and thrive in challenging environments, but they have also shaped our mental and emotional well-being. By exploring and appreciating these evolutionary traits, we can better understand our inherent potential for physical endurance and its continuing relevance to modern human life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His eagerness to escape might affect his physical movements. 2. The technician regained consciousness: This part of the premise suggests that the technician was previously unconscious or not fully conscious. Regaining consciousness might imply that he had recently experienced some physical or mental strain, which could impact his balance and stability. 3. The technician jumped on his feet: This action demonstrates that the technician got up quickly and urgently, likely driven by his desire to escape into tomorrow. This sudden movement can lead to unsteadiness, especially if the person was not fully conscious or experienced a recent strain. 4. The technician's feet were not all that stable: This statement directly addresses the technician's physical stability. It suggests that his feet were not providing adequate support and balance, making it more difficult for him to avoid stumbling or falling. Taking all these components into account, we can deduce that the technician was attempting to quickly stand and escape a situation, but his stability was compromised partly due to regaining consciousness, the urgency to escape, and the possible physical or mental strain experienced before becoming unconscious. This unsteadiness accurately aligns with the hypothesis \\"The technician was having trouble keeping his balance.\\" Therefore, given the detailed explanation of the premise, it is reasonable to conclude that it does entail the hypothesis \\"The technician was having trouble keeping his balance.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Seeking to cement the celebrations with a grand show at the Colosseum, Caesar instructs the head of a prominent Gladiator School, Caius Fatuous, to ensure that the Circus Maximus is a success, promising to make him the wealthiest man in Rome, or the main attraction of the show if he fails. While discussing about the many gifts he has received from his Empire, Caius knows that one province hasn't, since it has yet to be conquered - a small village in Gaul. In the village at the same time, Asterix begins to notice his friend Obelix acting strangely, following the return of the chief's niece, Panacea. When Druid Getafix sees him become tongue-tied when talking with her, he reveals that Obelix has fallen in love with her. When Asterix sees that he is still infatuated with her the next day, he quickly suggests that his friend heads out for flowers to impress her. However, upon returning with a bouquet for Panacea, his heart is quickly broken when he sees her reunite with the recently returned Tragicomix, a handsome, young man whom Chief Vitalstatistix reveals will be soon marrying Panacea. Seeking to spend more time together following their reunion, the two lovers venture out into the nearby woods, but are swiftly ambushed and captured by a group of Romans, led by a fresh recruit hoping to make a good impression of himself with his Centurion, the head of a nearby garrison.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Ellis, son of Edward Peppen Ellis and Susannah Mary Wheatley, was born in Croydon, Surrey (now part of Greater London). He had four sisters, none of whom married. His father was a sea captain, his mother the daughter of a sea captain, and many other relatives lived on or near the sea. When he was seven his father took him on one of his voyages, during which they called at Sydney, Callao and Antwerp. After his return, Ellis attended the French and German College near Wimbledon, and afterward attended a school in Mitcham.  In April 1875, Ellis sailed on his father's ship for Australia; soon after his arrival in Sydney, he obtained a position as a master at a private school. After the discovery of his lack of training, he was fired and became a tutor for a family living a few miles from Carcoar. He spent a year there and then obtained a position as a master at a grammar school in Grafton. The headmaster had died and Ellis carried on the school for that year, but was unsuccessful.  At the end of the year, he returned to Sydney and, after three months' training, was given charge of two government part-time elementary schools, one at Sparkes Creek, near Scone, New South Wales and the other at Junction Creek. He lived at the school house on Sparkes Creek for a year. He wrote in his autobiography, \\"In Australia, I gained health of body, I attained peace of soul, my life task was revealed to me, I was able to decide on a professional vocation, I became an artist in literature these five points covered the whole activity of my life in the world. Some of them I should doubtless have reached without the aid of the Australian environment, scarcely all, and most of them I could never have achieved so completely if chance had not cast me into the solitude of the Liverpool Range.\\" What family did he tutor for?","output":"Havelock Ellis was a tutor for a family living a few miles from Carcoar in Australia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Atkins, was also a member of the Church of God In Christ, and a youth counselor, before he died in 2013.  Due to their proximity in age, the two sisters grew up closer to one another than to any of their siblings: Darrell Atkins (born 1965, the only living boy- the second boy died as a child), Maliea Atkins (born 1967), Erica (born 1972), Tina (born 1974), Delisa Atkins-Brown (born 1977), Thomasina Atkins (born 1979), Alana Atkins-Jamison (born 1985), and Shanta Atkins (born 1986). Later, they would work creatively with over half of their siblings; Thomasina, Alana, Delisa and Shanta Atkins all sing background on Mary Mary's albums and during stage performances and Delisa was originally a member of the group but left before they started recording professionally due to pursuing college. Eventually, all eight Atkins children united on the Bobby Jones Gospel show on BET.

The answer is:","output":"The temperature in the atmosphere drops. The justification for the step is as follows:  Firstly, before the water can be in the air to form tiny ice crystals, it's important that the temperature conditions in the atmosphere are conducive, which involves the temperature dropping below freezing. This is typically how the water vapor in the air turns into ice crystals. When the temperature drops below the freezing point, the water vapor in the air cools down and condenses to form tiny ice crystals. This is a crucial first step before the ice crystals can collide and stick together in order to form snowflakes. Without this temperature drop, the process of forming snowflakes would not commence.

Brazil government wins appeal in tax dispute with Vale highest court overturned an injunction that had suspended collection of disputed tax claims from Vale SA , the world's largest iron-ore producer, the company said on Thursday, adding it would appeal the ruling. The miner is fighting four tax bills issued by the federal tax authority, totaling 30.5 billion reals (15.83 billion) on its earnings abroad. Vale said this is tantamount to double taxation as it paid taxes to foreign governments. The Superior Court of Justice ruled in favor of the federal tax authority in its appeal against an injunction granted in March that suspended payment of the taxes by Vale. Vale says it will now appeal in order to reinstate that suspension. \\"Vale remains confident in its arguments and will continue to pursue all appropriate legal actions until a final decision on the merits is reached,\\" it said in a statement. A statement on the court's website confirmed that the company still had the right to appeal the decision.

My father built it near the Suwannee River. I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet. Question: What is probably true about the author?

I walk in and in the first cubicle I could see lots and lots of blood on the floor and a pair of feet placed as if he was sitting down.

I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay.

First, we need to find out the total of \\"-52*u\\", \\"-171*u\\" and \\"-15*u\\". These three can be added together because they all share the same \\"u\\", just like if you had 52 apples, 171 apples, and 15 apples, you could add them all together to find out how many apples you had in total.  Now, if we add -52, -171, and -15 together, we will get -238. So our equation is now \\"4046 = -238*u\\".  Now, we want to find the value of \\"u\\". To do that, we can imagine that we are sharing 4046 candies equally into 238 baskets (assuming that we can divide candies down to the smallest bit). Each basket will represent the value of \\"u\\". Finally, we divide 4046 by -238. When you divide a positive number by a negative number, the answer will be negative.  So, after doing the division, we find out that \\"u\\" is approximately equal to -17.  Just like if you divided 4046 candies equally into 238 baskets, each basket would have about -17 candies.

A high school cheerleader whose dad secretly filmed her in her bedroom and the bathroom has revealed that she has forgiven him - and even encouraged her mother not to file for a divorce. Michaela Smith, from Pell City, Alabama, was just 15 when she saw a red flashing light between her trophies in her bedroom in April 2011 and realized it was a camera. Investigations revealed that her father, Michael Smith, had filmed her on four separate occasions and stashed the images on his computer. He was jailed for a year. Now Michaela, who is 18, has spoken out as she receives the Bryant-Jordan Student-Athlete Achievement Award, which honors student-athletes who have overcome hardship, on Monday. Ordeal: Michaela Smith, a high school cheerleader in Alabama, has said she forgives her father for recording her in her bedroom and in the bathroom - a crime that saw him locked up for a year. Even though she was initially distraught that her father had recorded her, she said she has since learned to forgive him because the experience has allowed her to help other victims. 'I lost my innocence that day,' Michaela, who does not believe in sex before marriage, told AL.com. 'I realize it was horrible but it was a necessary price. in order to help my father and to use this experience to help others. That sacrifice has created positive changes in so many other people.' Now that he has been in prison, he realizes what he has done wrong, she said. 'Sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom. for us to make a change and that is what happened to my father,' she. said. 'I am so thankful for the year he spent in prison because it truly. saved his life.' Michaela also described her horror when she changed from her church clothes into a more comfortable t-shirt - and saw the camera flashing. Her mother was also in the room and said she immediately feared the worst, but tried to cover up her bad thoughts, for Michaela's sake. Support: Her mother Rhonda, left, walked out on her father when they discovered he had been filming Michaela, but she has not divorced him and they still attend the same church. 'I said something like I put it up there while I was cleaning and didn't know how to shut it off,' Rhonda said. 'I didn't want to worry her.' But she told her other daughter, Janet, who asked a friend adept at computer forensics for help and pictures of Michaela were later found on her father's computer. He was arrested in April 2011 and indicted the following November. 'This man was supposed to protect me from all the bad in the world,' Michaela said. 'He put that camera in my room and had been using it to look at me for months. I've never felt so destroyed.' Ahead of the incident - when her mother was struggling to cope with her father's drinking - Michaela had told her mother that she didn't want her to get a divorce. 'Families are supposed to stick together,' she said. 'Marriages are not easy. A man and wife should stay together. They made a promise to God. There is always counseling and help if things get bad.' But her mother wishes she had stayed with her gut instinct and divorced him. Still, she remains married to him and they attend the same church. Forgiving: Michaela said that she realizes her father had hit rock bottom and is aware of how much he hurt their family. She said she is thankful for the incident because it has allowed her to help other victims. Moving on: Michaela, pictured with fellow cheerleaders, missed a lot of school amid the stress of the case but has maintained a solid GPA and now hopes to attend Auburn following her senior year. Michaela said she never blamed her mother for staying with her father, calling her 'the best thing in my world'. As the case dragged on, Michaela struggled to eat or sleep and rarely attended school. Her father had been bailed out by wealthy relatives, and she lived in fear she would see him. After her father was sentenced, she started therapy and realized that she could take her bad experiences and use them to help others at church groups, youth groups and after school. Her father was released from prison last March but if he tries to speak with her, he will be sent back. This arrangement could change with Michaela's consent - but she said she is not ready yet. He told AL.com that he had long struggled with an addicted to pornography and regretted how it had destroyed his family. He said he had not watched it since his wife and daughter left him three years ago. His daughter said she is now looking forward to attending Auburn and perhaps studying social work.","output":"This story is about a girl named Michaela Smith who found out that her father secretly filmed her in her bedroom and bathroom.

Question: Process:  - Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter - The overall planet is hotter.  suppose Making meat illegal happens, how will it affect MORE global warming.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"Making meat illegal would indirectly impact the steps of the global warming process. Here's an in-depth explanation of how this comes into play. Global warming primarily occurs when the Earth's atmosphere traps heat radiating from the planet's surface, due to greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Greenhouse gases have the ability to absorb and emit infrared radiation, which increases the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. The production of meat, particularly from livestock such as cattle, pigs, and chickens, contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to multiple factors, including: 1. Methane Emissions: Ruminant animals like cows and sheep produce methane during digestion through a process called enteric fermentation. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, around 28 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. 2. Deforestation: To create space for livestock farming and the cultivation of crops used as animal feed, vast areas of forests have been cut down. Deforestation contributes to the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. 3. Manure Management: Animal manure emits greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide and methane. Nitrous oxide, in particular, is approximately 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. 4. Fossil Fuels: The production of meat requires considerable energy for purposes like animal feed production, heating, and cooling livestock buildings, as well as the transportation and processing of meat products which contribute to the carbon dioxide emissions. By making meat illegal, various indirect consequences would affect the global warming process: 1. Lower Methane Emissions: If meat production were to be banned, there would be a significant reduction in the number of livestock, thus reducing methane emissions from enteric fermentation. 2. Reduced Deforestation: The elimination of meat production would decrease the demand for agricultural land dedicated to livestock and animal feed crops, reducing deforestation rates and allowing forests to thrive and absorb more carbon dioxide. 3. Better Manure Management: A decrease in livestock numbers would lead to reduced manure production, which in turn, would lower nitrous oxide and methane emissions from manure management systems. 4. Decreased Fossil Fuel Usage: Banning meat production would mean fewer resources would be spent on livestock production processes, reducing fossil fuel consumption and associated carbon dioxide emissions. In conclusion, making meat illegal would indirectly impact the global warming process by influencing multiple factors contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Although this action would not have a direct impact on any specific step in the global warming process, it would lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Battles are periodically fought between fighter spacecraft, and no human pilot hates the Dracs more than Willis E. Davidge (Dennis Quaid). During one such battle, Davidge and Drac pilot Jeriba Shigan (Louis Gossett, Jr.) engage in a dogfight which results in both crash-landing on Fyrine IV, an alien world uninhabited by intelligent life, with two moons, a breathable atmosphere, water, native fauna, and a hostile environment. After initial hostilities, the two eventually learn to cooperate to survive. They work together to build a shelter for protection against meteorite storms, a natural phenomenon that periodically strikes the planet. Over the next three years, they overcome their differences, become friends and learn each other's languages and cultures. Each saves the other's life several times. Davidge, haunted by dreams of spaceships landing on the planet, leaves in search of help. He finds evidence of humans, but learns that the planet has only been periodically visited by human miners known as \\"Scavengers\\", who use Dracs as slave labor. He returns to warn Jeriba, (nicknamed \\"Jerry\\"), only to discover that Jeriba is pregnant. It is revealed that Dracs reproduce asexually. A blizzard and an attack by an indigenous predator forces Davidge and Jeriba to flee their shelter. To pass the time Jeriba teaches Davidge his full lineage. Jeriba later slowly dies in childbirth, but not before making Davidge swear to take the child back to the Drac homeworld and recite his full ancestry, so that he can join Drac society. Davidge raises the child Zammis (Bumper Robinson).

Regardless of the specific context, the detonation would generate a sequence of catastrophic consequences, as discussed below. 1. Blast damage: Upon impact, the explosive force from the simultaneous detonation of two warheads would first demolish structures and infrastructures. The blast radius could span several kilometers, with buildings being flattened or severely damaged. The destruction would also extend to bridges, roads, and other crucial transport links. 2. Thermal radiation: The explosion would release an immense amount of thermal radiation, affecting a vast area. Objects and people within proximity would be instantaneously vaporized, while individuals farther from the epicenter would experience severe burns and blisters. In addition, the extreme heat would ignite wildfires, causing widespread devastation. 3. Electromagnetic pulse (EMP): The detonation of two nuclear warheads would emit a powerful EMP, which could overload and damage electrical and electronic devices within a considerable radius. Communication, transportation, and power systems would be impaired, causing widespread blackouts and compromising essential services. 4. Radiation: People exposed to the immediate nuclear radiation risk acute poisoning, which could cause rapid illness or death. Additionally, the affected areas would be contaminated with radioactive fallout, rendering them unsafe for habitation or agriculture for extended periods. 5. Environmental consequences: The nuclear detonation would produce a dust cloud with millions of tonnes of particulate matter, which could block sunlight temporarily and cause a drop in regional temperatures. This phenomenon, known as a nuclear winter, could lead to crop failures and famine, endangering ecosystems and human lives. Now, let's address the second part of your query: \\"Are ATM services back to normal?\\" This question seems to be unrelated to the consequences of nuclear warhead impact. Given the context of a nuclear event, it is essential to emphasize that the aftermath would severely disrupt everyday services, including banking systems. ATMs would likely not function due to power outages, loss of communication channels, and destruction within the affected region. Recovery could take an extended period, and the resumption of essential services like ATM functioning would depend on the scale of the disaster, infrastructure restoration, and communication network repair. In conclusion, the two questions do not have the same meaning and pertain to different scenarios. The first question sheds light on the catastrophic consequences of two nukes impacting, while the second question discusses the restoration of ATM services, which would be severely compromised in the aftermath of a nuclear detonation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By modding your console, you can play backed-up games without having to purchase them, thus saving money and expanding your gaming library. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to mod your Xbox 360, find the right torrent file for the backup you want to download, and play your burned game. Please note that modding your Xbox 360 and downloading unofficial game backups may be against the terms of service of your console and could void your warranty. Also, be aware that sharing copyrighted material (including game files) can be illegal. Proceed with this guide at your own discretion. Step 1: Modding Your Xbox 360 Before you can play backed-up games on your Xbox 360, you'll need to modify your console. You can either do this by installing a custom firmware or using a hardware modchip. There are numerous tutorials available online that can guide you through the process, or you can seek the help of a professional modder. Step 2: Finding a Torrent File for the Backup You Want to Download Once your Xbox 360 is modded, the next step is to find the right torrent file for the backup you want to download. You can do this by searching on websites that host torrent files, such as The Pirate Bay or Kickass Torrents. When searching for a game, make sure to download a version that's compatible with your Xbox 360's region and mod type. Step 3: Downloading ABGX360 To ensure that your downloaded game will work correctly on your modded Xbox 360 and to minimize the risk of running into issues, you will need to use a software called ABGX360 to patch the game files. You can download ABGX360 from the official website (http://abgx360.net).

The software will then patch the game to ensure it's compatible with your modded Xbox 360. Remember to follow the instructions on ABGX360's website to ensure a successful patch. Step 5: Downloading ImgBurn Next, you will need a software called ImgBurn to create a .DVD file from the patched game and burn it onto a blank DVD-R. You can download ImgBurn from the official website (https://www.imgburn.com). Step 6: Opening the .DVD File in ImgBurn With ImgBurn installed, open the software, and choose the \\"Write image file to disc\\" option.

Step 7: Configuring ImgBurn settings Before you start burning the game, click on \\"Tools\\" in the menu bar and then select \\"Settings.\\" Ensure that the write settings are configured correctly for burning Xbox 360 games. If you are unsure of which settings to use, consult ImgBurn's official forums or other online resources. Step 8: Inserting a Blank DVD-R and Starting the Burn Process Insert a blank DVD-R into your computer's DVD drive. Make sure to use a high-quality DVD-R to minimize the risk of burn errors. In ImgBurn, select the appropriate drive, and start the burn process. It's a good idea to lower the write speed to ensure a more reliable burn. Step 9: Playing Your Burned Game Once the burn process is complete, insert your newly burned DVD-R into your modded Xbox 360 and start playing! If everything has been done correctly, the game should load and play just like an original copy. Conclusion By following this guide, you can successfully mod your Xbox 360, find and download a torrent file for the game you want to play, patch it using ABGX360, and burn the game onto a blank DVD-R using ImgBurn.

The uncertainty stems from the use of the word \\"might,\\" which implies that the new job is not a sure thing yet. 5. Sentiment conclusion: After assessing the various emotional components, the sentiment embodied by the tweet can be described as cautiously hopeful. The individual is excited about the possibility of starting a new job but remains aware that the opportunity is not yet guaranteed. This combination of hope and uncertainty evokes a sense of cautious optimism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: What is Max's first public school? Movie plot title: Rushmore Movie plot: Max Fischer (Schwartzman), an eccentric 15-year-old, is a scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, a private school in Houston. He is both Rushmore's most extracurricularly active and least scholarly student. He spends nearly all of his time on elaborate extracurricular activities, not at all bothered how it affects his grades. He also has a feud with the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim. Herman Blume (Murray) is a disillusioned industrialist who finds his operation of a multimillion-dollar company to be tedious. He is upset that his marriage is failing and the two sons he's putting through Rushmore are impolite and obnoxious brats spoiled by their mother. Herman comes to like Max, and the two become good friends. Max is proud of Herman's success while Herman is interested by Max's arrogant persona. Rosemary Cross (Williams) is a widowed teacher who arrives at Rushmore as a new first grade instructor. She joined Rushmore after the death of her husband, who was also a former Rushmore student. Max quickly develops an obsession with Rosemary and makes many attempts at pursuing her. While she initially tolerates Max, Rosemary becomes increasingly worried by his obvious infatuation with her. Along the way, Blume attempts to convince Max that Rosemary is not worth the trouble, only to fall for Rosemary himself. The two begin dating without Max's knowledge. After Max attempts to break ground on an aquarium without the school's approval, he is expelled from Rushmore. He is then forced to enroll in his first public school, Grover Cleveland High. Max's attempts to engage in outside activities at his new school have mixed results. A fellow student, Margaret Yang, tries to befriend Max, but he acts hostile towards her. Rosemary and Blume attempt to support him in his new school. Eventually, Max's friend Dirk discovers the relationship between Rosemary and Blume and informs Max as payback for a rumor Max started about his mother. Max and Blume go from being friends to mortal enemies, and they engage in back-and-forth...

He was somewhere on a dark road, possibly driving to Richmond to kill his former in-laws.      That’s when Valentine went on Facebook and started broadcasting live.      “She lied on me, had warrants taken out on me,” he told the camera early Tuesday, as he divided his gaze between the phone and the road. “She drug me all the way down to nothing. I loved my wife, but she deserved what she had coming.”      In his chilling Facebook livestream, which was later reposted on YouTube, Valentine acknowledged that the violent chain of events he started could end in his own death.      “Pleasure knowing all y’all,” he said. “I’ve been very sick for months. And this is something that I could not help. So I don’t know if I’m gonna make it where I’m going, but if I don’t, I wish all of you a good life.”      [Pregnant woman executed for refusing abortion, family says]      Police in Norlina, a town of 1,100 people just south of the North Carolina-Virginia state line, spent Tuesday and Wednesday trying to unravel what caused Valentine allegedly to kick in the door of his ex-wife’s single-story home and open fire — and then admit to the crime on social media.      But more than anything, they wanted to find Earl Valentine.      Authorities from the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service joined local and regional law enforcement agencies in a manhunt stretching from Virginia to South Carolina, Norlina Police Chief Taylor Bartholomew told The Washington Post on Wednesday afternoon.      Within hours, authorities located Valentine at a motel in Columbia, S.C., about 280 miles south of Norlina.      Officials said Valentine committed suicide after being surrounded. He was pronounced dead at the scene.      “He shot himself in the head,” Bartholomew told CBS affiliate WLTX. “Think he felt the pressure of being surrounded by marshals. He died alone. At the end of the day, he is a coward.”      A man who bragged about killing his wife & teen son was found at the Days Inn on Plumbers Rd in Richland Co. pic.twitter.com/tEgyyjJbz8 — Van Lott (@VanWLTX) September 8, 2016      Hours earlier, Bartholomew said he had talked to Valentine on the phone; the Norlina police chief described the suspected killer as “cold and callous,” saying he showed no remorse for the shootings.      “For somebody that had just done something like that, he was calm but he was aggressive,” Bartholomew told The Post on Wednesday. “He was trying to pump me for information. His main focus was to make sure his ex-wife was dead.”      Bartholomew quoted Valentine as saying that he wouldn’t be taken alive and that he planned to kill his in-laws, then himself.      Police said later that Valentine drove to Richmond after killing his son and injuring his ex-wife, then turned around and drove south, to Columbia.      Keisha Valentine and her teenage son had moved to Norlina nearly nine months ago to get away from her abusive ex-husband, Bartholomew said.      She was granted a year-long domestic violence restraining order, but it expired last month. The police chief said there’s evidence that Earl Valentine had exchanged heated words with his ex-wife’s family on Facebook.      Still, it’s unclear what prompted Tuesday morning’s assault on Hyco Street.      [A man beat a 7-month-old girl to death after finding out he wasn’t her father, prosecutor says]      About 1:30 a.m., Earl Valentine burst through the front door of the house and marched to his ex-wife’s bedroom, Bartholomew said. Keisha Valentine leaned against the door, trying to keep him out, but he managed to shoot her anyway.      Their son, awakened by the commotion, confronted his father. But the teenager fell to the floor and was shot in the chest.      Before he died, he called police and told them what had happened.      If he had been captured alive, Earl Valentine faced a first-degree murder charge in his son’s death, Bartholomew said.      Since Facebook Live launched in April, millions have used the service to offer a glimpse into the big moments and small details of their lives.      The view isn’t always pretty.      Earl Valentine is the latest example of a person using Facebook Live to discuss a violent act — or to showcase the act itself.      In June, Larossi Abballa, a terrorism suspect accused of killing a French police captain and his partner in their home, broadcast the aftermath of the attack on Facebook Live. An occasionally tearful Abballa, speaking a mix of French and Arabic, swore allegiance to the Islamic State militant group and encouraged others to follow his example and kill police.      A month later, a Georgia mother went on her daughter’s Facebook account to broadcast herself beating the teenager — punishment for posting sexually explicit pictures on the site.      “This is my page now,” Shanavia Miller told the camera after she fixed her hair. “Now I’m gonna need y’all to send this viral. Please share this because I’m not done. More to come.”      A July shooting in Norfolk that injured three men was inadvertently captured on Facebook Live. In the video, three men are sitting in a car, smoking and listening to rap music. Five minutes into the video, there’s a series of 30 gunshots.      And after police in Minnesota fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop in July, his girlfriend opened Facebook and began livestreaming the aftermath. The video was viewed millions of times, sparking outrage and widespread protests.      The nascent live-streaming service is raising philosophical questions about the power of unfiltered Internet video that can reach millions instantly.      As The Post’s Caitlin Dewey wrote in July:      Facebook Live, which launched globally in April, has quickly emerged as one of the Internet’s dominant platforms for streaming unfiltered, real-time video. As Facebook has learned in the past week, however, that status comes with unique challenges. Real-time video is exceedingly difficult to moderate, as it reaches its largest audience instantaneously and can be redacted only after that moment of impact. That limits the power of even a dedicated, 24-7 moderation team, which Facebook Live has. Despite growing concern that the tool could be abused — several shootings, a police standoff and an accused jihadist’s confession have streamed on Facebook already — the company has remained intentionally (and characteristically) vague on the composition and guidelines of its moderation team.      1 of 17 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × 17 shocking crime stories from 2016 View Photos A beloved mayor in Fairfax faced allegations of a meth-for-sex scheme, and a man (successfully) used a “the-stop-smoking-pill-made-me-do-it” defense after shooting his wife.

(WNCN) – A Warren County man wanted after shooting his ex-wife and then his 15-year-old son in the chest was found dead in South Carolina from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.      The shooting incident happened on Tuesday around 1:30 a.m. at a home located at 403 Hyco St. in Norlina.      Police say Earl Valentine kicked in the back door of his ex-wife’s house and shot her, then his son in the chest. The 15-year-old boy, who called 911, died while talking to the operator. Keisha Valentine, his ex-wife, is in critical, but stable condition.      “I’ve been in law enforcement 20 years and I’ve never seen anything like this this guy is bragging about it on social media. No remorse whatsoever. When we spoke to him on the phone he told us he is basically armed and dangerous,” Norlina Police Chief Taylor Bartholomew said.      Keisha Valentine and her son moved to Norlina from the Charlotte area to escape Earl Valentine’s abuse, Bartholomew said. A restraining order against Earl Valentine expired last month.      Earl Valentine posted a Facebook Live video where he admitted to the shooting.      “What’s up everybody? I just killed my (expletive) wife,” Valentine said in part of the video. “I don’t feel no (expletive) remorse for what I did.”      Bartholomew said he has been in contact with Earl Valentine by phone, but his phone has now been turned off.      “He shot his own son. And for me and my guys? It’s hard to wrap your brain around that. We’re pretty angry about it especially the way he’s acting over it,” Bartholomew said.      At the time of the phone calls, police say the suspect was believed to be in the Richmond area. Police say they tracked him to Richmond then to Columbia, SC where the U.S. Marshals Service found Valentine in a motel on Wednesday.      The marshals found Valentine dead when they went into the room, according to police.      Keisha Valentine underwent surgery Wednesday for wounds to her chest.      She has a bullet near her spine, Bartholomew said.      Keisha Valentine has not been able to speak but she is aware.

Answer:","output":"The priory where Roger de Birthorpe was imprisoned for trespass after a raid was located in the country of England.  To provide a comprehensive understanding of the matter, let us delve deeper into the historical context and the events that led to Roger de Birthorpe's imprisonment. Roger de Birthorpe was a 14th-century Lincolnshire gentleman who became associated with a group of men involved in criminal activities, specifically cattle and horse theft. This group was active in the late 14th and early 15th centuries and raided different properties in the region, often including religious establishments. During one of these raids, Roger de Birthorpe and his accomplices trespassed and committed multiple thefts against a priory. The priory in question was most likely a religious institution belonging to the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, also known as the Knights Hospitaller, who were prevalent in England, specifically around Lincolnshire, during this era. It is important to understand that a priory is a type of monastery headed by a prior or prioress, which can be part of a larger organization such as an abbey. Religious establishments, like priories and abbeys, were influential centers of both religious and secular life during the Middle Ages and were often prosperous and powerful. The exact location of the priory where Roger de Birthorpe was imprisoned is not entirely clear since no specific priory is mentioned in the historical records about his case. However, given the prevalence of religious establishments in the England of that era, it would not be surprising to find various priories in the Lincolnshire area where de Birthorpe's group could have conducted their criminal activities and trespasses. After his capture, Roger de Birthorpe was charged and found guilty of trespassing and theft. As a result, he was imprisoned in the priory, which was not an uncommon punishment for minor crimes at that time. It was believed that the religious environment might encourage the criminals to repent for their misdeeds. In conclusion, Roger de Birthorpe was a 14th-century Englishman involved in criminal activities who was imprisoned at a priory in England, specifically the region of Lincolnshire. The exact location of the priory remains uncertain, but it was likely one of the several religious establishments associated with the Order of St. John of Jerusalem during this era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately, my experience watching \\"Falling Star\\" left me with a profound sense of disappointment. Despite a promising premise, the film failed to deliver on multiple levels. First and foremost, the plot was poorly developed and riddled with inconsistencies. The story revolves around the lead character, Tom, who aspires to become a renowned astronomer despite numerous obstacles. While this concept initially intrigued me, the execution turned out to be bland and predictable. The film's climax, intended to be a game-changing revelation, was obvious within the first 30 minutes. Moreover, some elements felt entirely disjointed, with irrelevant subplots diluting the central theme. The lack of character development further hindered my ability to connect with the story. Tom, played by Michael Jameson, had a surface-level personality that felt two-dimensional. This issue was exacerbated by the palpable lack of chemistry between Jameson and his co-star, Isabella Bernard, who portrayed Tom's love interest, Lucy. Despite multiple attempts, their on-screen relationship never appeared genuine, making it difficult to root for their characters. Moreover, \\"Falling Star\\" was visually underwhelming. The production quality was mediocre, with unsophisticated cinematography that left much to be desired. Even the locations and sets felt uninspired, which is tremendously disappointing considering the potential to explore celestial themes. The film's astronomical backdrop could have easily lent itself to captivating visuals, but instead, the director chose mundane settings. Lastly, the dialogue was stilted and unnatural, causing numerous cringe-worthy moments. Characters frequently delivered monologues that felt more like exposition than genuine interactions. The script could have benefited significantly from revisions and more nuance, lending itself to a greater emotional impact. In summary, \\"Falling Star\\" is a regrettable misfire in terms of storytelling, character development, visuals, and dialogue. This once-promising concept was ultimately bogged down by its poor execution. I'd recommend skipping this film in favor of a brighter cinematic gem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose wife wants a roast duck for dinner? ?  The cartoon begins with Mr. Meek carrying an axe in his hands. He turns to the audience and explains that his wife, Sweetypuss, told him that if he didn't bring home a roast duck for dinner, she would 'cook (his) goose'. (A parody of Wallace Wimple and his wife \\"Sweetie Face\\".) The scene cuts to Daffy eating corn while singing \\"I Dream of Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\" minding his business. A shadow of Meek is show getting ready to chop off Daffy's head. Then he jumps and shouts \\"WATCH IT, BUB!!!\\" directly in his face. After a brief talk to Meek, he flicks his beak at his face and marches to a hay stack. Meek chops the stack various times and on the last chop, he thinks he kills the duck. Daffy fakes his death by squirting ketchup and throwing his feathers around (\\"You crushed my little head!\\") This fools Meek by pretending he is beheaded and runs rapidly. Meek feels sad and goes back to his house, where Daffy is seen putting lots of sugar cubes into a cup of coffee. Meek guiltily tells him that he has killed a duck. Daffy cheers up Meek into giving him a cup of coffee and asks how many lumps (of sugar) his wife usually gives him. Meek shows Daffy a 'lump' (a bump on his head), and Daffy hits him on the head (giving him another 'lump') and pours cream on it. Daffy dances on the cakes and pies, singing \\"Shortening Bread\\", and Meek immediately recognizes the duck he thought he killed (\\"Say. That's that Daffy Duck.\\") Daffy then utters 'YOU AIN'T JUST WHISTLING DIXIE!!!', then throws a pie at him, leading into a war between himself and Meek. Daffy goes into army plane mode, by dropping an egg on Meek as a \\"Secret Bomb Site.\\" Next, he goes into battle weaponry mode, by making various sounds and smashing household items. After all the fun and games are over, Meek gets mad, which causes the egg to fry on his head.

They both were among the best in the school.  Which person read more about humidity?  Hint: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.

The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort.

Fisher?","output":"The domestic appliance invented in 1901 by Alva J. Fisher is the electric washing machine, specifically the \\"Thor\\" washing machine. Alva J. Fisher, an American engineer and inventor, recognized the need for a more efficient and convenient method for cleaning clothes, as the existing methods were predominantly manual and labor-intensive. This led him to develop a groundbreaking appliance that would revolutionize the way people did their laundry. The Thor washing machine, named after the Norse god of thunder, was the world's first electric washing machine and was patented by Fisher on August 9, 1904 (U.S. Patent No. 966,677). Initially, the patent covered a washing machine with electric motor components, and Fisher later added to the patent the improvements and several design features that catered to the convenience of users. The Hurley Machine Company of Chicago, Illinois started manufacturing the Thor washing machines in 1908, making this innovative device available to the general public. The original Thor washing machine was a drum-based design that consisted of a galvanized metal tub mounted on wooden legs. The tub had several small holes for water circulation and drainage, and it was equipped with a reversible electric motor. The motor powered a system of gears that turned the tub at a controlled speed, creating agitation to clean the clothes inside. This innovative design effectively replaced the manual scrubbing and washing that was commonly used at that time. One of the key features that made Fisher's invention revolutionary was the capability to reverse the motor's direction, allowing the tub to change its rotation direction. This feature helped to eliminate excess wear and tear on the motor and tub, thereby increasing the machine's longevity. Additionally, the use of an electric motor instead of manual labor made the laundry process significantly more convenient and less time-consuming. Despite its initial high cost, which made it a luxury item for many households, the Thor washing machine helped pave the way for a wide range of home appliances that would gradually evolve and become more affordable over the years. These advancements would, in turn, transform the way people performed household chores, enabling them to devote more time to other pursuits. In conclusion, the electric washing machine, specifically the \\"Thor\\" washing machine, was invented in 1901 by Alva J. Fisher. This revolutionary invention not only improved laundry cleaning efficiency but also marked the beginning of a new era of electric-powered domestic appliances.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do you clean a statue?","output":"Cleaning a statue requires careful determination in selecting the right cleaning supplies, techniques, and protecting the statue to preserve its longevity. The complexity of the task depends heavily on the type of material the statue is made of and the intricacy of the designs. Here are two proposed solutions to clean a statue: Solution 1: Professional Conservation  If the statue is a costly art piece, an antique, or has significant historical or sentimental value, it is recommended to consult with a professional conservator. These professionals have specialized training in the care and preservation of artistic and historic objects. They can assess the state of the statue, identify the type of material it is made from, and establish the correct cleaning procedure it requires.  The conservators will usually perform a series of tests on inconspicuous areas to ascertain the safest means of cleaning. They might utilize specific equipment (like lasers) or chemicals that aren't usually available to the general public. The conservator will not only clean the statue but also provide guidelines about how to maintain it, considering the statue's patina or intended aged look, which might be appealing for some and should be preserved.  Solution 2: DIY Cleaning For less valuable statues, a DIY approach can be sufficient. You just need to make sure you understand the material the statue is made from - wood, marble, brass, bronze, etc. Each type of material requires a specific cleaning technique. For instance, if it’s a brass statue, soapy warm water, a soft cloth, and brass cleaner are sufficient. Additional efforts may be needed if patina has formed. A marble statue often requires a gentler method involving a pH-neutral stone soap and warm water. Wooden statues need dry cleaning methods because water can cause swelling and deformation of the statue.  Regardless of the material, it's crucial to be as gentle as possible. Use soft brushes (like the ones used for watercolor) to remove loose dirt. For more substantial dirt or residue, the gentle use of a toothbrush might help. Remember to always dry the statue after cleaning to avoid any water damage or stains. In conclusion, the optimal solution depends on the statue's value (monetary or sentimental) and the owner's resources and ability. In general, professional conservation is the best approach for high-value statues since professionals have the right skills, knowledge, and equipment to handle intricate cleaning tasks. General maintenance or cleaning can be done by the owner, but only if it involves minimum risk and uses appropriate and gentle cleaning methods. If you are unsure, it is best to seek advice from professionals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bond kills a test subject, and later the \\"real\\" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud. While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd systematically kill several diamond smugglers, M suspects that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping, and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse. At the airport Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter, then travels to Las Vegas.

Question: \\"Who could be relied on to read detailed documentation?\\"  Context: \\"With the onset of the Crusades in 1095, and the expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), Jewish migration pushed eastward into Poland (10th century), Lithuania (10th century), and Russia (12th century). Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \\"usurious\\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Individuals who could be relied on to read detailed documentation during the time of the Crusades and subsequent Jewish migration into Eastern Europe were likely educated Jewish merchants, scholars, and community leaders. This is because of several factors that contributed to the high literacy rates and strong business networks among the Jewish population during these centuries. First, one of the key reasons for the strong focus on trade and business management was the Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews. These restrictions limited the types of work Jews could engage in, leading them to specialize in trade, finance, and other areas that were not prohibited. Second, there was a widespread emphasis on male education within the Jewish community. Nearly all Jewish males received an education, primarily focusing on religious studies and commandments (known as the Torah and Talmud). This education fostered a culture of literacy and, by extension, the capability to read and understand detailed documentation. Third, the ability of Jewish merchants to rely upon and trust their family members living in different regions and countries was crucial for maintaining their business networks. Jewish communities were connected by a shared language (Yiddish), religious practices, and social customs, which facilitated communication and trust between community members both locally and across international borders. Therefore, family members and other community members in prominent positions would have been relied upon to read and understand detailed documentation relating to trade, finance, or other essential matters. In conclusion, the educated Jewish merchants, scholars, and community leaders were the ones who could be relied upon to read detailed documentation during the time of the Crusades and the following centuries of Jewish migration into Eastern Europe. Their literacy rates and strong connection to a broader network of trusted individuals enabled them to manage trade, business, and financial matters effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment.  Question: suppose less muscles available happens, how will it affect more scouring of rocks occurs.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Acid rain is a significant environmental concern resulting from human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial processes that release harmful chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), into the atmosphere. These chemicals then react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form acidic compounds, including sulfuric acid and nitric acid. As these compounds precipitate and fall to the ground as acid rain, a series of interconnected consequences follows. The question you are asking essentially refers to a perturbation in the amount of muscle available, seemingly in the context of the scouring of rocks. However, the process of rock scouring is not directly tied to the availability of muscles or muscle power and is primarily a result of the corrosive effects of acid rain itself. So, we will first explore the acid rain phenomenon and how it is related to rock scouring. When acid rain falls to the ground, it can have several detrimental effects on the environment, including the accelerated weathering and erosion of rocks. The acid rain gradually weakens the chemical bonds within rocks, causing them to break down more quickly than they would under normal conditions. This scouring effect is particularly prominent in susceptible rock types, such as limestone and marble, which contain significant amounts of calcium carbonate that readily reacts with the acids in the rain. As rocks are scoured and eroded by acid rain, the surrounding vegetation also faces destruction. The increased acidity of the soil makes it difficult for many plants to extract vital nutrients, leading to a decline in plant health and, in extreme cases, widespread deforestation. This lack of vegetation, in turn, destabilizes the surrounding environment, as plants typically play crucial roles in soil stability, nutrient cycling, and providing habitat for other species. Now, considering the proposed scenario of less muscle availability, it is essential to clarify that the scouring of rocks by acid rain is primarily a chemical process, not one directly influenced by muscular force or work. As such, any perturbation in muscle availability would not have a direct impact on the rate at which acid rain scours rocks. Instead, the critical factors influencing the severity of acid rain's effects on rocks and the environment include the concentration of acidic compounds in the rain, the sensitivity of local rock types, and the buffering capacity of the soil and surrounding watershed. Given the lack of a direct relationship between muscle availability and the scouring of rocks by acid rain, it is reasonable to conclude that the supposed perturbation would have no effect on this environmental process. The more important focus for mitigating the impacts of acid rain would be to address the underlying sources of the pollutants that are driving this harmful cycle, such as reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants and other industrial processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a recently minted term; previously gentilic was recorded in English dictionaries, e.g., the \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" and \\"Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary\\".  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life.  - The Flemish Region ( Dutch : Vlaams Gewest ; French : Région flamande ) is one of the three official regions of the Kingdom of Belgium -- alongside the Walloon Region and the Brussels - Capital Region . Colloquially , it is usually simply referred to as Flanders . It occupies the northern part of Belgium and covers an area of 13,522 km2 ( 44.29 % of Belgium ) . It is one of the most densely populated regions of Europe with around 470 inhabitants per square kilometer .  - Belgians are the citizens and natives of the Kingdom of Belgium, a federal state in Western Europe.  - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - Belgium is a federal state comprising three communities, three regions, and four language areas. For each of these subdivision types, the subdivisions together make up the entire country; in other words, the types overlap.  - Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the region of Flanders (in which it forms an enclave) or Wallonia. The region has a population of 1.2 million and a metropolitan area with a population of over 1.8 million, the largest in Belgium.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.  - Western Europe, also West Europe, is the region comprising the western part of the European continent. There may be differences between the geopolitical and purely geographic definitions of the term.  - In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated ) is a describing word, the main syntactic role of which is to qualify a noun or noun phrase, giving more information about the object signified.  - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.

Q:I can use this background: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels.  Now, I have a new situation: The blood vessels of two different people are being studied at a laboratory. Jim's blood vessels are narrowing, and Bob's blood vessels are widening. This information alone doesn't tell the scientists much about Jim and Bob so they will need to run more tests to see if there are issues with the blood.  Answer this question please: Is the amount of blood flowing through Bob's blood vessels increasing or decreasing? A:","output":"The amount of blood flowing through Bob's blood vessels is increasing. This is because his blood vessels are widening, which is referred to as dilation. When dilation occurs, the walls of the blood vessels relax, which in turn causes the blood vessels to become wider. As the blood vessels get wider, it means that there is more space for the blood to flow through, effectively increasing the amount of blood flowing through them. This change in blood flow can be a response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system, as mentioned in the background information. These signals may be triggered by a variety of factors, including changes in body temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, exercise, stress, or certain hormones and chemicals in the body. While the dilation of Bob's blood vessels does indicate an increase in blood flow, further tests and information would be needed to determine the cause and whether there are any underlying issues that are causing this response."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire   to find a way out of trouble. Question: What did the company where Dick Drew work learn from its mistake? Options: A: They encouraged people to work a longer time. B: They discouraged   people to think freely. C: They asked people to spend all their work time developing new ideas. D: They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas.

I have forgotten the name of an old lady, who was a customer on the paper route in my home town when I was a twelve-year-old boy. Yet it stays in my memory, for she taught me a lesson of forgiveness that I shall never forget. On a winter afternoon, a friend and I were throwing stones onto the leaning roof of the old lady's house from a spot near her backyard. The object of our play was to observe how the stones changed to missiles as they rolled to the roof's edge and shot out into the yard. I found myself a perfectly smooth rock and threw it out. The stone, however, slipped from my hand and headed straight for a small window on the old lady's back porch. At the sound of fractured glass, we knew we were in trouble. We ran as fast as possible. I was too scared about getting caught to be concerned about the old lady with the broken window in winter. However, a few days later, when I was sure that I hadn't been discovered, I started to feel guilty for her misfortune. She still greeted me with a smile each day when I gave her the paper, but I was no longer able to act comfortably in her presence.  I made up my mind that I would save my paper delivery money, and after three weeks I had the seven dollars that I thought would cover the cost of her window. I put the money in an envelope with a note explaining that I was sorry for breaking her window and hoped that the seven dollars would cover the cost. I put the letter through the letter slot in her door. My soul felt  _ and I could have the freedom of, once again, looking straight into the old lady's kind eyes. The next day, I handed the old lady her paper and was able to return the warm smile that I was receiving from her. She gave me a bag of cookies. I thanked her and felt an envelope in it.

Books Of The Times By Anatole Broyard Soon To Be Immortal. By Ellen Alexander Conley. 216 pps. St. Martin's Press. 13.95. AT the beginning of Ellen Conley's ''Soon To Be Immortal,'' Sasha Flynn has gone back to her old job in a hospital laboratory in the hope that science will bring order back into her life, that it will help to structure what seems to her a chaos of enthusiasms and discontents. She feels that she needs a bulwark, or a discipline of some sort to defend her against her own New York City's teeming life. If she had her way - if her husband, Hatch, had not objected - she would have lived on Roosevelt Island, ''soothed on that little atoll.'' With Hatch and her two children, she is torn, like most emancipated wives and mothers, between her despotic love for them and her fidelity to the idea of civil liberty. Her husband is an artist, a painter, and she has nothing but personality and motherhood for credentials. Determined to produce something that comes out of her soul rather than her memory, she is reading a book sent to her by her mother: ''Write Your Novel in 90 Days.'' As if nature were rebuking her for being insufficiently appreciative, Sasha becomes pregnant again at the age of 40. Hatch wants her to have an abortion, but she has seen bad fetuses in their plastic sacks in the hospital. She imagines them bursting their sacks and crying all at once, crying for ''the tears in things.'' On one page of the ''Time-Life Book of Conception'' the live fetuses look like ''a cross between a jellyfish and a skydiver.'' On the next page, they seem ''less amphibian and more human, with an ironic wistfulness.'' Hatch contends that they don't have money, space, time or energy enough for a third child. The second one has just emerged from diapers, and Hatch feels that he has exhausted diapers as canvases. ''You're too old,'' he said to Sasha. ''The child may be defective.'' ''What if it were?'' she answers. ''Couldn't you think of that autistic child as a pet?'' ''If we ever had a kid that way,'' he says, ''I'd give him to you as a parting gift, a piece of sculpture from me.'' At that, Sasha punches him in the nose - the last resort of tolerance and understanding -and he goes out to get drunk, only to discover that he hasn't enough money even for that. Mrs. Conley knows her way around pregnancies and hospitals. There is a strong scene in the cancer ward when an elderly terminal case nostalgically asks Sasha if he can feel the baby kick, and soon she is surrounded by dying grandfathers eager to feel the beginning of life. Her stomach is so heavy that the obstetrician advises her to sleep in a slanted bed. When she points out that her bed is a mattress on the floor, he advises her to unhinge a closet door and prop it up on telephone books. She wishes she could be gay and heedless about this baby, like the two paraplegics, lovers apparently, who careen through the hospital corridors at top speed in their wheelchairs. She would like to be cool and collected, like the woman in the next bed when she had her last child, who was calmly doing a crossword puzzle and asked Sasha if she knew a five-letter word for ''a bitter vetch.'' Better still, she would like to have her child delivered by three young policemen with golden hair as they speed in a squad car through the city with the sirens notifying the world of her offspring's arrival. In the hospital room with Sasha are three tiny young women from Taiwan who have come to New York City on visitors' passes to have their babies, so that they will be born as American citizens, enabling their parents to move up the immigration list. Listening to them, Sasha realizes that life, even babies, is a series of strategies. As in her first novel, ''Soho Madonna,'' Mrs. Conley explores the conventions of the unconventional family, the often irrational improvisations that, like two willing but unsynchronized dancers, she and her husband muddle through. Sasha is a nurse-mother in the sense that she will do anything on earth that seems right to her. She is a modern heroine, a woman who approaches life as if it were a novel that could be written in 90 days - and then revised where necessary. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is a review of a book called \\"Soon To Be Immortal\\" by Ellen Alexander Conley.

In the second reaction, reaction B, he uses a weaker model of burner, so the temperature of the reaction is low.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which reaction will proceed slower? A:","output":"Reaction B will proceed slower because it uses a weaker model of burner which results in a lower temperature. In general, a higher temperature increases the rate of a chemical reaction by providing the reactants with more kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions between the molecules involved. Conversely, a lower temperature causes particles to move more slowly, reducing the frequency and force of collisions, and ultimately slowing down the rate of the reaction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","output":"Title: Perfecting Your Pool Game: Setting Up the Billiard Rack for a Randomized Break Introduction Pool enthusiasts know that the success of a game often begins with the initial break. Over the years, players have debated and experimented with strategies for preparing the perfect break. One commonly debated topic is the arrangement of balls within the billiard rack. In this article, we will explore a method that promotes randomness by starting with the 1-ball at the front of the rack and arranging the other balls at random. We'll also discuss how lining up the apex of the rack with the middle diamond on the side of the pool table can set you on the path to billiards success. The Randomized Rack: Starting with the 1-Ball In many traditional pool games, such as 8-ball and 9-ball, the positioning of the 1-ball is crucial. Placing the 1-ball at the front of the rack guarantees that it will be the first ball to receive the impact from the cue ball, providing a player with the opportunity to start scoring points right off the bat. Moreover, including all other balls arranged randomly behind the 1-ball promotes an element of unpredictability, which can level the playing field among players with varying skill levels. A randomized setup reduces the likelihood of running intentional patterns or sequences by the players, making the game more dynamic and skill-based. Aligning the Apex with the Middle Diamond One essential aspect of achieving a successful break is targeting the proper contact point for the cue ball. A widely accepted guideline suggests lining up the apex of the billiard triangle, where the 1-ball is positioned, with the middle diamond on the side rail of the pool table. The middle diamond on the rail is typically found halfway between the corner pocket and the side pocket. Lining up the apex with the middle diamond serves as a perfect starting point for your break shot. Successfully executed, this alignment will allow the cue ball to transfer optimum energy and momentum to the 1-ball, creating a powerful and effective opening spread. Perfecting Your Break While a randomized rack and proper alignment can have a significant impact on your break shot, there are other factors to consider as well. Some tips for achieving a successful break include: 1. Squarely striking the cue ball: Ensure that your cue strikes the cue ball's center to minimize any unnecessary spin that could result in a miscue or a poor initial shot. 2. Power and accuracy: Find a balance between the power of your break and the accuracy needed to retain control of the cue ball and avoid fouls. 3. Stance and grip: Maintain a stable stance and firm grip on your cue, allowing you to direct the cue in a smooth, straight line during your stroke. 4. Follow through: The more natural and fluid your follow-through, the better the energy transfer from the cue to the cue ball. Practice a smooth and rhythmic follow-through to maximize your break shot's effectiveness. In Conclusion A randomized billiard rack, starting with the 1-ball at the apex and aligning with the middle diamond on the side rail, can enhance your pool game by balancing unpredictability and skill. By incorporating this setup technique alongside other break shot best practices, you can improve your game's overall enjoyment and bring your pool-playing abilities to new heights.

Title: The Outsiders Movie plot: The story begins with Ponyboy Curtis (Howell) writing a school report about his recent experiences growing up in 1965 Tulsa, Oklahoma. His friends, the Greasers, are a gang of tough, low-income middle-class teens. The gang includes 14-year-old Ponyboy and his two older brothers, Sodapop (Lowe) and Darrell \\"Darry\\" (Swayze), as well as Johnny (Macchio), Dallas \\"Dally\\" Winston (Dillon), Two-Bit Matthews (Estevez), and Steve Randle (Cruise). Their long-term rivalry is with the Socs, a gang of wealthier kids from the other side of town. Two Socs, Bob Sheldon (Garrett) and Randy Anderson (Dalton), confront Johnny, Ponyboy, and Two-Bit, who are strolling with and talking to the Socs' girlfriends, Cherry (Lane) and Marcia (Meyrink), after watching a movie at a drive-in theater. The girls defuse the situation by going back with the Socs. Ponyboy and Johnny fall asleep in the parking lot where Ponyboy dreams of his deceased parents. Awakened by Johnny, he worriedly heads home fearing Darrel's frustration. As he fears, Darrel is angry with him for coming home late. Sodapop draws himself into the argument, resulting in Darrel hitting Ponyboy. Emotionally hurt by Darrel's assault, Ponyboy flees his home and finds Johnny. The two boys head to the park. Ponyboy and Johnny are soon attacked in the park by Bob, Randy, and three other Socs. They kick Johnny to the ground and grab Ponyboy and attempt to drown him by dunking him in the park fountain, making him temporarily unconscious. When they attempt to drown Ponyboy, Johnny pulls out his switchblade and stabs Bob to death, while the other Socs quickly flee to the police. After regaining consciousness and learning what has happened, Ponyboy goes with Johnny in search of Dally's help. On Dally's advice, and the fact that murderers in Oklahoma will be executed on the electric chair, Ponyboy and Johnny flee on a cargo train, and hide out in an abandoned church on Jay Mountain in Windrixville.

Information:  - The Wright Stuff is a British television chat show, hosted by Matthew Wright, and airing on Channel 5 each weekday morning from 9:15 to 11:15am. The series characterises itself as \\"Britain's brightest daytime show\\", which \\"gives ordinary people the chance to talk and comment on everything such as news to the social, emotional and even sexual issues back at home\\", as well as featuring \\"showbiz stars and media commentators\\". \\"The Wright Stuff\\" has been nominated as \\"Best Daytime Programme\\" at both the Royal Television Society and the National Television Awards.  - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - Edgbaston is a suburban area of Central Birmingham, England. It is curved around the southwest of the city centre. It is bordered by Moseley to the south east and by Smethwick and Winson Green to the north west.  - TV-am was a TV company that broadcast the ITV franchise for breakfast television in the United Kingdom from 1 February 1983 until 31 December 1992. The station was the UK's first national operator of a commercial breakfast television franchise. Its daily broadcasts were between 6 am and 9:25 am.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white. However, scientifically speaking, monochromatic light refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (see spectral color).  - BBC London is the BBC English Region producing local radio, television, teletext and online services in London and parts of the surrounding area. Its output includes the daily \\"BBC London News\\" and weekly \\"Sunday Politics\\" on television, the BBC Radio London radio station and local coverage of the London area on BBC Online and BBC Red Button. The region's headquarters are situated in the new eastern extension of Broadcasting House.  - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.  - BBC Radio Berkshire is the BBC Local Radio service for the English county of Berkshire, North Hampshire, and South Oxfordshire. Radio Berkshire broadcasts on 94.6 (Henley-on-Thames), 95.4 (Windsor), 104.1 (Hannington) and 104.4 (Reading) FM from its studios at Caversham Park near Reading. The station is also available on DAB, Freeview, and through live streaming on the internet, also on demand for thirty days after broadcast through the BBC iPlayer.  - Midlands Today is the BBC's regional television news service for the West Midlands.

Both the presenters had previously presented TV - am , the breakfast franchise which ran before the start of the regional ITV programming .  - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - Pebble Mill Studios was a television studio complex owned by the BBC located in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England. The nine acre site was opened by Princess Anne on 10 November 1971, and in addition to the studios contained two canteens, a post office, gardens, a seven storey office block, and an Outside Broadcasting (OB) base.  - Anne Margaret Diamond (born 8 September 1954) is an English radio and television presenter and journalist. She hosted \\"Good Morning Britain\\" for TV-am and the similarly titled \\"Good Morning... with Anne and Nick\\" for BBC One, both with Nick Owen as her co-presenter. Currently she presents a phone-in show on BBC Radio Berkshire on weekday mornings from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm and makes regular appearances airing her views as a panellist and stand-in presenter on \\"The Wright Stuff\\" on Channel 5 and BBC London, and is a regular columnist for the \\"Daily Mail\\".  - Breakfast Television (BT) is the branding used for morning shows broadcast by stations of Rogers Media's television network City.

Q:Information:  - Interstate 10 (I-10) is the southernmost cross-country interstate highway in the American Interstate Highway System. It stretches from the Pacific Ocean at State Route 1 (SR 1) (Pacific Coast Highway) in Santa Monica, California, to I-95 in Jacksonville, Florida. This freeway is part of the originally planned Interstate Highway network that was laid out in 1956, and its last section was completed in 1990. I-10 is the fourth-longest Interstate Highway in the United States, following I-90, I-80, and I-40. About one-third of its length is within the state of Texas, where the freeway spans the state at its widest breadth.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (commonly known as the Interstate Highway System, Interstate Freeway System, Interstate System, or simply the Interstate) is a network of controlled-access highways that forms a part of the National Highway System of the United States. The system is named for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who championed its formation. Construction was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, and the original portion was completed 35 years later, although some urban routes were cancelled and never built. The network has since been extended and, , it had a total length of . , about one-quarter of all vehicle miles driven in the country use the Interstate system. In 2006, the cost of construction was estimated at about 425 billion (equivalent to  in ).  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area.

Its studios are located on Interstate 10 in Northwest San Antonio near Balcones Heights , TX , and the transmitter site is in unincorporated Bexar County near Government Canyon .  - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\".  - Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals. RF usually refers to electrical rather than mechanical oscillations. However, mechanical RF systems do exist (see mechanical filter and RF MEMS).  - Jacksonville is a seaport city and the seat of Duval County, Florida, United States.

For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Build a satellite - Attach a rocket - Add rocket fuel - Launch rocket - Satellite goes into orbit.  Question: suppose less steam rises happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER satelites in space.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The question seems to be asking about how a hypothetical decrease in the amount of steam rising would affect smaller satellites in space and how that would influence the second effect mentioned. From the process provided, the second effect after launching the rocket is the satellite going into orbit. This is a relatively complex situation to unpick, so let's break the question down into smaller parts: 1. Firstly, does a decrease in steam rising impact small satellites? The answer here would be 'no effect'. The steam produced during a rocket launch doesn't have any direct effect on satellites in the space. The steam is a byproduct of rocket fuel combustion, typically occurring when hydrogen fuel combines with oxygen. Once it leaves the rocket, it disperses and doesn't have any direct influence on the satellite. In space, steam would not matter due to the vacuum environment. 2. Secondly, how does this influence the 'going into orbit' event? Since the decrease in the amount of rising steam won't affect the satellites directly, we can also infer it won't influence their ability to go into orbit. Therefore, the answer would also be 'no effect'. It's important to note that precise rocket fuel combustion, which gives rise to steam, is vital to providing the necessary thrust for a rocket to overcome Earth's gravity and launch a satellite into its designated orbit. However, once in space, factors such as gravitational forces, the satellite's velocity, and its altitude above the Earth primarily govern its ability to maintain a stable orbit, not the presence or absence of steam.    The nature and operations of satellites, once in space, are largely independent of the conditions of their launch phases. As such, reducing the steam originating from their launch would not directly alter the behaviours or functions of smaller satellites in their orbits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a clause in the first amendment: establishment, textual or free exercise?\\" is in \\"The first amendment to the US Constitution states \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\\" The two parts, known as the \\"establishment clause\\" and the \\"free exercise clause\\" respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court's interpretations of the \\"separation of church and state\\" doctrine. Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America's doctrine for church-state separation: no coercion in religious matters, no expectation to support a religion against one's will, and religious liberty encompasses all religions. In sum, citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith, any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary, and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The clause that is not in the first amendment from the options you've provided is the \\"textual\\" clause. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution only includes two main clauses relating to religion: the \\"establishment clause\\" and the \\"free exercise clause\\".  The \\"establishment clause\\" prohibits the U.S. Congress from making any law \\"respecting an establishment of religion.\\" Essentially, this mandates a separation of church and state, and is interpreted to mean the government can not favor, endorse, or provide preferential treatment to any religious establishment. The \\"free exercise clause\\" prevents the government from prohibiting individual religious practices, contributing to the idea of religious liberty. It means that citizens are allowed to follow and practice the religion of their choosing.  The \\"textual clause\\" does not exist and appears to be a made-up term for this context. It doesn't align with the known clauses related to the First Amendment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The prime minister, who is in Delhi to pave the way for the UK's first post-Brexit trade deal, said the UK was already able to attract \\"the brightest and the best\\" from outside the EU. \\"Nine out of 10 visa applications from India are already accepted,\\" she said. But she said the UK could give ground if Indians who overstayed their visas could be returned more swiftly. \\"The UK will consider further improvements to our visa offer if, at the same time, we can step up the speed and volume of returns of Indians with no right to remain,\\" she told reporters. Her government also intends to make it easier for wealthy Indian business executives to come to the UK. A small group of high-net-worth individuals and their families will be offered access to the Great Club - a bespoke visa and immigration service - to make visa applications smoother. Thousands of Indians on work visas will also be able to join the Registered Travellers Scheme which will mean they can get through UK border controls more quickly. \\"As we leave the EU, we want to ensure that the UK remains one of the most attractive countries in the world to do business and invest,\\" Mrs May said. The prime minister flew into Delhi late last night to be greeted by the worst smog this city has seen in nearly 20 years. Where better to get a taste of life beyond the EU - than India. With such deep historical links between the two countries - surely the UK can cut through the bureaucratic smog that saw Brussels spend nearly a decade negotiating, but ultimately fail to agree a deal with the world's fastest growing economy. But Indian business leaders are confused. No-one knows what the UK's relationship with Europe will eventually look like, and many are unsure about how much can be usefully discussed until the UK has withdrawn from the EU - a point that is at least two years away. Some things are clear and all too familiar. Trade and immigration are linked. If the UK wants better access to Indian markets, the government in Delhi wants a looser approach to UK work and student visas. This week saw Britain's visa rules for foreign visitors tightened. Specific deals will be announced over the next 24 hours but more clarity around a trade relationship that has stagnated or even declined in recent years is likely to remain enveloped in the Delhi smog. Visa issues risk dominating Theresa May's first trade trip since becoming prime minister. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a technology summit in Delhi he wanted to encourage \\"greater mobility\\" for its young people in education. He said: \\"Education is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future. \\"We must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities.\\" Cobra Beer founder Lord Bilimoria earlier said restrictions on staying in the UK after their studies meant the number of Indians attending UK universities had halved in the past five years. He said \\"movement of people\\" would form a key part of any trade negotiations. The number of study visas issued to Indian nationals fell from 68,238 in the year to June 2010 to 11,864 five years later, official UK figures show. The solution, according to Karan Bilimoria, is to exclude foreign students from Britain's statistics on net migration, which Mrs May has pledged to cut to below 100,000 annually - down from 336,000 in the year to June 2015. \\"We need to immediately get the government, Theresa May, on this visit to announce and say 'we're no longer going to include international students within the net migration figures,'\\" crossbencher Lord Bilimoria told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. He added: \\"The reality is Theresa May when she was home secretary did deliver very, very negative messages towards immigration.\\" \\"She has got a lot of bridge-building to do when she goes to India.\\" Mrs May will be accompanied on the three-day trip by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and trade minister Greg Hands as well as representatives from 33 UK companies.

Question: Why was Saoirse Ronan replaced by Alicia Vikander? Passage 1:In 2009 it was announced that the feature film Testament of Youth was in development by BBC Films and Heyday Films producer David Heyman, and was to be directed by James Kent. This had the support of the Vera Brittain Estate, Brittain's daughter Shirley Williams, and Brittain's biographer Mark Bostridge who is acting as consultant. Saoirse Ronan was cast to play Brittain in 2012 but was replaced in December 2013 when it was announced that Alicia Vikander would play Vera Brittain in the film which was released in late 2014 as part of the First World War commemorations. On 4 February 2014 Kit Harington joined the cast to play the role of Brittain's fiancé Roland Leighton. On 13 February 2014, Colin Morgan, Taron Egerton, and Alexandra Roach were announced to have joined the film's cast. An ensemble cast was later confirmed as filming began, including Dominic West, Emily Watson, Joanna Scanlan, Hayley Atwell, Jonathan Bailey and Anna Chancellor. It substituted Merton College, Oxford in the scenes showing Brittain's time as a student at Somerville College, arguing that filming in Somerville itself would been too difficult in light of the new buildings constructed there since the film's time period.  Passage 2:In 2004, Mendler got her first acting role in the animated Indian film The Legend of Buddha, in which she portrayed Lucy. When she was 13 years old, she got an acting role as a guest star on the soap opera General Hospital. She portrayed the dream child of character Lulu Spencer, in which the two have an argument on Mendler's character's birthday. The scene, lasting just under a minute, is later revealed to be a dream. That same year, Mendler was the voice of the character Thorn in the video game Bone: The Great Cow Race, which was based on the Bone comic series. In 2007, Mendler made her film debut in the film adaption of the Alice series, titled Alice Upside Down. Mendler starred alongside Disney Channel actress Alyson Stoner and Lucas Grabeel. Mendler portrayed the antagonistic role of Pamela, who is the rival of Stoner's character, Alice. For the film's soundtrack, Mendler provided backing vocals on the song \\"Free Spirit\\", performed by Stoner. Also in 2007 Mendler auditioned for Sonny with a Chance for the role of Sonny Munroe, but Demi Lovato was chosen. In 2008, it was announced that Mendler would play the role of Kristen Gregory in the film adaption of the popular teen novel series The Clique by Lisi Harrison. Mendler had the role of Kristen, a girl who attends OCD on a scholarship, and works hard to keep her good grades.  Passage 3:He was born John Miller in County Clare, Ireland. His father was John Miller and his mother, John's wife, Anne née Browne. He was educated at Dalston School and Eton College before joining the British Army in 1760 as a cornet. He was on active service in the Battle of Emsdorf and at Belleisle, France in 1761, before retiring from the army in 1763. He was admitted to study at the Middle Temple in 1765, though does not seem to have made any progress with his legal studies. He also studied at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, though he did not graduate. In August 1765 he married Anna née Riggs (1741–1781), adding her name to his own. They had a son and a daughter. In July 1762 he inherited his family estates; they were worth little, but his wife brought substantial wealth to the marriage, enabling him to build a prestigious house at Batheaston, Somerset. The couple there held a fortnightly literary salon along with competitions and prizes. The prizes were drawn from an ornately decorated Roman vase and the affair was mocked as Lady Miller's Vase, though that did not dissuade distinguished contributions from the like of David Garrick and Christopher Anstey. In 1778 he was created a Baronet, of Ballicasey in the County of Clare. Anna died on 24 June 1781; on 9 September 1795 he married Jane née Sell, widow of Sir Thomas Davenport. He was elected Member of Parliament for Newport, Cornwall in 1784.","output":"1"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In a grueling 36-hole U.S. Open sectional qualifier, against a field fortified by PGA Tour winners, on an old-school golf course that hosted the 1952 U.S. Open, a 15-year-old stole the show.      Houston’s Cole Hammer birdied four of his final five holes to cap the afternoon round of 2-under 68 at Northwood Club in Dallas. He finished one stroke behind medalist Mark Silvers, a Web.com Tour player from Thunderbolt, Ga.      Hammer will be the fourth-youngest golfer ever to compete in the U.S. Open when the tournament takes place June 18-21 at Chambers Bay in University Place, Wash.      Dallas’ Cody Gribble posted matching rounds of 67 to tie for third, earning his second straight U.S. Open spot. The Highland Park graduate, who played with Jordan Spieth on Texas’ national championship team of 2012, finished tied for 21st in last year’s Open at Pinehurst (N.C.) Resort.      Kyle Jones, who just closed his career at Baylor, also tied for third along with Jason Allred of Scottsdale, Ariz., and amateur Matt Mabrey of Little Rock, Ark.      When Hammer hit his approach on 18 to 4 feet, he drew loud applause from club members and fans on the patio above the picturesque hole where Julius Boros accepted his Open trophy 63 years ago.      “This means the world to me,” Hammer said. “I’ve dreamed about it my whole life. It’s going to be awesome.”      With a growth spurt over the last 10 months, Hammer has added 4 inches and 15 pounds — to 5-9, 125.      The distance increase helped him stay with playing partners Martin Flores, a PGA Tour player from Fort Worth, and Jon Trasamar of Blue Earth, Minn. (Flores fell three short of the qualifying number).      “This gives me a lot of confidence,” Hammer said. “I was coming in thinking I was a bit of a long shot, but why not? Just give it my best shot.”      Having won four of his last five junior events, Hammer had momentum on his side. He made few mistakes in the morning, shooting a six-birdie, no-bogey 64.      After going 24 holes without a bogey, he made his first on No. 7 and then bogeyed 12. Needing to make up ground, Hammer birdied four of the final five holes.      “I was confident,” he said. “I’ve been hitting it well and putting well, so I thought if I continue doing that here I’ll have a chance.”      Hammer has already committed to UT. So he headed straight to Gribble to offer congratulations. Gribble was well aware of Hammer’s game      “It’s great that he got in,” Gribble said. “He’s a great kid. I love his game, love his demeanor.”      Gribble, a Web.com Tour member, was concluding a busy stretch. He played in the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial and the AT&T Byron Nelson on special exemptions and then the Greater Dallas Open, which concluded Sunday.      But he was no worse for wear at Northwood. Although he said it was not a great ball-striking day, he managed his game and the course well.      “It really wasn’t anything special,” he said. “I made some good saves, which really helps, but it was just a solid day. I minimized mistakes.”      Last year Gribble made it through qualifying in Memphis, Tenn. At Pinehurst, he shot 69 on Sunday to improve 14 places. It remains his biggest payday (98,598).      “Looking back on it, I’d say the U.S. Open was the kickoff of my pro career,” Gribble said. “Not many people can say they qualified for the U.S. Open twice in a row.”      SMU’s DeChambeau, veteran Elder qualify to compete in U.S. Open      A week after winning the NCAA Championship, SMU junior Bryson DeChambeau qualified for the U.S. Open on Monday. He tied for third in sectional qualifying at Columbus, Ohio, finishing at 11-under 133 over 36 holes.      Fifteen players in Columbus qualified for the June 18-21 Open at Chambers Bay in University Place, Wash. DeChambeau will play his first PGA Tour event at this week’s FedEx St. Jude Classic in Memphis.      Dallas’ Brad Elder also qualified.

The test states that a patio is smoother than a sandlot, meaning that the patio has a more even and level surface. Therefore, when a bird runs across these surfaces, it experiences different amounts of friction.  Friction is the force that opposes an object's motion against another surface, such as the contact between a bird's feet and the ground. Rougher surfaces tend to create more friction, while smoother surfaces create less friction. This is because the irregularities on the rough surfaces generate more contact points and resistance against the moving object (in this case, a bird). Since the sand lot is described as less smooth than the patio, it is, therefore, rougher by comparison and has more irregularities on its surface. This means that when a bird runs across a sand lot, it experiences more friction than it would on a patio. To summarize, the logic test leads to the conclusion that if a bird runs across and experiences more friction, it must be on surface (B) sand lot.

The research is from poor to middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  Robert Black from the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in prefix = st1 /Marylandwas the leading writer of the research. He says more than 3.5 million mothers and children under five die in poor countries each year because of hunger.  He says more than two million children die from underdevelopment, either before or after birth. Millions of others who survive face a lifetime of disabilities or early death. And the effects are not just physical. Poor brain development can limit economic success as children become adults. Then the cycle of poverty and hunger often repeats for their children.  Doctor Black says hungry children are also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease as adults. He says the studies show that food programs need to place the greatest importance on the first two years of life. Hungry children can suffer the whole life damage from age two.  So it is high time to improve their diets. Diets should include foods rich in vitamin A and other useful things. The researchers say early help like these could reduce child deaths by 25%.  The research has faced some criticism . A medical aid group says the researchers underestimate the number of child deaths from hunger. The researchers say there are findings that support this treatment but more studies are needed to compare it to hospital care. What can we learn from this passage?

Problem:Di solito capiamo la normale funzione di qualcosa a seconda di quel che succede se la togliamo, dall'opposto di ciò che vediamo quando la togliamo. Solution:","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the sentence in Italian.  The Italian sentence states, \\"Di solito capiamo la normale funzione di qualcosa a seconda di quel che succede se la togliamo, dall'opposto di ciò che vediamo quando la togliamo.\\" It means, \\"Usually, we understand the normal function of something depending on what happens if we remove it, from the opposite of what we see when we remove it.\\" Step 2: Break down the sentence into smaller parts. To translate this sentence accurately, I will break it down into smaller parts as follows: - Di solito (usually) - capiamo la normale funzione di qualcosa (we understand the normal function of something) - a seconda di (depending on) - quel che succede (what happens) - se la togliamo (if we remove it) - dall'opposto di (from the opposite of) - ciò che vediamo (what we see) - quando la togliamo (when we remove it) Step 3: Translate each part into Arabic. Now I will translate each part of the sentence into Arabic: - Di solito (عادة) - capiamo la normale funzione di qualcosa (نفهم الوظيفة الطبيعية لشيء ما) - a seconda di (بناء على) - quel che succede (ما يحدث) - se la togliamo (إذا أزلناه) - dall'opposto di (من العكس) - ciò che vediamo (ما نراه) - quando la togliamo (عندما نزيله) Step 4: Combine the translated parts to form the Arabic sentence.

Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation.

Is the premise \\"Two men play instruments together.\\" true if \\"The men are running a marathon.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"Two men play instruments together\\" cannot be directly deemed as true or false based only on the information that \\"The men are running a marathon.\\" The reason for this is that these two statements describe different activities, and there is not enough information to determine if they are mutually exclusive or if they can be performed simultaneously. On the surface, these two activities seem incompatible. Playing musical instruments typically involves dedicating attention to the instruments and the music being played, and this could lead to difficulties performing strenuous physical activity like running a marathon. Additionally, running a marathon requires focus and stamina, and it is unlikely that someone could effectively perform an instrument while maintaining a consistent running pace. However, it is not impossible for the two men to engage in both activities within a specific time frame or under certain conditions. For example, they could be running a marathon while stopping at specific points along the route to play their instruments, making both statements true within a broader context. Alternatively, the men could be playing instruments that are designed or modified to be played during strenuous physical activity, such as harmonicas, allowing them to perform music while running. Ultimately, whether the premise \\"Two men play instruments together\\" is true in the context of \\"The men are running a marathon\\" depends on several factors that are not explicitly mentioned in either statement. These factors include the specific instruments being played, the context and the timing of the activities, and any potential modifications that have been made to facilitate the combination of these activities. In conclusion, we cannot definitively determine if the premise \\"Two men play instruments together\\" is true based solely on the information that \\"The men are running a marathon.\\" Further details about the nature of the instruments, any adaptations to the activities involved, and the specific context in which the actions occur would be necessary to ascertain the validity of the premise."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Beatrix bequeaths prosperous nation, popular monarchy, says Richard Fitzwilliams. Beatrix's mother worked hard in 1953 when Netherlands was hit by huge storm. Fitzwilliams: Dutch have investiture, not coronation; protocol is relaxed. Monarchy unites country with fractious history, the author adds. Article:","output":"Title: Beatrix's Legacy: A Prosperous Nation and a Popular Monarchy Introduction The Dutch monarchy has always held a special place in the heart of the Netherlands and its people. Under the reign of Queen Beatrix, the country experienced not only prosperity but also a strengthened connection between the monarchy and its citizens. In a recent interview, Richard Fitzwilliams, a renowned royal commentator, remarked on the positive impact of Beatrix's rule, her mother's hard work in 1953, and the unique nature of the Dutch investiture ceremony. A Prosperous Nation under Beatrix's Rule When Beatrix ascended to the throne in 1980, she gave her all to ensure that the country would thrive economically and politically. Her efforts proved successful and, during her 33-year reign, the Netherlands grew into a more prosperous and advanced nation. Richard Fitzwilliams notes her contributions to the nation's progress and highlights the popular support the monarchy enjoyed amongst the Dutch populace. In addition to her numerous initiatives that aided her nation's growth, Beatrix gracefully upheld the delicate balance between her role as a reigning monarch and one who is in touch with her people. The resulting popularity of the monarchy under her reign was undeniable, as evidenced by the outpouring of love and affection by the Dutch people during her tenure. Building on the Legacies of the Past The strong foundations of today's prosperous Dutch nation were built not only by Beatrix herself but also by her predecessors. Her mother, Queen Juliana, played a pivotal role in rebuilding the Netherlands following the devastating storm of 1953. Fitzwilliams underlines the importance of the hard work and dedication of Juliana in overcoming this crisis and shaping a hopeful, united nation. The Unique Dutch Investiture Ceremony Contrary to many European monarchies, the Dutch observe an investiture ceremony rather than a coronation when a new monarch ascends to the throne. According to Fitzwilliams, this reflects a decidedly more relaxed protocol in contrast to the pomp and circumstance of traditional coronations. This particular tradition has endeared the Dutch monarchy to the nation and contributed to the deep-rooted connection between the people and their royal family. A Monarchy that Binds the Nation Fitzwilliams emphasizes the role of the Dutch monarchy in uniting a country with a fractious history. The strong bond between the monarchy and the people has helped in maintaining unity, social cohesion, and stability, which are quintessential for the nation's progress and prosperity. The values embodied by Beatrix and the entire Dutch royal family serve as a source of strength and inspiration for the people of the Netherlands. Conclusion As Beatrix's legacy of a prosperous nation and a popular monarchy endures, it is evident that her reign has left an indelible mark on the history of the Netherlands. The dedication and resilience exemplified by Beatrix, her mother Juliana, and the rest of the royal family have played a critical role in shaping the nation's success. By preserving the traditions and values that have solidified its position in the hearts of the Dutch people, the monarchy continues to bring unity, stability, and prosperity to a nation that cherishes and values its royal family deeply."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Choose the best option from the 5 given options and report that option. Question: If the charge of staying in a student youth hostel 18.00/day for the first week, and 15.00/day for each additional week, How much does it cost to stay for 23 days?  Option A: 336  Option B: 289  Option C: 282  Option D: 274  Option E: 286 Output:","output":"To solve this problem, I first used the definition to identify that this is a case of simple arithmetic where the goal is to calculate the total cost of staying in the hostel for 23 days. I broke down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first week (7 days) and the cost for the remaining days (23 - 7 = 16 days). For the first week, the cost is 18.00/day, so I multiplied 18 by 7 to get the cost for the first 7 days: 18.00 * 7 = 126. Now, I need to calculate the cost for the remaining 16 days. Since each additional week costs 15.00/day, I first determined how many full weeks and extra days are in the remaining 16 days. There are 2 full weeks (14 days) and an extra 2 days. The cost for the 2 full weeks is: 15.00/day * 14 days = 210. For the remaining 2 days, I assumed that these two days still cost 15.00/day since it hasn't been explicitly defined otherwise. Therefore, the cost for these extra days is: 15.00/day * 2 days = 30. Finally, I added the costs of the first week, the 2 full additional weeks, and the remaining 2 days: 126 + 210 + 30 = 366. However, since the given options did not have the correct answer that I calculated (366), I analyzed the problem again and realized that perhaps there is a \\"weekly\\" discount implied for the remaining 2 days. In this case, one additional week (7 days) would cost 15.00 * 7 = 105. Thus, the cost per day for those remaining 2 days should be discounted by the same ratio as the weekly discount: 18 - ((18 * 7) - 105) / 7 = 18 - 3 = 15. By considering the discounted daily rate for the remaining 2 days, the new total cost would be: 126 (first week) + 210 (2 full additional weeks) + 30 (2 days at discounted daily rate) = 366. This time, after thorough re-evaluation of the problem, I concluded that none of the provided options matched the correct answer that I calculated based on the given definition and information. Therefore, unfortunately, I cannot choose any of the given options as the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A teenager is riding a skateboard along side a metal fence.\\" if \\"A teenager runs on foot near a brick wall\\"?","output":"It is not possible to conclude that \\"A teenager is riding a skateboard alongside a metal fence\\" based on the information \\"A teenager runs on foot near a brick wall.\\" The two situations are distinctly different in  various aspects, including the activity performed by the teenager, the mode of transportation, and the surrounding environment. 1. Activity performed by the teenager: In the first situation, the teenager is riding a skateboard, which is an entirely different activity from running. Skateboarding involves using a skateboard, which is a flat, narrow board with four wheels attached underneath. It requires a different set of physical skills and coordination than running. In the second situation, the teenager is running, which is an individual, high-impact exercise that is performed on foot and requires no equipment other than appropriate footwear. Running is a fundamental form of human locomotion that primarily involves the lower body muscles and cardiovascular endurance. 2. Mode of transportation: In the first scenario, the teenager is using a skateboard as their mode of transportation, which means the teenager is riding on the wheels of the skateboard to move. Skateboarding is a popular recreational and sporting activity that is sometimes also used as a means of transportation. In the second scenario, the teenager is on foot, which means they're using their own body's muscular strength, endurance, and energy to move. Running is a natural form of human movement that has been practiced throughout human history for various purposes, such as hunting, escaping danger, or as a form of exercise. 3. Surrounding environment: The environment in each situation is also different. The first scenario involves a metal fence, which is typically made of steel, aluminum, or wrought iron and often used as a boundary or a barrier for protecting properties or other spaces. Fences can vary in height, design, and purpose. The setting could indicate that the teenager is skateboarding in a park, a residential area, or near an industrial site. In the second scenario, the teenager is running near a brick wall, which is made from bricks, a common building material. Brick walls are typically found in residential, commercial, or public spaces and provide structural support and privacy, among other functions. The surrounding environment could be a narrow urban alley, a suburban neighborhood, or even a historical site with old brick architecture. Therefore, based on the provided information, one cannot conclude that the statement \\"A teenager is riding a skateboard alongside a metal fence\\" is true if the context is \\"A teenager runs on foot near a brick wall.\\" The two scenarios are essentially different and have no direct correlation or implications that could lead to this conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Use the suction cup near the home button to gently lift the screen. Be careful not to pull it straight upward, as there are cables connected internally. Step 4: Once partially lifted, use the plastic opening tool to pry the screen open along the sides, separating it from the case. Step 5: With the screen partially lifted, locate the metallic plate protecting three connectors responsible for the display. Unscrew the three Phillips head (PH #000) screws and remove the plate. Step 6: Use the spudger to gently disconnect the three connectors by prying them up. Now, the screen should be detached. Step 7: Take the new iPhone 5 screen and reconnect the three connectors, ensuring they snap into place. Step 8: Reinstall the metallic plate over the connectors and secure it with the three Phillips head screws. Step 9: Align and gently press down on the edges of the screen to snap it back into place. Step 10: Secure the screen by reinstalling the two Pentalobe screws at the bottom of the iPhone. Step 11: Turn your iPhone back on to confirm if it's working correctly. 2. Where can I go to replace my iPhone 4's screen? If you are not confident that you can replace the screen on your own or prefer to have a professional handle the repair, you have several options: A. Authorized Apple Service Providers or Apple Retail Stores: Visit an authorized Apple service provider or an Apple retail store to have your iPhone 4's screen replaced. Make sure to book an appointment before visiting. It is essential to note that this might be an expensive option, especially if your iPhone 4 is no longer covered by an Apple warranty. B. Third-party cell phone repair shops: You may find many local mobile repair shops that can replace the iPhone 4 screen for a lower cost. However, ensure the shop you choose is reputable and uses quality replacement parts. You can find reviews or recommendations online or from friends and family. Keep in mind that using unauthorized service providers might void any remaining Apple warranty or cause potential issues with future repairs. C. Online repair services: Some online service providers can offer mail-in repair services. They will send you a shipping label to mail your iPhone, and they will return it after repairing your screen. It is essential to research any online service providers thoroughly to ensure they are reputable and can be trusted with your device."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The original statement given is \\"A man and a woman standing on a street corner.\\" With this information alone, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about whether the man and woman are wearing matching clothes or not because there is no mention of their attire in the statement. Elaborating on the reasons why we cannot conclude whether or not they are wearing matching clothes, we can observe the following points: 1. Lack of detail about their clothes: The original statement only provides information about the presence of a man and a woman at a street corner, not about their clothes, the colors they are wearing, or any specific features of their outfits. 2. Assumptions: If we were to conclude that the man and the woman are wearing matching clothes, we would be making an assumption without any supporting evidence. It is essential to base our conclusions on the available facts and not make assumptions in the absence of information. 3. Possibilities: There are several possible scenarios regarding their clothes. They could be wearing clothes that match in color, pattern, or style. Conversely, they could also be dressed entirely differently, with no matching elements in their outfits. Without further information, it is impossible to tell which scenario is accurate. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the statement \\"A man and a woman standing on a street corner,\\" we cannot determine whether the man and woman on the street corner are wearing matching clothes or not.

Movie title: Family Plot Context: A fake psychic, Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris), and her boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern), attempt to locate the nephew of a wealthy and guilt-ridden elderly woman, Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt). Julia's deceased sister gave the baby boy up for adoption, but Julia now wants to make him her heir, and will pay Blanche 10,000 if the man, Edward Shoebridge, can be found. George Lumley discovers that Shoebridge is thought to be dead, but he tracks down another criminal, Joseph Maloney (Ed Lauter), who paid for the tombstone over an empty grave. Shoebridge murdered his adoptive parents, faked his own death and is now a successful jeweler in San Francisco known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane). He and his live-in girlfriend, Fran (Karen Black), kidnap millionaires and dignitaries, returning them in exchange for ransoms in the form of valuable gemstones. Arthur conceals an enormous diamond in plain sight in their crystal chandelier. Arthur enlists Maloney, who had helped murder his adoptive parents, to kill Blanche and George. Maloney initially refuses to help, but then contacts Blanche and George, telling them to meet him at a cafÃ© atop a mountain. He cuts the brake line of Blanche's car, but the couple manage to survive a dangerous high-speed descent. Maloney then tries to run them over, but dies in a fiery explosion when he swerves to avoid an oncoming car and tumbles down the mountain. At Maloney's funeral, his mother (Katherine Helmond) tearfully confesses to George that Shoebridge's name is now Arthur Adamson. George has to go to work, so Blanche tracks down various A.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Let's break down each question to better understand them: Question 1: How easy is it to submit a question on Quora? This question aims to gather information about the process and user experience of submitting a question on Quora. It assumes that the person asking might not be familiar with the platform or is unsure about how to ask a question. The answer to this question should provide a general overview of the process as well as any tips or guidance for successfully submitting a question on the platform. Answer: Submitting a question on Quora is relatively easy, provided you follow a few simple steps. First, create an account on Quora, or log in with your existing one. After that, you will see a \\"What is your question?\\" box at the top of the Quora homepage. Click on it and start typing the question you want to ask. As you type, Quora will suggest similar questions that have already been asked – this is to help you avoid asking duplicate questions. When you write your question, be sure to clearly and concisely phrase it to make it easy for others to understand what you're asking. Once you've composed your question, you can also add relevant topics, which will help direct it to the right audience and experts on the platform. After adding topics, simply click on \\"Submit,\\" and your question will be live for others on Quora to answer. Question 2: Why is submitting a question on Quora so difficult? This question assumes that submitting a question on Quora is inherently difficult, and the person asking the question might have faced some challenges with the process. The answer to this question should address common issues or problems people encounter when asking questions on Quora, as well as solutions or guidance on how to make the process easier. Answer: While many users find submitting a question on Quora simple and straightforward, there could be a few potential reasons why some people perceive the process as difficult. These could include: 1. Ambiguity in question phrasing: Quora encourages users to ask specific questions with clear context and phrasing. It might be challenging to submit a question if your question is vague, broad, or lacks context. In such cases, refine the question and provide appropriate context to help clarify what you're looking for. 2. Duplicate questions: As you type your question, Quora suggests similar questions that may have already been asked. If your question is very similar to one that has already been answered, you may be required to rephrase or reconsider your question to avoid redundancy. 3. Selecting the right topics: Finding and choosing the most relevant topics for your question can be time-consuming, as there might be multiple options within Quora's categorization system. Make sure to select the most appropriate topics for your question so that it reaches the right audience and experts for a satisfactory response. 4. Inappropriate or offensive content: Questions that contain inappropriate or offensive content, personal attacks, or violate Quora's policies could be flagged or removed from the platform, making the submission process difficult in such cases. Ensure that your question adheres to the platform's guidelines before submitting it. By addressing these potential issues and following Quora's guidelines, the process of submitting a question should become more manageable and efficient."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the group pick the color orange? Options:  A. Because the FBI likes it  B. not enough information  C. Because hunters wear it while hunting  D. Because the NRA likes it Answer:","output":"C.

Here are possible answers to this question: - vacuum tube - television - computer - cathode ray - oscilloscope  I believe the correct choice is \\"oscilloscope\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"Oscilloscope. An oscilloscope is an electronic test instrument used to display and analyze the waveform of electronic signals. The device measures variations in voltage and time over a period and visualizes these signals as a waveform on a display screen. Typically, the oscilloscope uses a cathode ray tube (CRT) or other screen technology to display these waveforms. The CRT in an oscilloscope functions in a similar manner to the CRT used in older televisions and computer monitors. It has an electron-emitting cathode that directs a beam of electrons toward phosphor-coated screens. The CRT allows for the visualization of voltage and time on a graph, where the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents voltage. In summary, an oscilloscope is the correct choice because it is a device used to measure and display electronic signal waveforms using a cathode ray tube. It is different from a television or computer, which primarily serve as entertainment or work devices. It is also not just the cathode ray or vacuum tube by itself, as these are components within an oscilloscope or other devices, not the entire instrument."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But I never really liked being on the water, the way my father did. I liked being in the water, moving through it, having it all around me. I was not a strong swimmer, or one who learned to swim early, for I had my fears. But I loved being in the swimming pool close to my father's office and spending those summer days with my father, who would come by on a break. I needed him to see what I could do. My father would stand there in his suit, the only person not in swimsuit.  After swimming, I would go inside his office and sit on the wooden chair in front of his big desk, where he let me play with anything I found in his top desk drawer. Sometimes, if I was left alone at his desk while he worked in the lab, an assistant or a student might come in and tell me perhaps I shouldn't be playing with his office things. But my father always showed up and said easily, \\"Oh, no, it's fine.\\" Sometimes he handed me coins and told me to get myself an ice cream...  A poet once said, \\"We look at life once, in childhood; the rest is memory.\\" And I think it is not only what we \\"look at once, in childhood\\" that decides our memories, but who, in that childhood, looks at us. Question: Which of the following is probably the best title of the passage? Options: A: Swimming, my favorite sport B: Father, source of joy and love C: Memories of past days D: Interesting summer activities A:","output":"B: Father, source of joy and love"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - peanut - major city - large city - urban areas - sports complex  I believe the correct choice is \\"sports complex\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"sports complex,\\" and there are several reasons that support this conclusion. Allow me to explain in detail why the other options do not fit the given context, and why \\"sports complex\\" is the most logical and appropriate answer. 1. Peanut: A peanut is, of course, a type of nut used as a snack and an ingredient in various dishes. It is entirely unrelated to the concept of an area or a facility related to sports or baseball stadiums. Thus, this option is unrelated to the context and can be eliminated. 2. Major city / Large city: While major cities and large cities are vast urban areas that may include numerous attractions, such as sports facilities and baseball stadiums, they don't specifically describe the area around a baseball stadium. Cities contain various types of facilities, residential areas, commercial zones, and other infrastructures, so using these terms would not accurately describe an area that is specifically meant for sports facilities. 3. Urban areas: This term is similar to major or large cities, as urban areas are regions characterized by high population density and infrastructure, including housing, transportation, and commercial spaces. Although urban areas may contain sports facilities, the term still does not specifically describe an area dedicated to sports or a baseball stadium. With the other options ruled out, we are left with \\"sports complex.\\" A sports complex is a large facility or a group of facilities that are designed and built specifically for sports activities and competitions. These complexes often contain multiple sports venues, such as baseball stadiums, football fields, basketball courts, and areas for other sports and recreational activities. They are created to provide a designated space for sports enthusiasts, athletes, and spectators to engage in or enjoy various sports. In the context of your question, the whole area being larger than just the baseball stadium suggests that there are other facilities and venues present in the area that cater to different sports and activities. Therefore, it can be concluded that the most appropriate and accurate answer is \\"sports complex,\\" as it is a term that directly relates to a large area consisting of multiple sports facilities and infrastructure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph: The story notes the price “per squat” at various spas and the cost of a do-it-yourself Internet kit. We think the story’s discussion of possible benefits is far too extensive considering the total lack of evidence to support them. We understand the need to identify some of the claims made by boosters of the therapy, but the story devotes some three paragraphs to seemingly every possible ailment the baths (or the herbs used in them) are purported to treat. It also throws in an anecdote from a woman suggesting the baths helped her to conceive at the age of 45. The caveats about chai-yok stand a good chance of getting lost in this avalanche of discussion about benefits. Aside from burns — the potential for which would seem to be obvious — we’re not sure if there are any harms associated with herbal steam baths for the vagina. The procedure seems less invasive than a douche, which is associated with potential health risks. We’ll call this not applicable. The story states that there are no studies that document the effectiveness of chai-yok for any of the conditions it is claimed to treat. It notes that while there is some biological rationale for why heat in the perineal area might be beneficial, it is impossible to say whether these steam baths do any good. The concept behind chai-yok seems vaguely reminiscent of douching, a treatment that has long been promoted as necessary for vaginal health despite a lack of supporting evidence and indications of possible harm. But while the idea may tap into some of the same psychology that makes the normal vagina seem not quite clean or healthy enough, we don’t see any evidence of overt disease-mongering in this particular story. The story quotes two doctors with expertise in gynecology and fertility. It also solicits comments from a practitioner of traditional oriental medicine. We don’t think the story had to mention alternative treatments for all the myriad problems that chai yok can supposedly help with. But since the story suggests in several places that chai yok increases fertility, we think a brief mention of other approaches that are supported by medical evidence would have been appropriate in this case. The story didn’t provide this information. The story identifies several spas in Los Angeles and New York where vaginal steam baths are offered. It notes that the treatments “are not easy to find” across the country. The story acknowledges the roots of chai-yok in Korean medicine.The approach is described as extremely avant garde in the U.S. — a characterization which is probably accurate. Given the variety of sources quoted, we can be sure the story wasn’t based on a press release. Claim: Vaginal steam bath finds a place among Southern California spa options Student:","output":"To explain the given claim \\"Vaginal steam bath finds a place among Southern California spa options,\\" we can follow these steps: 1. Firstly, the paragraph mentions several spas in Los Angeles and New York where vaginal steam baths are offered, supporting the claim about their growing presence in Southern California spa options. 2. The text acknowledges the roots of the vaginal steam bath (chai-yok) practice as originating in Korean medicine, further emphasizing the treatment's presence in Southern California's diverse wellness landscape. 3. Additionally, the paragraph describes the approach as extremely avant-garde in the U.S., which implies that vaginal steam baths are recognized as a unique and emerging spa trend within the region. 4. While providing caution regarding the lack of evidence supporting potential health benefits, the explanation could also point out that the availability of these treatments in spas indicates a demand and market for them in Southern California. In conclusion, the paragraph supports the claim by mentioning the presence of vaginal steam baths in spas located in Los Angeles and New York, along with the treatment's roots in Korean medicine and its avant-garde status in the U.S., thus highlighting the growing trend of this therapy in Southern California spa options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The second American Basketball Association All-Star Game was played on January 28, 1969 at Louisville Convention Center, now  Louisville Gardens, a multi-purpose, 6,000-seat arena, in Louisville, Kentucky, that opened in 1905, as what? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Second American Basketball Association (ABA) All-Star Game, held on January 28, 1969, took place at the esteemed Louisville Convention Center, now known as the Louisville Gardens. This historic event transpired within the confines of a multipurpose, 6,000-seat arena nestled in the heart of Louisville, Kentucky. The venue's rich history harks back to its establishment in 1905, marking it as a prominent destination for various forms of entertainment and athletic events throughout the years.  Initially, the Louisville Convention Center opened its doors as the Jefferson County Armory, a building primarily designed to serve as a military installation for local troops and storage for munitions. In its early days, the armory played host to a range of public events, including political rallies and concerts, in addition to its duties as a military hub. Given the diversity of activities held within its walls, the Jefferson County Armory set the stage for the community-oriented transformation of the Louisville Convention Center and Louisville Gardens in the years to come. As time went on, the building gained popularity and evolved into a thriving commercial space. By the 1950s, it shed its military moniker and rebranded as the Louisville Convention Center. Through its metamorphosis, the venue expanded its range of events, becoming increasingly known for hosting a variety of sports competitions, including basketball, boxing, wrestling, and more. Furthermore, it accommodated conventions, trade shows, and even concerts, hosting well-known artists such as Elvis Presley and The Beatles. In the instance of the Second ABA All-Star Game, the event boasted a thrilling lineup of basketball players who showcased their skills and talents on the court. This marked a significant milestone in the venue's history, as it demonstrated the Louisville Convention Center's growth as a versatile and notable location for different types of events, including top-tier professional sporting engagements. The ABA game also played a role in solidifying the venue's connection with the world of professional basketball, ultimately contributing to the rich history and tradition of the Louisville Gardens. Today, the Louisville Gardens continues to operate as a multi-purpose, 6,000-seat arena, regularly hosting an assortment of events such as concerts, trade shows, political gatherings, and of course, sports competitions. Its longevity and sustained success stand as a testament to the transformative power and adaptability of the facility as it has thrived through various stages of development, remaining a central hub for entertainment and sports throughout the decades."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After his mother has no end of medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the mob. What fallows is a series of gags, most of which work, there are, however, the occasional flops. But a foreign gangster who can't master the American language (profanity wise, at least), a rival gangster with a penchant for shooting his mouth off (...once!), a younger brother with the D.A. who is out to get Johhny Dangerously, and a hot young starlet hot for his affections have Johnny busy. And the viewer will be busy laughing, for the most part, as every gangster-movie cliché is skewered by a talented cast and decent writing. Not perfect by a long shot, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be analyzed step-by-step: 1. The review starts by comparing the movie \\"Johnny Dangerously\\" to other parody films, mentioning that it's a breath of fresh air among recent horrid parodies. This suggests a positive sentiment regarding \\"Johnny Dangerously.\\" 2. The review gives a brief summary of the plot and then proceeds to explain that the film has a series of gags that mostly work, with the occasional flop. This suggests both positive and negative sentiments - the gags are appreciated, but the presence of flops detracts from the overall enjoyment. 3. The review highlights certain memorable features, such as the foreign gangster, rival gangster, and Johnny's love interest.

The reviewer states that the viewer will be busy laughing for the most part, which further strengthens the positive sentiment in the review. 5. Lastly, the review acknowledges that the movie is not perfect but is good for a smile on a bad day. This again suggests a positive sentiment with a slight negative note regarding the film's imperfections. Overall, the sentiment of this review can be considered mostly positive, with some minor negative aspects. The reviewer appreciates the film amidst other inferior parodies, enjoys the gags and memorable characters, and finds it to be good for a smile, despite its imperfections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His uncle","output":"Title: The Price of Passage Genre: Drama, Mystery, Family Plot: Act 1 In the bustling streets of Hong Kong, Hong, a hardworking young man, dreams of seeking a better life in the United States. Determined to provide for his single mother Jiang and the rest of his family, Hong vigorously works multiple jobs to save up for his ticket to America. Unfortunately, the mountains of loans and obligations of the family make it impossible to save enough money for his dream. Thoughts about leaving his hometown behind and starting fresh in the United States, Hong is unexpectedly approached by his estranged, wealthy uncle Edward, who appears outside their doorstep one evening. Edward offers to pay for Hong's passage to the States to begin a new life and even hints at a well-paying job waiting for him there. Suspicious about his uncle's sudden kindness and generosity, Hong hesitates but ultimately takes up the offer to help his mother and younger siblings escape their life of poverty. Act 2 Hong arrives in San Francisco, where he witnesses the new culture, the opportunities, and the challenges that await him. He starts working for his uncle's import and export business in Chinatown, which becomes a vital source for Chinese immigrants and businesses in the city. As Hong delves deeper into the family business, he slowly uncovers the hidden truth that the company is a front for an extensive international smuggling ring. Although disturbed by the discovery, Hong justifies his participation in these criminal activities for the sake of his family's well-being. Back in Hong Kong, Hong's mother Jiang receives regular payments from her son and is grateful for the help. The monetary support starts changing their lives for the better as they can now afford basics and even occasional luxuries. In contrast, Hong's heart grows increasingly heavy with guilt as his new life path digs him deeper into the world of crime. Act 3 One day, an FBI raid at the warehouse where Hong works results in the arrest of key players in Edward's smuggling operation, causing the whole operation to crumble like a house of cards. Fortunately, Hong escapes the scene barely unseen, but he is now on the run. An unexpected call from his mother reveals that his family has been receiving threats and demands to repay Edward's initial generosity they were unaware of, forcing Hong to face the true cost of the passage his uncle provided. Hong determines he will do everything he needs to protect his family from the dangerous ramifications of his uncle's business. Act 4 In a series of daring and decisive moves, Hong risks everything to dismantle his uncle Edward's entire criminal empire. As the plot unravels, it is revealed that Edward had been blackmailing his brother, Hong's father, which ultimately led him to disappear, leaving the family behind in Hong Kong. Fuelled by the heartfelt need to set things right for his family and his missing father's sake, Hong manages to gather enough evidence on his uncle's illicit activities to submit it to the authorities discreetly. This results in Edward's arrest and ultimately the dismantling of the entire operation. Act 5 Despite the immense challenges he faced, Hong manages to find his father, who had fled and gone into hiding out of fear. Hong reunites his family, who agrees to start a new chapter in their lives together in the United States. However, the events of the past weigh heavy on Hong, and he has to reconcile with the fact that he traded one set of problems for another. Hong uses his newfound knowledge of import-export and the money he saved to start a legitimate business that promotes fair trade and provides ethical goods to Chinese immigrants and locals alike. He takes pride in creating a business that enables him and his family to live honorable, fulfilling lives while also helping others. The movie ends with Hong's realization that the price of passage is not only what you pay but also the values you compromise or uphold on the journey."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What moves horizontally? Context: Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.

The rating means 1: extremely poor, 2: poor, 3: neutral or mixed, 4: good, 5: extremely good.  FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES  When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.  IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE  Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, \\"100 calorie packs\\" -- 4.5 inches across!  WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + \\"ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS\\" & \\"ARTIFICIAL COLORS\\" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL  2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES  BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES  As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history. A:","output":"Task: Generate a rating for a food product on a scale of 1-5 based on the given review.

Rating: Based on the details provided in the review and the guidelines, we can conclude that the product deserves a rating of 4 (good). The reviewer mentions that these wafers are a good option for a minimalistic snack and provide an alternative to more calorie-dense options, making it good for diet-conscious people.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What was the disagreement between Athanasius and others in the Christian faith?\\"  Context: \\"Throughout most of his career, Athanasius had many detractors. Classical scholar Timothy Barnes relates contemporary allegations against Athanasius: from defiling an altar, to selling Church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and even violence and murder to suppress dissent. Athanasius used \\"Arian\\" to describe both followers of Arius, and as a derogatory polemical term for Christians who disagreed with his formulation of the Trinity. Athanasius called many of his opponents \\"Arian\\", except for Miletus.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The disagreement between Athanasius and others in the Christian faith primarily revolved around the nature of the Trinity and the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. This theological dispute became known as the Arian controversy. Step 1: Understand the context provided  In the text provided, it describes that Athanasius had many detractors throughout his career, and he used the term \\"Arian\\" to describe both followers of Arius as well as Christians who disagreed with his views on the Trinity. Step 2: Identify the main point of disagreement The main point of disagreement between Athanasius and other Christians is the formulation of the Trinity. Specifically, the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. Step 3: Explain Athanasius' position Athanasius, as a staunch defender of the Nicene Creed, argued for the homoousios doctrine, which states that Jesus Christ and God the Father are of the same substance and therefore co-eternal and co-equal. Step 4: Explain the opposing view On the other hand, Arius and his followers believed that Jesus Christ was not of the same substance as God the Father, but rather a created being, subordinate to and distinct from the Father. This view was known as Arianism. Step 5: Present the answer  The disagreement between Athanasius and others in the Christian faith was primarily centered around the nature of the Trinity and the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. Athanasius advocated for the homoousios doctrine, which states that Jesus Christ and God the Father are of the same substance, while his opponents, including those labeled as \\"Arians,\\" believed in the subordination of Jesus Christ to God the Father, denying the co-equality and co-eternality of the two."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have: 0 = -6 * b + 5 * b - 2 First, we need to add the b's together. It's like having -6 apples and adding 5 apples. If you had 6 apples and someone took away 6 apples and then gave you 5 apples, you would have 5 apples left, but since it was -6 initially, we have -1 apples. So it becomes: 0 = -1 * b - 2 Now, we want to find what 'b' is. Imagine we had -1 toy multiplied by a number (that's our 'b') and we added 2 more toys to the toys we already had, we would have a total of 0 toys. So the question is, how many toys did we start with? To find out, we need to add 2 to each side: 0 + 2 = -1 * b - 2 + 2 This becomes: 2 = -1 * b Now, let's think: What number, when we multiply it by -1, gives us 2? It's like we had -1 bags of candy, and we added some amount of candy (our 'b') and in the end, we got 2 bags of candy. If we guess that 'b' is -2, when -2 is multiplied by -1, we get 2.

This easy-to-follow guide will walk you through the process of creating a refreshing, cold glass of iced tea in just a few simple steps. You'll need a mug, boiling water, tea bags, ice, and optional garnishes. Step 1: Fill the mug with boiling water Begin by boiling water on the stovetop or in an electric kettle. Carefully pour about ½ cup (120 milliliters) of the boiling water into a heatproof mug. The use of a heatproof mug is essential, as regular mugs may crack or break when exposed to boiling water. Step 2: Brew the tea Next, select your desired tea bag. Popular choices include black tea, green tea, or herbal tea. Place the tea bag into the mug containing the boiling water and let it steep for 3 minutes. This will allow the flavors and benefits of the tea to be fully extracted and infused into the water. Step 3: Remove the tea bag Once the tea has brewed for 3 minutes, carefully remove the tea bag using a spoon or tongs. Make sure to give the tea bag a gentle squeeze to release any remaining liquid and flavors back into the mug. Discard the used tea bag. Step 4: Prepare the glasses While the tea is still hot, grab 1 to 2 glasses, depending on how much iced tea you want to serve. Fill these glasses with ice, almost to the brim. Using a sufficient amount of ice will ensure that the tea cools rapidly, without diluting the tea too much. Step 5: Pour and garnish Once your glasses are filled with ice, slowly pour the hot brewed tea over the ice. The tea should instantly start to cool, producing a refreshing iced beverage. If desired, garnish your iced tea with a sprig of mint, a slice of lemon, or even some fresh berries. This not only adds visual appeal but can also add a pleasant aroma and tantalizing flavors to your drink. Step 6: Serve and enjoy Finally, serve the iced tea to your guests or enjoy it yourself. The simple yet satisfying taste of a well-made iced tea is perfect for those hot summer days or whenever you need a refreshing break. In conclusion, making iced tea is a quick and easy process that can be done with just a few basic ingredients and steps. Start with boiling water, brew your favorite tea, pour it over ice, garnish if desired, and serve! This refreshing beverage is perfect for social gatherings or quiet moments of personal enjoyment.

Movie title: Beneath Hill 60 Movie plot: As seen in flashbacks that occur throughout the film, Oliver Woodward is an Australian miner supplying copper for the war effort. He falls in love with Marjorie Waddell, a young woman ten years his junior. However, he is under constant pressure to enlist, especially from Waddell's father. He has the opportunity to do so when the British Army forms the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company to supplement the Royal Engineers; Woodward is commissioned to lead the unit. On the Western Front, Woodward meets Frank Tiffin, a young Australian soldier who is suffering from shell shock. Woodward reassigns Tom Dwyer and Norman Morris to relieve Tiffin. Two German tunnelers break through into the tunnel. Morris and Dwyer dispatch both of them, but Dwyer is killed when a German explosive goes off, bringing down the tunnel on top of them; Morris is rescued by the other sappers. Woodward is later tasked with destroying the Red House, a fortified German position raining enfilade fire down upon the frontmost section of the British trenches. Although Woodward initially proposed tunneling beneath the Red House, his commanding officer, Colonel Wilson Rutledge, insisted that it be done by dawn. Along with Corporal Bill Fraser and Morris, Woodward crosses No Man's Land. They manage to reach the Red House and plant explosives underneath it. However, as they make their way back to the British lines, they discover that the reel of cable is too short, so Morris runs ahead to retrieve the exploder. While they wait, they discover mortally wounded Lieutenant Robert Clayton, who had been ordered to cut a gap in the wire obstacle for them. Morris arrives with the exploder and they destroy the Red House. The next day, after a friendly game of rugby league against some British soldiers, Woodward is promoted to captain and he subsequently promotes Fraser to Sergeant, he later receives word that they are to be moved up the lines to the Ypres Salient.

So, \\"I clamped my hand over my nose\\" is the correct reaction to the situation described. The other option \\"I put the rubber gloves on\\" is incorrect because it is not directly related to the effect of a bad odor. Rubber gloves are typically used as a protective layer on hands to avoid direct contact with harmful substances or bacteria.

Question: Which units are best to measure the amount of rain that fell during a thunderstorm? Answer:","output":"To determine the best units for measuring the amount of rain that fell during a thunderstorm, the ideal approach would involve the following steps: Step 1: Identify the common units used for measuring rainfall Common units for measuring rainfall include millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), inches (in), and meters (m). These units come from the International System of Units (SI) and the Imperial System. Step 2: Consider the scale and accuracy needed for measuring rainfall Rainfall is usually measured in smaller units to allow for greater accuracy in measurement. Since rainfall amounts are generally smaller numbers (not typically measured in whole meters), using smaller units such as millimeters, centimeters, or inches makes more sense. Step 3: Evaluate the consistency with global standards Globally, rain gauges and meteorological reports utilize the metric system (SI) for measurements. Considering this widespread usage, using metric units ensures consistency and a simpler conversion between different units when comparing data across different regions and countries. Step 4: Choose the ideal unit based on the above criteria Given the need for accuracy, consistency with global standards, and the scale of rainfall, millimeters (mm) is the best unit for measuring the amount of rain that fell during a thunderstorm. Millimeters provide the appropriate level of granularity for rainfall measurements and are widely adopted in meteorological reports and systems."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: CBS newsman and 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer is retiring after more than 50 years.      The longest-serving 60 Minutes correspondent will formally retire this week, CBS announced on Wednesday, May 11, and the reporter, who began his career as a CBS regular in 1970, told Us Weekly via a statement that he's incredibly grateful for his amazing career.            Roger Kisby/Getty Images      “After more than 50 years of broadcasting on CBS News and 60 Minutes I have decided to retire,\\" the 84-year-old said. \\"It’s been a wonderful run, but the time has come to say goodbye to all of my friends at CBS and the dozens of people who kept me on the air,\\" he added. “But most of all I thank the millions of people who have been loyal to our broadcast.”      Safer's unparalleled work will be celebrated in an hourlong special, Morley Safer: A Reporter’s Life, which will air following the Sunday, May 15, regular edition of 60 Minutes.            “Morley has had a brilliant career as a reporter and as one of the most significant figures in CBS News history, on our broadcast and in many of our lives,” Jeff Fager, executive producer of 60 Minutes, said. “Morley’s curiosity, his sense of adventure and his superb writing all made for exceptional work done by a remarkable man. The best of Morley Safer will be on display in our special broadcast this Sunday.”            The show will trace Safer’s life, from his birth in Toronto through his rise in the 1950s and '60s as a distinguished war reporter to his time as a 60 Minutes correspondent.

The International Business Times story below was initially published last week, after word of Safer's retirement plans.      Morley Safer is disconnecting his microphone.      The 84-year-old, longest-serving correspondent on “60 Minutes” is retiring after more than a half-century of covering the world, CBS News announced Wednesday.      “It’s been a wonderful run, but the time has come to say goodbye to all of my friends at CBS and the dozens of people who kept me on the air,” Safer told CBS News. “But most of all I thank the millions of people who have been loyal to our broadcast.”      “Morley has had a brilliant career as a reporter and as one of the most significant figures in CBS News history, on our broadcast and in many of our lives,” Jeff Fager, executive producer of “60 Minutes,” said in a statement.      Unlike the current age of digital journalism that all too frequently requires online users to cobble together an understanding of news events through a stream of abbreviated quick hits and short video takes, Safer’s work was based in an era that focused on carefully dissecting events and providing readers with a complete picture of a story in carefully crafted segments.      Safer may be best known for his work exposing the bleak tactics the U.S. employed during the Vietnam War that alienated the rural population in that country, trapped between the global forces of communism and capitalism during the Cold War. Just a year after joining CBS News in his early 30s in 1964, the Canadian-born reporter followed a group of U.S. Marines on a search-and-destroy mission in the village of Cam Ne. Safer showed Marines instructing locals in English to evacuate their homes as the troops casually light thatched huts afire with their cigarette lighters and flamethrowers.      The report helped mark the beginning of increasingly critical media coverage of the U.S. war in Southeast Asia. It angered President Lyndon B. Johnson so much, he had Safer investigated for ties to communism. When told by staffers that Safer was “just a Canadian,” the president replied, “Well, I knew he wasn’t American.”      Safer’s early big journalistic coup — few correspondents garner any attention from a U.S. president, much less get probed at the behest of one — was followed by a series of award-winning in-depth analyses and reports, including coverage of the Northern Ireland conflict in 1974 that spotlighted a divided town and a dive into the dark pool of art forgery.      Safer won more than two dozen awards, including 12 Emmys and the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for coverage of a school for the homeless.      Safer went on to produce hundreds of reports for “60 Minutes,” 919 of them in all. His last piece ran in March, a profile of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels.      While much of his work focused on covering global conflicts, exposing injustices or highlighting social issues, Safer often used his great command of the language to produce lighthearted pieces. After U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died this year in Marfa, Texas, Safer’s 2013 profile of the quirky desert town suddenly attracted new interest.      And what about those U.S. soldiers he covered back in 1965?      “[Safer] was all business and he reported what he saw ... We looked at eternity right in the face a couple times ... and he was as cool as a hog on ice,” U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Joe Stringham told CBS News for a segment about Safer’s career that “60 Minutes” will present Sunday at 8 p.m. EDT. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"CBS newsman and 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer has announced his retirement after a career spanning over 50 years.

News article: Revolve Clothing Model Incites Weight Debate Firestorm      While we clearly love calling out a good Photoshop Disaster, the most recent submission to our Tips box is anything but. A model on RevolveClothing.com has found herself the subject of some serious scrutiny in the comments section — and not because of concerns over post-production editing, but, perhaps more sadly, because of her health.      There are almost twenty reviews on BCBG’s leather and mesh drape dress — none of which have anything to do with the dress. Instead, they are focused almost entirely on the model’s body and they range from the unfortunately derogatory (“Gross!”) to the genuinely concerned.      Says one:      I’m not going to join in with the “ews” or the “disgustings!” or the “feed her!” comments, but as someone who has dealt with her own body image issues in the past (like many women have), this makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable.      The model in question appears to be Allie Crandell, who is perhaps most well-known for her somewhat single season tenure on The City — Whitney Port’s New York- and fashion-based spinoff of The Hills. Worse yet, Allie’s storyline on the docu-drama featured an anorexia-focused showdown between her and the queen of PR and tough love, Kelly Cutrone. Crandell eventually left the show, telling New York Magazine she wanted to focus on “herself… and [her] career.”      Crandell is certainly slim — and slimmer than what most would consider naturally possible, though let’s not forget Ann of ANTM fame — but it’s somewhat fascinating to see what a nerve her image has struck with the customers of the site, and what it is about that image in particular that really got people going. (Crandell appears on at least nine different BCBG pages, none of which have any comments along the same lines.)

Given the question: Question: \\"Which place was NOT a destination of the Great Migration?\\"  Context: \\"Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The question asks which place was NOT a destination of the Great Migration. The context provided discusses the racial conflict and discrimination that developed in Detroit during the 20th century, and how the Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South to the city. It also mentions the influx of southern and eastern European immigrants of Catholic and Jewish faith who competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing. The presence of the Ku Klux Klan and the Black Legion, both of which opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants as well as black Americans, further emphasizes the racial tensions in Detroit at the time.  Given this context, it is clear that Detroit was a destination for the Great Migration. However, to answer this question, we need to consider other places that were and were not destinations for this migration.  The Great Migration primarily refers to the movement of millions of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North during the early 20th century, particularly between 1916 and 1970. This was primarily driven by the demand for industrial labor in northern cities and the search for better social and economic opportunities.  Some of the key destinations of the Great Migration were: 1. Chicago, Illinois: As one of the major industrial cities in the North, Chicago attracted large numbers of African Americans from the South, leading to a significant demographic transformation. 2. New York City, New York: Another major center of economic opportunity, New York City also saw an influx of African Americans, leading to the cultural phenomenon known as the Harlem Renaissance. 3. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Philadelphia's booming industrial sector drew migrants from the South, leading to a significant increase in the city's African American population. Given the focus on northern, industrial cities, one place that was NOT a destination of the Great Migration would be cities in the rural South, from where many African Americans were migrating. For example, regions like the Mississippi Delta, which experienced significant population decline during this period, were not destinations for the Great Migration. Instead, these rural regions were the origin points for individuals and families in search of better opportunities in the urban North."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The world’s leading experts on climate change say fracking will cut greenhouse gas emissions and should be made central to the country’s energy production. It will help the UK move away from ‘dirty’ coal and contribute to saving the environment, according to a report by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report added that shale gas may provide electricity and heat for decades to come if scientists can safely develop a technology that traps CO2. A young protestor holds a placard at the entrance gate belonging to a site run by Cuadrilla Resources. The report says it is ‘quite clear’ that fracking is ‘very consistent with low-carbon development’ and the technology could ‘significantly’ reduce emissions. The unexpected endorsement from 235 eminent United Nations scientists and economists will be a welcome boost to David Cameron, who is a keen advocate of the new technology. It is also a blow to green activists, who seek cuts in greenhouse gas emissions but are concerned about the effects of fracking. The IPCC report, published yesterday in Berlin, says natural gas has a role to play for at least the next 35 years as a ‘bridge technology’ while the UK expands its use of wind and solar power. And it says shale may provide electricity and heat for our homes long beyond that if scientists can safely develop an emerging technology that traps carbon dioxide and stores it underground. It is also a blow to green activists, who seek cuts in greenhouse gas emissions but are concerned about the effects of fracking. The scientists say that wind, solar and hydroelectric power need to triple or even quadruple in scale over the next 35 years if global warming is to be safely controlled. But natural gas – whether drilled from conventional wells or extracted from fractured shale deep below the ground – also has a role because it emits roughly half the volume of greenhouse gases as coal. Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chairman of the IPCC authors, said: ‘The shale gas revolution can be very consistent with low-carbon development – that is quite clear. It can be very helpful as a bridge technology.’ The IPCC document is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change. It will inform the policy decisions of governments around the world and will also be used as a bargaining tool before next year’s UN climate conference in Paris, which aims to set legally-binding targets on every nation to reduce carbon emissions. Britain is thought to have vast reserves of shale gas trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground that can be extracted by firing water and chemicals to fracture rock. Campaigner Bianca Jagger with Vanessa Vine, Manna Mori, and Natalie Bennett leader of the Green Party England & Wales attending an anti-fracking protest in Westminster. Mr Cameron last month said he wanted shale gas wells to be up and running by the end of the year, although industry sources say commercial extraction is not likely until the end of the decade. But there have been fierce protests against the technique, with exploratory drilling near the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, abandoned last year after the site was overrun by demonstrators. The IPCC report is the third of three it has prepared on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. The first concluded that humans are almost certainly the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The second warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring’ across the world. Yesterday’s report said that by the end of the century global temperatures will rise to a level that will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet if no action is taken. It calls for massive investment in low-carbon alternatives worldwide of around £90billion a year and says governments will need to pour subsidies in to get systems off the ground. Nuclear power could make an ‘increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply’, the report finds, but says ‘operation risks’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘variety of barriers’. Last year in Britain, coal provided 36 per cent of electricity, gas provided 27 per cent, nuclear 20 per cent, oil 1 per cent and renewable sources 15 per cent. Highlights:","output":"- Climate scientists say that shale gas could help slow global warming. - Fracking may cut greenhouse gas emissions and be a part of energy production. - Shale gas could help the UK move away from coal and save the environment. - Shale gas could provide electricity and heat for a long time if CO2 can be trapped. - Wind, solar, and hydroelectric power need to grow to help control global warming. - Shale gas emits about half the greenhouse gases as coal. - The report calls for a big investment in low-carbon alternatives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And we know that a poem will live or die depending on how it is read. The readers, by the way, should not read poems without getting any practice. They should be given their poems a few days in advance so that they have time to practice, maybe in the presence of a teacher. Read the poem slowly. Most young people speak quickly, and a nervous reader will tend to do the same in order to get the reading over with. Reading a poem slowly is the best way to make sure that the poem will be read clearly and understood by its listeners. Learning to read a poem slowly will not always make the poem easier to hear, however. A poem should not be read too slowly, and a good way for a reader to set an easy pace is to pause for a few seconds between the title and the poem's first line.

Premise: \\"The higher level of expenditures is driven by a 21% increase in unit generation costs caused primarily by the emissions caps and offset only slightly by a small decrease in electricity demand.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Emissions caps have caused a price change in unit generations. \\"?","output":"If the given premise is true, it provides substantial evidence to support the hypothesis \\"Emissions caps have caused a price change in unit generations.\\" In the premise, it is mentioned that the higher level of expenditures is driven by a 21% increase in unit generation costs caused primarily by the emissions caps. This statement directly connects the implementation of emissions caps to the increase in unit generation costs, which in turn suggests that the hypothesis is accurate. First, it is crucial to understand the context of the premise. In this scenario, emissions caps are regulatory limits set on the amount of greenhouse gases that industries, such as power plants or manufacturing facilities, can emit. By implementing emissions caps, the aim is to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. The emissions caps can affect businesses by either forcing them to upgrade their equipment, use cleaner fuels, or buy allowances – or carbon credits – to meet the stipulated standards. Given the premise, it can be deduced that companies have faced higher operating costs due to the implementation of emissions caps. This increase in operating costs results from new investments or changes in production processes made to comply with the restrictions on emissions. For instance, industries may have had to invest in cleaner technologies, retrofit their operations to be more eco-friendly, or purchase emissions allowances. This increase in unit generation costs ultimately contributes to higher expenditures for businesses and leads to a consequential price change in unit generations. The premise suggests that the emissions caps have played a significant role in influencing the unit generation costs, with an increase of 21% being observed. Additionally, it is important to note that the premise mentions how the increase in unit generation costs caused by emissions caps is offset only slightly by a small decrease in electricity demand. This small decrease in demand may have dampened the desired effect of the emissions caps, as it may not be sufficiently strong to encourage businesses to prioritize investing in greener technologies. In other words, the emissions caps may have caused the price change, but demand has not responded strongly enough to counterbalance the increased costs. In conclusion, the given premise provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that emissions caps have caused a price change in unit generations. The 21% increase in unit generation costs corroborates the fact that forcing industries and businesses to comply with emissions caps has led them to incur higher operating costs, leading to an increase in the price of unit generations. Although there is mention of a slight decrease in electricity demand, the effect of emissions caps on unit generation costs is the primary factor in driving the price change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I never wanted to be “that woman“. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn’t last long. But, that’s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn’t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn’t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive. I told my husband that I’d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn’t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it’s just not in him to love me that way.

When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them. what I responded to mrs D Pick the correct answer from the following options: - I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill - I owe my early entry into the world to South Hill - I owe my early entry into the world to Pontiac Hill - not enough information","output":"In response to Mrs. D, I would choose the following answer: - I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill This is because according to the story you shared, the incident involving your parents driving the borrowed Pontiac and encountering a moose on the slippery road happened at Tabusintac Hill. This event was the one that led to your early arrival in the world, and it supports your rebuttal to Mrs. D's teasing remarks about your birth date."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"William Shippen, an eminent American physician, was born on October 1, 1712, in Philadelphia, Province of Pennsylvania. Renowned for his work in the field of anatomy and his contributions to medicine, Shippen played a significant role in the medical community during his time. Born to a well-established family in Philadelphia, Shippen's early years laid the foundation for his future academic accomplishments. His passion for medicine led him to pursue a career in this field, focusing on the study of anatomy. As a young man, Shippen traveled to Europe to receive a proper education, attending prestigious institutions and acquiring invaluable knowledge to bring back to the American colonies. Upon his return to Philadelphia, Shippen made a name for himself as a physician and an educator. He became a prominent figure in the community, imparting his knowledge of anatomy to aspiring young doctors through lectures and practical demonstrations. At a time when the significance of anatomy was just beginning to be realized, Shippen's teachings were groundbreaking, positioning him as an influential pioneer in the field. His dedication to medicine and education eventually led to the establishment of the first medical school in the American colonies. Shippen, along with his contemporaries, was instrumental in founding the College of Philadelphia's medical department, which later became the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine – a prestigious institution known for its commitment to medical research and education. Outside his academic achievements, Shippen was also a devoted family man. He married and had children, one of whom, William Shippen Jr., followed in his father's footsteps and made his own mark in the medical field. William Shippen Jr. played an important role during the Revolutionary War as the first Surgeon General of the Continental Army, ensuring that Shippen's contributions to medicine extended beyond his own lifetime. In his later years, Shippen continued to work and teach in the field of medicine until his death on November 4, 1801, in Germantown, Philadelphia. With a life dedicated to the advancement of medical knowledge and the betterment of his fellow citizens, William Shippen's legacy remains an essential part of American medical history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Goring was born on 12 January 1893 at the Marienbad Sanatorium in Rosenheim, Bavaria. His father, Heinrich Ernst Goring (31 October 1839 - 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of South-West Africa (modern-day Namibia). Heinrich had five children from a previous marriage. Goring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859-15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. Goring and other senior officers were concerned that Germany was not yet ready for war, but Hitler insisted on pushing ahead as soon as possible. The invasion of Poland, the opening action of World War II, began at dawn on 1 September 1939. Later in the day, speaking to the Reichstag, Hitler designated Goring as his successor as Fuhrer of all Germany, \\"If anything should befall me\\", with Hess as the second alternate. Big German victories followed one after the other in quick succession. With the help of the Luftwaffe, the Polish Air Force was defeated within a week. The Fallschirmjager seized vital airfields in Norway and captured Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium. Goring's Luftwaffe played critical roles in the Battles of the Netherlands, Belgium and France in May 1940.  After the Fall of France, Hitler awarded Goring the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross for his successful leadership. During the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony, Hitler promoted Goring to the rank of Reichsmarschall des Grossdeutschen Reiches (Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich), a special rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military, including the Luftwaffe. As a result of his promotion, he was then the top ranking soldier of all Germany until the end of the war. Goring had already received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe.  The UK had declared war on Germany immediately after the invasion of Poland. In July 1940, Hitler began preparations for an invasion of Britain. As part of the plan, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had to be neutralized. Bombing raids commenced on British air installations and on cities and centres of industry. Goring had by then already announced in a radio speech, \\"If as much as a single enemy aircraft flies over German soil, my name is Meier!\\", something that would return to haunt him, when the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940. Though he was confident the Luftwaffe could defeat the RAF within days, Goring, like Admiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine (navy), was pessimistic about the chance of success of the planned invasion (codenamed Operation Sea Lion). Goring hoped that a victory in the air would be enough to force peace without an invasion. The campaign failed, and Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940. After their defeat in the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe attempted to defeat Britain via strategic bombing. On 12 October 1940 Hitler cancelled Sea Lion due to the onset of winter. By the end of the year, it was clear that British morale was not being shaken by the Blitz, though the bombings continued through May 1941. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was his success?","output":"Goring's success, as mentioned in the article, was his successful leadership during the Fall of France. After this event, Hitler awarded Goring the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross for his achievements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: I was the youngest of five boys and also had four sisters who had to pull together and take care of each other. Dad wasn't around, so I never knew him well. He killed himself when I was three years old, leaving mom with the job of raising nine kids. She was a very hard worker, and in order to make ends meet, she hardly ever rested. With my mom as my example, I learned that hard work is the best way to get what you want. Even as a little boy, I knew I was going to be successful. Regardless of what I chose, I wanted to make my brothers, sisters and mom proud of me--not only by being successful in what I chose to do, but also as a person who could be looked up to for the right reasons. Surprising as it might seem, basketball wasn't in my plans. One day, my mom cut a rim  off an old water barrel  and then held it up for me to throw an old rubber ball through. By junior high, I started playing basketball on a team. I loved to compete. For me, it paid off. I always put the effort in, every day. I am grateful for the life I've enjoyed as a basketball star. Basketball is not life. It can be exciting. But the most important thing about basketball is that it gives me a way to do good things for others as I move through this journey called life.

Write a text based on this summary: state is an elusive concept Text:","output":"The concept of a \\"state\\" has been a subject of great debate and contemplation in various fields and disciplines, ranging from political science to sociology, and even in the realm of moral philosophy. It is often seen as a complex and ambiguous idea, embodying a multitude of aspects and dimensions – making it an elusive concept to definitively pin down. The intricacies of different opinions, perspectives, and arguments surrounding the state have led many experts and thinkers to delve deeper into the analysis of this seemingly simple yet convoluted notion. At its core, the state is arguably an organizational structure that fulfills a set of functions and governance within a specific territory. This basic definition, however, does not adequately encompass the vast intricacies and variations that exist in the concept and the reality of states. The ever-changing political, social, and cultural landscapes within nation-states and the global community have contributed to the evolving nature of the state, making it difficult for scholars to arrive at a consensus. One argument that has gained traction in recent decades is that the state could be considered both an institution and an idea. While it is composed of tangible elements such as elected officials, government structures, and agencies, it is also an abstract concept in the minds of citizens and political actors. The state is imagined by the population it serves – a constantly evolving idea that transcends sociopolitical barriers and experiences growth or contraction depending on a range of factors, including the implementation of policies, economic shifts, and ideological changes within the society. In a globalized world where cross-border interactions are increasingly the norm, the notion of sovereignty is facing tremendous challenges. The existence of international organizations, the ever-growing importance of transnational actors, and the rise of non-state actors, such as global civil society and multinational corporations, have added layers of complexity to the traditional notion of the state. These developments have raised questions about the power and authority of states and the relevance of national borders in the contemporary era. Additionally, diverse historical, cultural, and social factors have led to significant variations in how states operate and function. While the role of the state in Western liberal democracies may center on the protection of individual liberties and the maintenance of a market economy, other states may prioritize community values, collective welfare, or even ideologies of nationalism or socialism. Although states may share similar characteristics, their agendas, goals, and methods may vary drastically from one another. A further dimension to the elusiveness of the concept of the state is its behavior and relationship towards its citizens. Different states exhibit different degrees of responsiveness to the needs and demands of their populations – in some cases, providing social welfare, security, and opportunity for socioeconomic development – while others may neglect or even repress the very citizens they claim to serve. The legitimacy or acceptance of the rule of the state by its citizens is often an important factor that shapes how the state operates, offering another layer of complexity to the conceptualization of the state.  Overall, the state is an elusive concept, not only due to its multifaceted nature but also because it constantly evolves and shapes itself according to the unique circumstances of particular territories. As an object of academic inquiry, political debate, and ideological contention, the state will inevitably continue to provoke reflection, critical analysis, and debate. Perhaps, amidst such discourses, we can develop an ever-evolving understanding and appreciation of this indispensable yet enigmatic cornerstone of modern human civilization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"She is taller than the wardrobe.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"She is taller than the wardrobe\\" is true. The premise establishes certain aspects of the scenario involving the girl and the wardrobe, but does not provide explicit information about their relative heights, nor can the information be deduced implicitly.  Let's examine the premise in detail to understand the context and establish what we can infer from it: 1. The wardrobe is described as \\"big,\\" which indicates that it is larger than an average wardrobe, but the exact dimensions are not provided. Without clear numerical values, we cannot determine its height nor compare it to that of the girl. 2. The wardrobe is said to \\"loom up\\" before the girl's eyes, which suggests that it might be comparatively taller than her since they often use the word \\"loom\\" to describe an object that appears imposing or threatening in its size, specifically because it towers over other objects or people. However, this is not necessarily conclusive evidence, as the wardrobe's perceived height could be emphasized by factors such as shadows, lighting, or position. 3. The adjective \\"sinister\\" has been used to depict the wardrobe's appearance. This can evoke a feeling of uneasiness, dread, or intimidation in the viewer - in this case, the girl. The wardrobe's sinister presentation certainly indicates its imposing stature relative to her, but it does not offer any solid evidence to prove that she is taller. To conclude, the information provided in the premise is insufficient to corroborate the hypothesis that \\"She is taller than the wardrobe.\\" To make such a determination, more specific data concerning the girl's height and the wardrobe's dimensions are required. While the premise suggests that the wardrobe appears imposing and sinister in the context, it offers no quantifiable evidence to validate the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Malian \\"Spiderman\\" rescues Paris child - then meets French president      A Malian migrant, hailed as a hero after mounting a daring rescue to save a small boy dangling from a balcony in Paris, is to be made a French citizen.      Mamoudou Gassama won widespread praise after climbing the outside of the building to save the four-year-old.      Video showed him being cheered on by spectators as he pulled himself from balcony to balcony to the fourth floor.      After meeting him at the Elysee Palace, President Emmanuel Macron said he would be made a naturalised citizen.      He personally thanked Mr Gassama, gave him a medal for courage and said he would also be offered a role in the fire service.      Mr Gassama is said to have arrived in France last year, taking the long and dangerous journey to Europe via a boat over the Mediterranean to Italy.      The drama that thrust him to fame unfolded on Saturday evening on a street in the north of the city.      Mr Gassama said he had been walking past when he saw a crowd gathered in front of the building.      He told Mr Macron: \\"I just didn't have time to think, I ran across the road to go and save him.      You may also like:      \\"I just climbed up and thank God, God helped me. The more I climbed the more I had the courage to climb up higher, that's it,\\" he added.      He said that the boy was crying when he hauled him to safety and had also suffered an injured foot.      Firefighters arrived to find the child had already been rescued.      \\"Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,\\" a spokesperson said.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Gassama met French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday      Image copyright AFP Image caption Outside the presidential palace he showed off a certificate he was given      Local authorities quoted by French media said the boy's parents were not at home at the time.      The father has been questioned by police on suspicion of leaving his child unattended, judicial sources say. The mother was not in Paris at the time, it is believed.      Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was among those to praise the 22-year-old's heroism and said she had called him to thank him.      She referred to him as the \\"Spiderman of the 18th\\", referring to the Paris district where the rescue took place, calling him an \\"example for all citizens\\".      France's new Malian hero      Alex Duval Smith, West Africa correspondent, BBC News      Mr Gassama's four-storey dash is a reminder of another Malian hero who gained national prominence in January 2015 during an extremist attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris.      A young Malian employee, Lassana Bathily, was credited with saving the lives of six hostages including a baby when he led them to a safe hiding place, escaped, then directed gendarmes to their rescue.      Two weeks later - after six years of struggling to secure legal residency in France - Mr Bathily was given a medal and a French passport by then President François Hollande.      In 2016, he wrote a book ''Je ne suis pas un heros'' (I am no hero) and created a charity whose first project was to provide irrigation for his home village in western Mali.      Like Mr Bathily's selfless leadership to save the hostages, Mr Gassama's heroic climb to save the boy cements the image of Mali as a country with a culture of old-fashioned public spiritedness. ||||| Footage shows Mamoudou Gassama, a Malian immigrant, climbing up to a fourth-floor balcony to bring the child to safety      A young man has been hailed a hero after he scaled the facade of a building to save a four-year-old child hanging from a fourth-floor balcony.

Footage of the rescue shows Gassama, 22, pulling himself up the building’s storeys from balcony to balcony as a man on the fourth floor tries to hold on to the child by leaning across from a neighbouring balcony.      On reaching the fourth floor, Gassama puts one leg over the balcony before reaching out with his right arm and grabbing the child.      Firefighters arrived at the scene to find the child had already been rescued.      “Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,” a fire service spokesman said.      Tracked down by reporters 24 hours after the rescue, Gassama said he had acted without thinking. “I saw all these people shouting, and cars sounding their horns. I climbed up like that and, thank God, I saved the child,” he said.      “I felt afraid when I saved the child ... [when] we went into the living room, I started to shake, I could hardly stand up, I had to sit down,” he added.      Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, praised him on Twitter for his “act of bravery” as well as phoning him personally to “thank him warmly”. She referred to him as the “Spider-Man of the 18th”, referring to the Paris district where the rescue happened.      “He explained to me that he had arrived from Mali a few months ago dreaming of building his life here,” she said. “I told him that his heroic act is an example to all citizens and that the city of Paris will obviously be very keen to support him in his efforts to settle in France,” she added.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Johansson's first leading role was as Amanda, the younger sister of a pregnant teenager who runs away from her foster home in Manny & Lo (1996) alongside Aleksa Palladino and her brother, Hunter. Her performance received positive reviews: one written for the San Francisco Chronicle noted, \\"[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson,\\" while critic Mick LaSalle, writing for the same paper, commented on her \\"peaceful aura\\", and believed, \\"If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress.\\" Johansson earned a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female for the role.  After appearing in minor roles in Fall and Home Alone 3 (both 1997), Johansson attracted wider attention for her performance in the film The Horse Whisperer (1998), directed by Robert Redford. The drama film, based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Nicholas Evans, tells the story of a talented trainer with a gift for understanding horses, who is hired to help an injured teenager played by Johansson. The actress received an \\"introducing\\" credit on this film, although it was her seventh role. On Johansson's maturity, Redford described her as \\"13 going on 30\\". Todd McCarthy of Variety commented that Johansson \\"convincingly conveys the awkwardness of her age and the inner pain of a carefree girl suddenly laid low by horrible happenstance\\". For the film, she was nominated for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress. She believed that the film changed many things in her life, realizing that acting is the ability to manipulate one's emotions. On finding good roles as a teenager, Johansson said it was hard for her as adults wrote the scripts and they \\"portray kids like mall rats and not seriously ... Kids and teenagers just aren't being portrayed with any real depth\\".  Johansson later appeared in My Brother the Pig (1999) and in the neo-noir, Coen brothers film The Man Who Wasn't There (2001). Her breakthrough came playing a cynical outcast in Terry Zwigoff's black comedy Ghost World (2001), an adaptation of Daniel Clowes' graphic novel of same name. Johansson auditioned for the film via a tape from New York, and Zwigoff believed her to be \\"a unique, eccentric person, and right for that part\\". The film premiered at the 2001 Seattle International Film Festival; it was a box office failure, but has since developed a cult status. Johansson was credited with \\"sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age\\" by an Austin Chronicle critic, and won a Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.  With David Arquette, Johansson appeared in the horror comedy Eight Legged Freaks (2002), about a collection of spiders that are exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow to gigantic proportions and begin killing and harvesting. After graduating from PCS that year, she applied to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts; she decided to focus on her film career when she was rejected.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People have generally viewed personal growth as a result or product that can easily be identified   and measured. The worker who gets a rise, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner who learns a new language--all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show for their efforts. By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as they meet with new experiences and unexpected obstacles  . In this process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to accept. In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to face the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may \\"fail\\" at first. How we see ourselves as we try a new way of being is extremely important to our ability to grow. Do we notice ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we're shy and indecisive? Then our sense of fear can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and we think we're slow to adapt to change or that we're not smart enough to deal with a new challenge. Then we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all. These feelings of insecurity   and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to change and grow.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas.

He meets two older hobos and introduces himself as Woody Guthrie. Woody carries around a guitar labeled \\"This Machine Kills Fascists\\" as did the real Woody Guthrie. Woody is traveling across country to fulfill his dream to be a singer. Woody tells the other hobos his life story.

Construction sites are generally outdoor settings, as construction primarily involves the development of infrastructure or buildings, which are built outdoors. 3. \\"An excavator vehicle forms the foreground\\": An excavator is a large, heavy piece of construction equipment primarily used for digging, grading, or moving large amounts of material, such as dirt or rubble, during construction projects. The fact that an excavator is present suggests that the work being done likely involves some form of outdoor excavation or land development, further reinforcing the notion that the construction workers are working outside.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. My thoughts on the movie, 9 It was not good, not good at all. Visually, it was great. I was pleased with the pacing, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? eh, kinda bland. Plot? It sucked. This movie seemed more new age crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science isn't portrayed any better. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything... but \\"souls\\" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? That's something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie... created with science... and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask, \\"Okay, so now what?\\" (or something similar). I couldn't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit. It was a \\"okay... it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let's get out of here as fast as possible!\\" type of exit. This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily. Any thought as to, \\"what's the point of that?\\" will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing. Okay... SPOILERS follow. So, basically, a scientist creates \\"the Machine\\" that is capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he is also at fault. He gave the Machine his intellect, but didn't give it his heart.  The Machine goes Skynet on humanity's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth, finally slowly powering down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets. Each one, containing a piece of the scientist's soul. The last one, #9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself, #2.  Well, #2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. #9 finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue #2.  They succeed. #9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life... pulling out #2's soul in the process. The movie then continues with action scenes with #9 trying to rescue his soul-yanked compatriots.  They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then rains and we see life returning back to the planet. Hunh?!? That makes no sense. None at all. Why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? Why did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a \\"soul\\" to fight the first.. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success.

In a tropical rainforest habitat, tigers may share their environment with animals such as elephants, rhinoceroses, various species of deer (like sambar and chital), wild boar, guar (Indian bison), langurs, macaques, and various species of birds, reptiles, and insects. Tigers are apex predators in this environment and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem by controlling the population of herbivores. In this habitat, they may also encounter other predators like leopards, dholes (Indian wild dogs), and crocodiles. In the grasslands and savannas of Asia, tigers can come across animals such as antelopes, barking deer, wild water buffaloes, and various bird species. They also share this environment with other predators, such as jackals, wolves, and smaller species of wild cats, like the fishing cat and jungle cat. In the temperate forests of Russia, particularly in the Russian Far East where Siberian tigers are found, the animals that they share their environment with include sika deer, roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, musk deer, goral, Siberian roe deer, Asiatic black bears, and Amur leopard. The Siberian tiger is the largest of all the tiger subspecies and, in this ecosystem, they are the dominant predators. Other smaller species, including rodents, amphibians, and various types of invertebrates, are also present in these environments, though they may not make up a significant part of the tiger's diet. In conclusion, the animals in a tiger's environment depend on the specific habitat they inhabit. Tigers coexist with diverse species in these ecosystems, ranging from large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses to smaller creatures like langurs and wild boar. As apex predators, tigers play a critical role in maintaining the balance within their respective ecosystems."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is go daddy.com?

Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood.  Now, I have a new situation: Adam and his older brother Chris were born almost 15 years apart from each other. Adam is 27 now which means Chris is 41.  Lately Chris has started noticing grey hairs come in.

The Eucharist (also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper, among other names) is a Christian rite that is considered a sacrament in most churches and an ordinance in others. According to the New Testament, the rite was instituted by Jesus Christ during his Last Supper; giving his disciples bread and wine during the Passover meal, Jesus commanded his followers to \\"do this in memory of me\\" while referring to the bread as \\"my body\\" and the wine as \\"my blood\\". Through the Eucharistic celebration Christians remember Christ's sacrifice of himself on the cross.  The elements of the Eucharist, bread (leavened or unleavened) and wine are consecrated on an altar (or table) and consumed thereafter. Communicants (that is, those who consume the elements) may speak of \\"receiving the Eucharist\\", as well as \\"celebrating the Eucharist\\". Christians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite, though they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present. While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the elements, Catholics believe that they actually become the body and blood of Christ (transubstantiation). Lutherans believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present \\"in, with, and under\\" the forms of the bread and wine (sacramental union). Reformed Christians believe in a real spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Others, such as the Plymouth Brethren, take the act to be only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper. 1.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Howard Brush Dean III (born November 17, 1948) is an American physician, author and retired politician who served as the 79th Governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and Chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2005 to 2009. Dean was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election. His implementation of the fifty-state strategy as head of the DNC is credited with the Democratic victories in the 2006 and 2008 elections. Afterward, he became a political commentator and consultant to McKenna Long & Aldridge, a law and lobbying firm. Dean graduated from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1971. As a freshman, he requested specifically to room with an African-American. The university housing office complied and Dean roomed with two Southern black students and one white student from Pennsylvania. One of Dean's roommates was Ralph Dawson, the son of a sheet metal worker in Charleston, South Carolina and today a New York City labor lawyer. Dawson said of Dean:  Unless you operated from a stereotypic understanding of the Yale white boy as rich, you wouldn't know that about Howard.... When it came to race- and I don't know whether this was a function of intent or just came naturally- Howard was not patronizing in any way. He was willing to confront in discussion what a lot of white students weren't. He would hold his ground. He would respect that I knew forty-two million times more about being black than he did. But that didn't mean he couldn't hold a view on something relating to civil rights that would be as valid as mine. There were lots of well-meaning people at Yale who wanted you to understand that they understood your plight; you'd get into a conversation and they would yield too soon, so we didn't get the full benefit of the exchange. Howard very much thought he was capable of working an issue through. He was inquisitive. And when he came to a conclusion he would be as strong as anybody else. I don't think he's stubborn. He's a guy who's always been comfortable in his own skin. That's something you still see in him today, and it gets him into some degree of controversy.  Though eventually eligible to be drafted into the military, he received a deferment for an unfused vertebra. He explained to Tim Russert on Meet the Press, \\"I was really in no hurry to join the military.\\" He briefly tried a career as a stockbroker before deciding on a career in medicine, completing pre-medicine classes at Columbia University. In 1974, Dean's younger brother Charlie, who had been traveling through southeast Asia at the time, was captured and killed by Laotian guerrillas, a tragedy widely reported to have an enormous influence in Dean's life; he wore his brother's belt every day of his presidential campaign.

Paragraph: The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ's toolkit and his beer. Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they'd taken down the crucifix. A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ's moving sermon. Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling's blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air. I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn't come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn't see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn't see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn't move, just stared and held his drink. The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm. I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong. Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn't come home.

Here is the result: \\"registration 8 july 2004 18:29\\" In general, converting text to lower case involves replacing every uppercase letter with its corresponding lowercase letter, while keeping other characters like numbers, spaces and symbols unchanged. For instance, the word \\"Hello\\" would be transformed to \\"hello\\" in lower case. Lower case letters are also known as minuscules, and the process of converting uppercase letters (majuscules) to minuscules is often used in tasks like data manipulation, sorting or comparison. It's particularly useful in case-insensitive environments, like programming languages or search engines, where \\"HELLO\\" and \\"hello\\" should be treated as the same keyword or variable. Most programming languages and tools provide built-in functions or methods for converting text to lower case, making it simple to handle if necessary. For example, you can use the toLowerCase() method in JavaScript, .lower() in Python, or .ToLower() in C#. To sum up, converting text to lower case means transforming uppercase letters to their corresponding lowercase versions while leaving other characters intact.

The film tells the story of middleweight boxer Rubin \\"The Hurricane\\" Carter, who was convicted of committing a triple murder in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. His sentence was set aside after he had spent nearly 20 years in prison. The film concentrates on Rubin Carter's life between 1966 and 1985. It describes his fight against the conviction for triple murder and how he copes with nearly 20 years in prison. A parallel plot follows Lesra Martin, an underprivileged Afro-American youth from Brooklyn, now living in Toronto. In the 1980s, the child becomes interested in Carter's life and circumstances after reading Carter's autobiography. He convinces his Canadian foster family to commit themselves to Carter's case. The story culminates with Carter's legal team's successful pleas to Judge H. Lee Sarokin of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In 1966, Rubin \\"The Hurricane\\" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer, expected by many fans to become the world's greatest boxing champion. When three victims, specifically the club's bartender and a male and a female customer, were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and interrogated by the police. Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis were innocent and thus, \\"were never suspects,\\" a man named Alfred Bello, a suspect himself in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of the triple homicide in the club, Carter was given three consecutive life sentences. The answer is:","output":"The Hurricane's sentence at the time of conviction was three consecutive life sentences."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

However, we do know a lot about languages, the languages of today and also the languages of earlier times. There are probably about 3,000 languages in the world today. Chinese is the language with the most speakers. English, Russian and Spanish are also spoken by many millions of people. On the other hand, some languages in the world have less than one hundred speakers. There are several important families of languages in the world. For example, most of the languages of Europe are in one large family called Indo-European. The original   language of this family was spoken about 4,500 years ago. Many of the present day languages of Europe and India are modern forms of the language of 4,500 yeas ago. Languages are always changing. The English of today is very different from the English of 500 years ago. In time some even died out completely.

The first statement, \\"Swimmers by a nearby wave along with one surfer on the wave\\" seems to describe a scene at a beach or an ocean, where swimmers are present close to a wave, and there is a surfer riding the wave. It creates an image of a coastal setting, populated by people engaging in water activities. This statement does not provide any information related to the act of whaling, killing whales, or the weapons used in such activities. The second statement, \\"whalers kill 1000 unarmed whales\\", presents a fact or claim about a specific event or practice in which whaling - the act of hunting whales - is involved. This statement seems to emphasize that the whales being targeted by the whalers do not have any means of defense or are \\"unarmed\\". To draw a connection between these two statements, we would require more context or information that can link the two together. For example, it needs some additional data showing a causal relationship between these activities or the possibility of a shared location, timeframe, or any common factors between swimmers and surfers, and whaling activities. In summary, the two statements provided do not inherently relate to one another based on the information given.

Q:-  Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained.  What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step in the process of maintaining the composition of blood and regulating its various components begins with the body's control systems. These systems continually monitor and adjust blood composition to maintain homeostasis, allowing the body to function properly. The kidneys play a vital role in this process with the help of other organs, hormones, and mechanisms. The primary steps involved in this process are as follows: 1. Detection of changes in blood composition: The body's sensory receptors, such as baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, are responsible for detecting any deviations in blood composition, volume, and pressure. Additionally, the pH and osmolarity of the blood are closely monitored by the body. 2. Communication: Upon detecting an imbalance, the sensory receptors send signals to the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, which acts as the main control center for homeostatic regulation. This information is processed and interpreted by the hypothalamus to determine the necessary adjustments. 3. Kidney function: The kidneys play a crucial role in regulating blood composition by filtering the blood and removing excess water, electrolytes, and waste products. The kidneys adjust filtration rate and reabsorption of substances to maintain a constant blood volume, electrolyte balance, blood pressure, and pH levels.  4. Release of hormones: Based on the signals received from the hypothalamus, the body releases specific hormones to regulate blood composition. For example, the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is released when the body needs to retain water, whereas aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of sodium and water. In addition, the kidneys release renin as part of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) to increase blood pressure when necessary. 5. Stimulation of red blood cell production: The kidneys produce erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. This hormone is released in response to low oxygen levels, ensuring that the blood has adequate oxygen-carrying capacity. 6. Regulation of calcium levels: The kidneys help maintain calcium levels in the blood by controlling the reabsorption of calcium back into the bloodstream. Additionally, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol, a form of vitamin D, work together to regulate calcium levels by increasing the absorption of calcium from the intestines and stimulating bone resorption, releasing calcium into the blood. Overall, the first step in regulating blood composition and maintaining homeostasis is the detection of changes in blood composition, which then activates a series of complex interactions involving the kidneys, hormones, and other organs to keep all components at optimal levels for the body's proper functioning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: A boy was unaware that a picture was being taken of him. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis that the boy was unaware that a picture was being taken of him. The premise simply describes a scene in which a boy dressed in a red and black shirt and black sandals is kicking his foot back while looking at the camera. It does not provide information about the boy's awareness or intention regarding the picture being taken. To analyze this further, let us consider different aspects of the premise and the hypothesis. First, let us examine the boy's actions. He is kicking his foot back and looking at the camera. Kicking his foot back could be interpreted as an intentional pose or a candid, spontaneous movement. Since both possibilities are plausible, we cannot determine the boy's awareness of the picture. Next, let's look at the boy's gaze. He is looking at the camera, which could indicate that he is aware of the camera and potentially the photograph being taken. However, it's also possible that he is looking in the camera's direction simply by coincidence or for another reason that has nothing to do with the picture being taken. Lastly, it is important to consider any additional context that might be available alongside the premise. Is there information about the setting, the photographer, or the events leading up to the scene that might help to clarify the boy's awareness or intentions? Without any such context, we are left with an incomplete understanding of the situation, and we can't definitively conclude whether the boy was aware or unaware of the picture being taken. In conclusion, while the premise does offer some information about the boy's actions and appearance, it does not provide enough evidence to conclusively determine the hypothesis that the boy was unaware of the picture being taken. Additional context or a clearer description of his actions and expressions could help to confirm or refute the hypothesis, but based on the provided premise alone, we must acknowledge that both possibilities remain plausible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Buffalo Springfield was a Canadian-American rock band active from 1966 to 1968 whose most prominent members were Stephen Stills, Neil Young, and Richie Furay. The band released three albums and several singles, including \\"For What It's Worth\\". The band combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion and psychedelic-rock influences, and, along with the Byrds, were part of the early development of folk-rock. With a name taken from a brand of steamroller, Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Dewey Martin (drums, vocals), Bruce Palmer (electric bass), Furay (guitar, vocals), and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). Chris Hillman of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the Whisky a Go Go to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from Sonny & Cher's management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records for a four-album contract with a 12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with Elektra Records and Warner Bros. Records, and arranged for the band to start recording at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood.  The first Buffalo Springfield single, \\"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the Top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own mono mix was superior to the stereo mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's eponymous album was released by the Atlantic subsidiary Atco in mono and in stereo in December 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.  In November 1966, Stills composed \\"For What It's Worth\\" in response to a protest that had turned into a riot following the closing of a nightclub called Pandora's Box on Sunset Strip. The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station KHJ soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a Top Ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song \\"Baby Don't Scold Me\\" with \\"For What It's Worth\\" and re-releasing the album. \\"For What It's Worth\\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc., Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was the album a success?","output":"Yes, the album was a success.

A:","output":"Willi Heinrich was born on August 9, 1920, in Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, a picturesque city in southwest Germany. Raised under the complexities of the pre-war Nazi Germany era, Willi eventually went on to serve in the German army during World War II as an Oberschütze, or Senior Rifleman. He enlisted in 1941 and served until the war concluded in 1945. Throughout his time in the military, he demonstrated a strong allegiance to Nazi Germany and later to West Germany. Willi was a member of a few different units, including the 1st Division Battalion, 228th Jäger Regiment, and the 101st Jäger. The Jäger units were light infantry or skirmisher type battalions in the German army - known for their swift movements and reconnaissance skills. Participating in various battles throughout World War II, Willi Heinrich sustained his fair share of injuries. One of his most notable achievements during his service was being awarded the Black Wound Badge, a decoration given to military personnel who had been wounded in action. After the war ended in 1945, Heinrich had to adjust to the new political divisions in Germany. He remained loyal to West Germany and lived through the period of reconstruction and the eventual reunification of the two Germanys. Willi Heinrich passed away at the age of 84 on July 12, 2005, in Karlsruhe, Germany. His life was shaped by some of the most significant historical events and political changes of the 20th century, giving testament to his resilience, patriotism, and strength in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because starfish, along with sea urchins, are echinoderms, and echinoderms are known for their lack of respiratory and excretory systems.  Echinoderms are marine invertebrates belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. This diverse group of organisms includes starfish (also known as sea stars or asteroids), sea urchins, and other related species. Echinoderms are characterized by their radial symmetry, which means their body has five or more similar parts arranged symmetrically around a central axis. One interesting feature of echinoderms is that they lack specialized respiratory and excretory systems typically found in other animals. In many echinoderms, these functions are performed by their water vascular system, which is a network of fluid-filled canals and tube feet that help in gas exchange and waste elimination. Oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse directly across the thin walls of the tube feet and canals, providing the necessary gas exchange for respiration, while waste products are also removed through this system. While other creatures in the provided list, such as insects, humans, fish, and barnacles, do have respiratory and excretory systems, each of these systems function differently depending on the specific organism. For example, humans use lungs for respiration and kidneys for excretion, while fish use gills for respiration and a combination of gills and kidneys for excretion. Ferns, being plants, have a completely different way of handling gas exchange and excretion. They possess specialized microscopic openings called stomata on their leaves and stems, which facilitate the exchange of gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen with the atmosphere. Waste products in plants are often stored in specialized cells or compartments within the organism or eliminated through the process of senescence, where older leaves or parts of the plant die off and are shed. Lastly, graptolites are an extinct group of colonial animals that were primarily marine and lived during the Paleozoic era. Although their exact physiology is not fully understood, they were likely more similar to modern-day hydrozoans and would have possessed some form of excretory systems suited for their needs. In conclusion, given the information provided, starfish are the best answer choice for organisms that lack respiratory and excretory systems among the options given. Their unique water vascular system serves the dual purpose of facilitating gas exchange, waste removal, and locomotion in lieu of specialized respiratory and excretory organs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(EW.com ) -- Back in 1977, Ron Howard made his directorial debut with a low-budget, high-octane car-crash comedy called \\"Grand Theft Auto.\\"  As first impressions go, it did not signal the second coming of Orson Welles. But the freckle-faced former \\"Happy Days\\" star radiated an infectious delight in smashing as many roaring muscle cars as he could get away with.  Since then, of course, Howard has become one of Hollywood's most consistent and respected filmmakers, crafting well-made crowd-pleasers that tackle more highbrow subjects. But judging from his white-knuckle new film, \\"Rush,\\" he hasn't outgrown his youthful sweet tooth for four-wheeled mayhem. He still has hot rods and the death-defying men who drive them on his mind.  Based on the real-life rivalry between Formula One racing legends James Hunt and Niki Lauda, \\"Rush\\" is a tale of two opposite personalities eyeing the same checkered-flag goal: winning the 1976 world championship. Chris Hemsworth draws the flashier role in Hunt, a fast-burning British bad boy with flowing blond locks, silk shirts unbuttoned to his navel, and a rakish playboy swagger.  On and off the track, he's wild, cocky, and undisciplined — a deadly combination when you're strapped into a coffin on wheels going 170 miles an hour. ''The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel,'' Hemsworth's Hunt says. And it's thanks to the \\"Thor\\" star's champagne-spraying charisma that he makes risking your neck look like the coolest job on the planet.  As Lauda, \\"Inglourious Basterds'\\" Daniel Brühl buries his boyish good looks behind ratlike prosthetic teeth. With his clipped Austrian accent, everything that comes out of his mouth sounds like a brusque insult. And it usually is. He may not be a particularly likable fellow, but he's a methodical grinder with the unshakable conviction of someone who's calculated the odds on what it takes to win. Pitted against each other, they're like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. It's not just about beating the other guy, it's about humiliating him in the process.  1. Was he calm? 2.

What is the answer to this question? in what year was the fall of jerusalem to the romans and destruction of the second temple?","output":"The fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Second Temple occurred in the year 70 CE (Common Era). This catastrophic event was the culmination of a series of conflicts between the Romans and the Jews living in the province of Judea. To provide a comprehensive understanding of this event, it's important to delve into the historical context and the factors that led to this tragedy. The Second Temple was an essential religious and cultural hub for the Jewish people. It was built on Jerusalem's Temple Mount in 516 BCE after the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon. The temple was later renovated and expanded by King Herod the Great around 20 BCE, making it a monumental architectural wonder. The Roman Empire ruled over a vast area, including the province of Judea. In the first century CE, various Jewish factions, including the Pharisees, Sadducees, Zealots, and Essenes, had distinct views on their relationship with the Roman authorities. Tensions between the Jews and the Romans continued to escalate as the Jews struggled for religious and political autonomy. In 66 CE, the Great Jewish Revolt broke out after the Romans plundered the Second Temple's treasury and murdered several Jewish leaders. This conflict marked the beginning of the First Jewish-Roman War, which lasted until 73 CE. The Zealots and other Jewish rebel factions fought against the Roman forces, led initially by Cestius Gallus and later by Vespasian and his son Titus. The Roman forces, known for their tactical prowess, had managed to suppress the Jewish rebellion in other parts of Judea before laying siege to Jerusalem in April 70 CE. The Roman legions led by Titus surrounded the city, cutting off food and water supplies, leading to desperate conditions within the city walls. The fall of Jerusalem occurred on the 10th of August (Tisha B'Av). After weeks of siege, the Romans breached the city walls, proceeded to sack the city, and put the remaining defenders to the sword. The Second Temple, considered the holiest site in Judaism, was destroyed in the process, a severe blow to the Jewish people's religious and cultural identity. The aftermath of this calamity included the enslavement and mass displacement of a significant portion of the Jewish population, along with the establishment of the Fiscus Judaicus, a tax system imposed on the Jews, both in Judea and across the Roman Empire. Jerusalem's fall and the Second Temple's destruction in 70 CE, as well as the subsequent Jewish diaspora, remain pivotal moments in Jewish history. These events not only shaped the course of Judaism but also influenced the development and spread of Christianity. The memory of the Second Temple's destruction continues to be commemorated annually during the Jewish fast of Tisha B'Av."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The mild-mannered Harold Diddlebock is promptly hired by the pompous advertising tycoon J.E. Waggleberry (Raymond Walburn) to work at his firm. Harold is given a low-paying job at the firm's bookeeper.Jumping forward 22 years to 1945, Harold (still working in his boring job as bookkeeper) is promptly let go by Waggleberry with nothing but a tiny pension of around 1,000.

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken.

Article: Alexander Litvinenko’s accusation that Vladimir Putin was a paedophile may have been one of the motives for the Russian government to order his assassination, a report into the former Russian spy's death has found.      Sir Robert Owen’s inquiry looked at the former FSB agent’s “highly personal attacks” on the Russian President, which culminated with an article on the Chechenpress website in July 2006, four months before he was poisoned.      Mr Litvinenko’s article, which was published as evidence in the report, started by recounting a meeting between Mr Putin and a boy “aged four or five” in a square near the Kremlin.      Litvinenko widow's statement      “Putin kneeled, lifted the boy’s T-shirt and kissed his stomach,” Mr Litvinenko wrote.      “Nobody can understand why the Russian president did such a strange thing as kissing the stomach of an unfamiliar small boy.”      The former FSB agent claimed there were “blank spots” in Mr Putin’s career that could be explained by his superiors’ alleged knowledge “that he was a paedophile”.      Mr Litvinenko claimed the Russian President had himself found “videotapes in the FSB Internal Security directorate, which showed him making sex with some underage boys” that he then hid.      Alexander Litvinenko pictured at the Intensive Care Unit of University College Hospital on November 20, 2006 in London      Commenting on the extraordinary and unfounded allegations, Sir Robert wrote: “It hardly needs saying that the allegations made by Mr Litvinenko against President Putin in this article were of the most serious nature. Could they have had any connection with his death?”      The judge’s 300-page report concludes that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun poisoned the 43-year-old with radioactive polonium 210 at a Mayfair hotel in 2006.      It found that there is a “strong probability” that the Russian secret service directed the killing, and that operation was “probably approved” by Mr Putin.

(Associated Press)      In a lengthy report, Judge Robert Owen said that he is certain Litvinenko was given tea with a fatal dose of polonium-210, a radioactive isotope that is deadly if ingested even in tiny quantities, in November 2006.      He said there is a \\"strong probability\\" that the FSB, successor to the Soviet spy agency the KGB, directed the killing, and the operation was \\"probably approved\\" by Putin.      Before he died, Litvinenko accused Putin of ordering his killing, but this appears to be the first time anyone has officially linked Putin to it.      Moscow has always strongly denied involvement in Litvinenko's death, and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zhakarova said Thursday that the government does not consider Owen's conclusions to be objective or impartial.      \\"We regret that a purely criminal case has been politicized and has darkened the general atmosphere of bilateral relations,\\" Zhakarova said in a statement. She said Britain's decision to hold a public inquiry on the case was politically motivated and that the process was not transparent for the Russian side or the public.      Russia has refused to extradite the two main suspects, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun.      Lugovoi is a member of the Russian parliament, which means he is immune from prosecution. In an interview with the Interfax news agency, he called the charges against him \\"absurd.\\"      \\"As we expected, there was no sensation,\\" he said. \\"The results of the investigation that were announced today once again confirm London's anti-Russian position and the blinkered view and unwillingness of the British to establish the true cause of Litvinenko's death.\\"      Litvinenko, a former FSB agent, fled to Britain in 2000 and became a vocal critic of Russia's security service and of Putin, whom he accused of links to organized crime.      Owen said Litvinenko \\"was regarded as having betrayed the FSB\\" with his actions, and that \\"there were powerful motives for organizations and individuals within the Russian state to take action against Mr. Litvinenko, including killing him.\\"      Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said outside the High Court on Thursday that she was \\"very pleased that the words my husband spoke on his deathbed when he accused Mr. Putin have been proved by an English court.\\"      She called for British Prime Minister David Cameron to take urgent steps against Russian agents operating inside Britain in light of the report.      \\"I'm calling immediately for expulsion from the UK of all Russian intelligence operatives ... based at the London embassy,\\" she said. \\"I'm also calling for the imposition of targeted economic sanctions and travel bans against named individuals including Mr (former FSB chief Nikolai) Patrushev and Mr Putin.\\"      She said Britain's Home Office had written to her Wednesday night promising action.      Home Secretary Theresa May is scheduled to discuss the report in Parliament later Thursday.      In his 326-page report, Owen said that based on the evidence he had seen, the operation to kill Litvinenko was \\"probably\\" approved by then-FSB head Nikolai Patrushev, now head of Putin's security council, and by Putin.      Owen said Litvinenko \\"had repeatedly targeted President Putin\\" with \\"highly personal\\" public criticism.      The British government appointed Owen to head a public inquiry into the slaying, which soured relations between London and Moscow. He heard from dozens of witnesses during months of public hearings last year, and also saw secret British intelligence evidence.      Announcing his findings at London's Royal Courts of Justice, Owen said that \\"there can be no doubt that Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by Mr. Lugovoi and Mr. Kovtun\\" in the Pine Bar of London's luxury Millennium Hotel on Nov. 1, 2006. He died three weeks later of acute radiation syndrome.      \\"I have concluded that there is a strong probability that when Mr. Lugovoi poisoned Mr. Litvinenko, he did so under the direction of the FSB ... I have further concluded that the FSB operation to kill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by My. Patrushev, then head of the FSB, and also by President Putin.\\" ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why would Vladimir Putin want Alexander Litvinenko dead?      The murder of ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 in the UK was \\"probably\\" approved by President Vladimir Putin, an inquiry has found.      Mr Putin is likely to have signed off the poisoning of Mr Litvinenko with polonium-210 in part due to personal \\"antagonism\\" between the pair, it said.      Home Secretary Theresa May said the murder was a \\"blatant and unacceptable\\" breach of international law.      But the Russian Foreign Ministry said the public inquiry was \\"politicised\\".      It said: \\"We regret that the purely criminal case was politicised and overshadowed the general atmosphere of bilateral relations.\\"      What Litvinenko report means for UK      Key findings of the public inquiry      Who was Alexander Litvinenko?      Who are the Litvinenko murder suspects?      Story of a perplexing murder      Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin's spokesman, said Moscow's official response to the report will happen through \\"diplomatic channels\\", the Russian news agency Interfax was quoted as saying.      Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK would have to go on having \\"some sort of relationship with them [Russia]\\" because of the Syria crisis, but it would be done with \\"clear eyes and a very cold heart\\".      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron said the murder of Alexander Litvinenko had been shown to be \\"state-sponsored\\"      The long-awaited report into Mr Litvinenko's death found that two Russian men - Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun - deliberately poisoned the 43-year-old in London in 2006 by putting the radioactive substance polonium-210 into his drink at a hotel.      Sir Robert Owen, the public inquiry chairman, said he was \\"sure\\" Mr Litvinenko's murder had been carried out by the two men and that they were probably acting under the direction of Moscow's FSB intelligence service, and approved by the organisation's chief, Nikolai Patrushev, as well as the Russian president.      He said Mr Litvinenko's work for British intelligence agencies, his criticism of the FSB and Mr Putin, and his association with other Russian dissidents were possible motives for his killing.      'Send a message'      There was also \\"undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism\\" between Mr Putin and Mr Litvinenko, he said.      The use of polonium-210 was \\"at the very least a strong indicator of state involvement\\" as it had to be made in a nuclear reactor, the report said.      The inquiry heard evidence that Mr Litvinenko may have been consigned to a slow death from radiation to \\"send a message\\".      What is polonium-210?      Image caption The teapot where traces of polonium-210 were discovered      Giving a statement to the House of Commons, Mrs May said Mr Cameron would raise the findings with President Putin at \\"the next available opportunity\\".      She said the UK would impose asset freezes on Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun and that international arrest warrants for the pair remained in place. They both deny killing Mr Litvinenko.      Both men are wanted in the UK for questioning, but Russia has refused to extradite them.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Marina Litvinenko: 'Russian spies must be expelled from UK'      Speaking earlier outside the High Court, Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said she was \\"very happy\\" that \\"the words my husband spoke on his deathbed when he accused Mr Putin have been proved by an English court\\".      She urged the UK government to expel all Russian intelligence operatives, impose economic sanctions on Moscow and impose a travel ban on Mr Putin.      The view from Moscow      Image copyright AP Image caption Andrei Lugovoi, left, and Dmitry Kovtun pictured in Moscow, in 2007      By the BBC's Oleg Boldyrev      For years Moscow rejected allegations of high-level involvement in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko.      The fact President Putin himself is now associated with this assassination has not changed anything.      Taking their lead from Robert Owen's use of the words \\"high probability\\", the second tier of the Russian establishment, mainly Kremlin-loyalist MPs, are dismissing the entire report as a politically-based fabrication.      Russians on social media are making fun of its conclusions by using the hashtag \\"PutinPossiblyApproved\\" in Russian - that is #ПутинВозможноОдобрил - to include all manner of crimes.      One Russian MP, Nikolai Kovalev, himself an ex-FSB boss, pointed out relations between Moscow and London would not be harmed by the report as there was no room for making them any worse.      How Russian media reported the Litvinenko inquiry      Responding to the report, Mr Lugovoi, who is now a politician in Russia, said the accusations against him were \\"absurd\\", the Russian news agency Interfax was quoted as saying.      \\"As we expected, there were no surprises,\\" he said.      \\"The results of the investigation made public today yet again confirm London's anti-Russian position, its blinkeredness and the unwillingness of the English to establish the true reason of Litvinenko's death.\\"      Mr Kovtun, now a businessman in Russia, said he would not comment on the report until he got more information about its contents, Interfax reported.      'Harm relations'      London's Metropolitan Police said the investigation into the \\"cold and calculated murder\\" remained ongoing.      Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador in the UK, said Russia would not accept any decisions reached in secret and based on evidence not tested in open court.      The length of time taken to come to these conclusions led them to believe it was \\"a whitewash of British security services' incompetence\\", he said.      Mr Yakovenko said these events \\"can't help but harm our bilateral relations\\".      White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he did not have \\"any actions\\" to announce following the inquiry's findings. \\"But I certainly wouldn't rule out future steps,\\" he said.      Analysis      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Alexander Litvinenko at a news conference in Moscow in 1998, when he was an officer of Russia's state security service FSB      By BBC security correspondent, Gordon Corera      The conclusions of this inquiry are stronger than many expected in pointing the finger at Vladimir Putin personally.      The evidence behind that seems to have come from secret intelligence heard in closed session.      Saying that Alexander Litvinenko was killed because he was an enemy of the Russian state will raise pressure on the British government to take real action - the steps taken nearly a decade ago were only limited in scope.      That may pose difficulties given the importance of Russia's role in the Middle East, but without tough action people may ask if the Russian government has been allowed to get away with what has been described as an act of nuclear terrorism on the streets of London.      Mr Litvinenko fled to the UK in 2000, claiming persecution. He was granted asylum and gained British citizenship several years later.      In the years before his death, he worked as a writer and journalist, becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin \\"probably\\" approved the killing, the report says      It is believed he also worked as a consultant for MI6, specialising in Russian organised crime.

The project was born from the idea of the \\"Slow Food\\" movement -- started in Italy in the 1980s -- which promotes leisurely eating and the growing of local, healthy products to fight against the American fast-food style. \\"The American urban model has invaded our cities, making Italian towns look the same. We want to stop this kind of globalization,\\" says Paolo Saturnini, an Italian mayor. The \\"Slow City\\" project plans to emphasize the rich, cultural, culinary  and artistic local traditions of each community. Walking areas will be enlarged and squares and parks will be made greener with more plants. Car alarms and other noise that disturbs the peace will be banned, and ugly TV aerials , advertising posters, and signs will be taken down. City councils will also insist on the use of recycling and renewable energy sources, and will also introduce ecological transport systems. Parking will be made stress-free by creating more public parking areas, and easily accessible walkways and bike lanes will cross the city. But in the \\"Slow City\\" way, all improvements will probably come about slowly. Thirty-two Italian city councils, which joined the \\"Slow City\\" program, have decided to take further steps in this direction by increasing the numbers of traditional family-style eating establishments, reducing noise pollution, and concentrating on making their towns friendlier for people to live in. Organic local produce will be promoted in all restaurants and genetically modified foods  will be banned. \\"We can't stop large, fast-food chains from coming here, but we hope that people who come to our towns will not want to eat exactly the same hamburger they can eat in Melbourne, London or Paris, but want something genuine and different,\\" said Saturnini.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose \\"romantically classical\\" approach was commented on by reviewers? ?  Bellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II. Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of \\"the impulsiveness of romanticism...

On the day of the relay officials diverted the torch run to an unannounced route. The start was at McCovey Cove, where Norman Bellingham of the U.S. Olympic Committee gave the torch to the first torchbearer, Chinese 1992 Olympic champion swimmer Lin Li. The planned closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza was cancelled and instead, a ceremony was held at San Francisco International Airport, where the torch was to leave for Buenos Aires. The route changes allowed the run to avoid large numbers of China supporters and protesters against China. As people found out there would be no closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza, there were angry reactions. One demonstrator was quoted as saying that the route changes were an effort to \\"thwart any organized protest that had been planned.\\" San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a critic of Mayor Gavin Newsom, said that it was a \\"cynical plan to please the Bush State Department and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of money.\\" Newsom, on the other hand, said he felt it was in \\"everyone's best interest\\" and that he believed people had been \\"afforded the right to protest and support the torch\\" despite the route changes. Peter Ueberroth, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, praised the route changes, saying, \\"The city of San Francisco, from a global perspective, will be applauded.\\" People who saw the torch were surprised and cheered as shown from live video of CBS and NBC. The cost to the city for hosting the event was reported to be USD 726,400, nearly half of which has been recovered by private fundraising. Mayor Gavin Newsom said that \\"exponential\\" costs associated with mass arrests were avoided by his decision to change the route in consultation with police chief Heather Fong.

Wind-up type alarm clocks with bells, clock radios, and even many cell phones and pagers can be set to play an alert that can wake even the deepest sleepers.  Choose alarm type.","output":"When selecting the alarm type, consider the following options to ensure that it best suits your personal preferences and sleep habits: 1. Sound options: Traditional alarm clocks often make use of a loud, jarring buzzer or bell sound that can be effective in waking you up from a deep slumber. Digital alarm clocks and smartphones, on the other hand, offer a wider variety of sounds, such as beeps, songs, nature sounds, and even your favorite tunes. In addition, some devices allow you to adjust the volume and gradually increase the noise level, ensuring a more gentle wake-up experience. 2. Vibration: For individuals who are heavy sleepers, a vibrating alarm clock may be the ideal choice. These alarms create a physical sensation instead of relying on noise that can be felt even when the volume is low. Using a vibrating wristband or placing the alarm under your pillow can be effective methods to wake up without disturbing a sleeping partner. 3. Light-based alarms: Light-based alarm clocks simulate the rising sun by gradually increasing the brightness in the room, providing a natural way to wake up that doesn't rely on startling noises. These devices can be especially helpful for individuals who suffer from seasonal affective disorder, since they mimic the effect of a sunrise and provide an energizing start to the day. 4. Sleep cycle alarms: Some alarm clocks are designed to work in conjunction with sleep analysis apps or devices that monitor your sleep cycle. These alarms aim to wake you up during a lighter stage of sleep, leading to a less groggy wake-up experience. By tracking your sleep patterns and movements, these clocks can help reduce the likelihood of interrupting a deep sleep, making it easier to rise and feel refreshed. 5. Dual alarms: For those who need an extra boost to get out of bed, using a dual alarm system that combines both sound and vibration can be an effective wake-up strategy. This approach may also be useful for couples with different schedules, as one partner may require a louder alarm than the other. 6. Snooze button: While some individuals may benefit from a snooze function, enabling them to gradually wake up over a period of time, others may find that hitting snooze repeatedly leads to oversleeping and reduced productivity. In this instance, consider finding an alarm without a snooze button or pursuing additional strategies to help resist the temptation to snooze. Once you have chosen your preferred alarm type, be sure to test it out for several mornings to ensure its effectiveness. Modify the settings as needed to create the most optimal wake-up experience, accounting for factors such as volume, vibration intensity, and light brightness. Consistently waking up with an alarm clock may take some time to adjust to, but with persistence and a suitable device, you can train yourself to rise on time and optimize your daily routine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll.

Both sentences start with \\"The bulk\\" - the main part or majority. 2. The first sentence mentions a specific amount is \\"some 65 billion.\\" The second sentence provides a slightly different figure, \\"64.7 billion.\\" 3. Both sentences allocate these funds \\"for military operations.\\" 4. The countries mentioned are \\"Iraq and Afghanistan\\" in both cases. 5. Sentence 1 indicates that the funds \\"will go\\" or are designated for these military operations. Sentence 2 says \\"goes,\\" but the meaning remains the same. The main difference between these sentences is the amount stated: \\"some 65 billion\\" vs \\"64.7 billion.\\" However, the general meaning of the sentences remains the same: The majority of the funds are designated for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The difference in exact amounts doesn't substantially change the overall meaning. They both convey that a large sum of money will be used to fund those military operations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Combine those terms together: 0 = (25o - 15o - 8o) - 8 The terms in the parentheses involve 'o'. Combine them: 0 = 2o - 8 Step 2: Isolate the variable (o) The goal is to get 'o' alone on one side of the equation. To do this, add 8 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 8 = 2o - 8 + 8 0 + 8 = 2o 8 = 2o Step 3: Solve for 'o' To get the value for 'o', divide both sides by 2: 8 / 2 = 2o / 2 4 = o So the solution is o = 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After having seen and loved Postal (yes, I actually loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll film and I picked out Seed because I happened to stumble on it in a local DVD-store and it's supposed to be one of his better films. While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films I've seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-par acting. It seems like Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it. Maybe he should stick to comedy?! The few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch, which ruined my experience altogether. There are a very fairly well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. And let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times. I hope Uwe Boll will one day learn what makes a good film, because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then. Seed just isn't one of those.

Choose your answer from: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;...I think the answer is","output":"c). no; The reason for this conclusion is that the two statements provided do not seem to have any apparent connection or correlation between them. They describe two distinct scenarios involving different subjects and contexts. Let's analyze both statements separately for better understanding: Statement 1: \\"An adorable little boy plays in the dirt while lying on a brick divider.\\" This statement tells us that there is a young boy, presumably of a tender age, engaged in some activity in the dirt. He is lying on a brick divider, which could indicate that the setting is an urban area, perhaps a park or a playground. The brick divider could be a structural element separating different sections of the play area or the park. The focus of the statement is on the playful actions of the young child. Statement 2: \\"An old woman lays on the dirt road.\\" This statement introduces a completely different scenario. The subject is an elderly woman who is lying on a dirt road. The use of the term \\"dirt road\\" implies that the setting could be more rural or undeveloped, which contrasts with the brick divider in the first statement. Additionally, the woman's action - laying down - does not suggest that she is engaged in any activity similar to the boy in the first statement. Given the disparity in the subjects, settings, and actions described in the two statements, it is clear that we cannot draw a conclusion that links the situations in any meaningful manner.

Given the question: This article: Long ago, a young Plains warrior is tested by being the target of three different weapons.  Centuries later, Ernest P. Worrell works as a maintenance man at Kamp Kikakee but hopes to become a counselor. He quickly becomes a valuable addition to the staff, skilled at Plains Indian Sign Language, used by Kikakee's owner, Chief St. Cloud.  A small group of juvenile delinquents, the Second Chancers, come to Kikakee. Head Counselor Tipton assigns Kikakee's most experienced counselor, Ross Stennis, to be the boys' counselor. Stennis is unhappy with this assignment, and he treats the boys harshly. After he goes too far by intentionally causing Moustafa Jones, the smallest boy in the group, to nearly drown in the lake during swimming, only for Moustafa to be rescued by Ernest, the boys retaliate against Stennis's cruelty by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, badly injuring Stennis's leg in the process. Since Stennis is no longer able to perform his duties as a counselor and Kikakee is already shorthanded, Tipton offers Stennis's position to Ernest. The Second Chancers initially give Ernest trouble, but they start to show respect during a campfire session when Nurse St. Cloud translates her grandfather's description of the warrior initiation ritual for his tribe. The initiate must hold still while a knife, a stone hatchet, and an arrow are thrown or shot at him. The courage of the young warrior apparently alters the course of each weapon to prevent it from striking him. The Second Chancers build a tepee only to find it burned.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

Summarize this article: They've discovered a new way in which warming increases levels of the toxin in sea creatures. In experiments, they found that extra rainfall drives up the amount of organic material flowing into the seas. This alters the food chain, adding another layer of complex organisms which boosts the concentrations of mercury up the line. The study has been published in the journal, Science Advances. Mercury is one of the world's most toxic metals, and according to the World Health Organization, is one of the top ten threats to public health. The substance at high levels has been linked to damage to the nervous system, paralysis and mental impairment in children. The most common form of exposure to mercury is by eating fish containing methylmercury, an organic form of the chemical which forms when bacteria react with mercury in water, soil or plants. Levels of mercury in the world's ecosystems have increased by between 200 and 500%, since the industrial revolution say experts, driven up by the use of fossil fuels such as coal. In recent years there are have been concentrated efforts to limit the amount of mercury entering the environment, with an international treaty, called the Minamata Convention, signed by 136 countries in place since 2013. But this new study suggests that climate change could be driving up levels of methylmercury in a manner not previously recognised. In a large laboratory, Swedish researchers recreated the conditions found in the Bothnian sea estuary. They discovered that as temperatures increase, there is an increased run-off of organic matter into the world's oceans and lakes. This encourages the growth of bacteria at the expense of phytoplankton. \\"When bacteria become abundant in the water there is also a growth of a new type of predators that feed on bacteria,\\" lead author Dr Erik Bjorn from Umea University in Sweden told BBC News. \\"You basically get one extra step in the food chain and methylmercury is enriched by about a factor of ten in each such step in the food web.\\" Under the warmest climate scenario suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there would be an increase in organic matter run-off of 15-20% by the end of this century. This in turn would see levels of methylmercury in zooplankton, the bottom link in the food chain, grow by between two and seven fold. Different parts of the world will suffer different impacts say the researchers, with lakes and coastal waters in the northern hemisphere being the most likely to have significant increases in methylmercury levels in fish, while the Mediterranean, the central US and Southern Africa will likely see reductions. Researchers hope that the Minamata treaty will be successful and countries reduce the amount of mercury that is being produced. Otherwise this discovery of a previously unknown source could have impacts for human health. \\"If we reduce mercury emissions, then we need to know how fast will ecosystems recover,\\" said Dr Bjorn. \\"If we don't do anything and mercury doesn't decrease, and we add this on top then the implications would be severe.\\" Other researchers in the field say that the new study highlights important issues that have previously been little known. \\"This work experimentally proves that climate change will have a significant effect of methylmercury budgets in coastal waters and its concentrations in fish,\\" said Milena Horvat from the Jozef Stefan Institute in Slovenia. \\"This work will also have an important impact on future scenario simulations on the presence of mercury in fish in response to global mercury reductions from emission sources (primarily industrial).\\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook","output":"A new study published in Science Advances has found that climate change may increase the levels of mercury in sea creatures. Rising temperatures lead to increased rainfall, which results in more organic material flowing into the seas. This alters the food chain, creating an additional layer of complex organisms and boosting mercury concentrations. Mercury is one of the most toxic metals and a major threat to public health. Levels of mercury in global ecosystems have increased between 200-500% since the industrial revolution. The researchers found that increased run-off of organic matter into oceans encourages bacterial growth at the expense of phytoplankton, leading to higher levels of enriched methylmercury in the food chain."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football, it is much slower-paced than the more hectic rugby league, in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play. Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league; defending players interfering with any other attacking player (and vice versa) will incur a penalty. Passing in the two sports also differs: while backward passing is common to both sports, in American football players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal. Rugby league players have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield. To score a try or touchdown in rugby league, the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone, whereas in American football the player has to simply cross the line. American football also requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment, including helmets, gloves and padding around the body, whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league, usually amounting to light padding (if any) and soft head gear (hard helmets being illegal). The rugby pitch and American football field are both similar in size with a pitch being 100 meters while a football field is 100 yards. Is it true that is american football and rugby the same thing?","output":"No, my little friend, American football and rugby are not the same thing. They may look similar because both games have players running with a ball, but there are some important differences between the two sports. Here are a few: 1. In American football, players can throw the ball forward to their teammates, but in rugby, players can only pass the ball backward or sideways. 2. American football has more protective gear like helmets and shoulder pads, while rugby players usually wear less padding and no hard helmets. 3. American football has many stops and starts, making it a slower-paced game. In rugby, the game flows more and doesn't stop as often, so it's faster and more hectic. 4. In rugby, all players can run with the ball, pass, and tackle. In American football, players have specific positions and jobs on the field, like a quarterback who throws the ball or a lineman who blocks and tackles. So, nope, they are not the same. American football and rugby are two different sports with their own unique rules, strategies, and styles of play."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It originated in the United Kingdom, and is celebrated in a number of countries that previously formed part of the British Empire. Boxing Day is on 26 December, although the attached bank holiday or public holiday may take place either on that day or two days later. What's the best answer to this question: is boxing day a national holiday in canada?","output":"Yes, Boxing Day is a national holiday in Canada, which means it is widely recognized and celebrated in the country. As a former British colony, Canada has inherited many traditions and customs from the United Kingdom, including the observance of Boxing Day on December 26th. The name \\"Boxing Day\\" is thought to have originated from the tradition of giving Christmas boxes, which were gifts or monetary bonuses, to service workers such as postal workers, servants, and tradespeople during the holiday season. Boxing Day is observed as a public holiday in most provinces and territories in Canada. It is usually a day off work for employees, although this depends on local employment laws and individual contracts, as some provinces do not officially observe it as a statutory holiday. In provinces where Boxing Day is not a statutory holiday, employers may still choose to give their employees this day off or offer extra pay for working on this day. Traditionally, Boxing Day in Canada is a day for shopping, with stores offering post-Christmas discounts and sales, similar to Black Friday in the United States. People often engage in return and exchange of Christmas gifts on this day, and many retailers see high traffic and sales volume on Boxing Day. While the shopping aspect remains a significant part of Boxing Day, the holiday has evolved over time. Canadians often use this day to spend more time relaxing with friends and family, attending social events, or participating in outdoor activities such as skiing, ice-skating, or ice hockey. Moreover, some people use this day to support charitable events or give donations to those in need. In summary, although each province may have its own laws regarding the observance of Boxing Day, it is indeed considered a national holiday in Canada. Canadians, particularly those in the provinces where it is a statutory holiday, enjoy a day off work and often take advantage of the sales or engage in leisure activities with friends and family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Backowski's body was found on Sunday morning.      A snowboarder was found dead on Sunday after he was buried by snow and ice on a mountain in Oregon, police and family said.      Collin Backowski’s body was found buried under 8 to 10 feet of snow and ice on Mount Hood on Sunday morning, said Lieutenant Tiffany Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Hood River Country Sheriff’s office.      Backowski was reported missing on Saturday afternoon, Peterson said. The 25-year old Colorado man had been snowboarding with five friends from the children’s snowboarding camp he worked at when he broke off from the group and boarded under an ice cave, his father, John Backowski said.      “He was very good at helping other people with [snowboarding],” said John Backowski.      “It never worried me what he was doing late at night. It worried me to death what he was doing when he died,” said Backowski.      “He was doing what he loved.”      Backowski said his son had sent him a photo from the fatal trip and said, “I wouldn’t go where he was when he took that picture.\\"      Peterson said that \\"12 personnel used chainsaws and other hand tools\\" to remove \\"several tons of debris\\" from the trapped snowboarder's body.      “He chose to live out there on the edge with the snowboarding and I obviously wanted more from him,” Backowski said, but added, “I would never try to take it away from him. He loved it.” |||||             A search team recovered the body of missing snowboarder Collin Backowski Sunday morning from Mount Hood.      At 4 a.m. Sunday, 12 members of two rescue organizations , the Hood River County Crag Rats and Portland Mountain Rescue, returned to the fallen ice tunnel that trapped Backowski, 25, of Pines, Colo., on Saturday.      They used chain saws and hand tools to cut through tons of ice and reach his body about 8:45 a.m.      Backowski's family was notified. His body was transferred to Anderson's Tribute Center of Hood River.      Rescuers had expected that Backowski might not survive the tunnel collapse that buried him under a huge piece of ice, said Sgt. Pete Hughes, a spokesman for the Hood River County Sheriff's Office.      The incident occurred at the 8100-foot level of Mt. Hood on the White River Glacier in Hood River County. The Clackamas County Sheriff's Office and other agencies assisted in the response.      Backowski, 25, and five other men in their twenties were looking for a place to snowboard Saturday on Mt. Hood's south slopes when they entered a tunnel formed by melting snow. The tunnel collapsed, trapping Backowski under a piece of ice described as the size of a school bus.      Two of the other men were hit by debris but not injured. They were not identified, but the group ranged in age from 24 to 29.

Hood River County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Tiffany Peterson said a rescue crew found the body of Collin Backowski, 25, under 8 to 10 feet of snow and ice Sunday morning, KATU reported.      Backowski, of Pines, Colo., had been missing since an ice tunnel collapsed Saturday afternoon. Five of his companions, all in their 20s, were uninjured and called for help. They tried to dig Backowski out, but weren't able to break through the thick snow and ice.      A dozen people had been using chainsaws and other tools to clear snow and ice since early Sunday morning.      Backowski and his friends had been scouting for places to take videos and pictures on the White River Glacier, which begins about 6,000 feet up the south side of the mountain, KGW TV reported. Around 4 p.m. Saturday, a large piece of ice — about the size of a school bus — came crashing down when Backowski was about 30 to 40 feet ahead of the rest of the group.      \\"Two days ago I went and scouted a crevasse to jump over,\\" Grant Giller, one of Backowski's companions on the mountain, told KATU. \\"One of the kids up there is a professional snowboarder like myself. Two of the guys up there I know are photographers. So we were just going to take some photos.\\"      Collin Backowski's father, John Backowski, told NBC News that his son died doing what he loved: snowboarding.      \\"He chose to live out there on the edge with the snowboarding,\\" Backowski said. \\"I would never try to take it away from him. He loved it.\\"      Contributing: The Associated Press ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A 25-year-old snowboarder, Collin Backowski, was found dead on Mount Hood in Oregon after an ice tunnel collapsed, burying him under 8 to 10 feet of snow and ice.

Twelve rescue personnel from the Hood River County Crag Rats and Portland Mountain Rescue used chainsaws and hand tools to cut through tons of ice and debris to recover Backowski's body.

Question: Where Omar misfired his rocket? Title: Four Lions Movie plot: A group of radicalised young British Muslim men aspire to be suicide bombers. They are Omar (Riz Ahmed), who is deeply critical of Western society and imperialism; his dim-witted friend, Waj (Kayvan Novak); Barry (Nigel Lindsay), a bad-tempered and extremely rash white convert to Islam; and the naive Faisal (Adeel Akhtar), who tries to train crows to be used as bombers. While Omar and Waj go to a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, Barry recruits a reluctant fifth member, Hassan (Arsher Ali). The visit to the training camp ends in disaster, with Omar misfiring a rocket backwards that kills fellow jihadists; however, he uses the experience to assert authority on his return to Britain. The group begins acquiring materials for making improvised explosive devices but disagree about what to target. Barry wants to bomb a local mosque as a false flag operation to \\"radicalise the moderates\\", but Omar considers this idiotic. Faisal suggests blowing up a branch of the pharmacy chain Boots, but Omar states it is a not a worthwhile target. Hassan allows an oblivious neighbour (Julia Davis) into their safe house; the group think they have been compromised and transport their volatile explosives to a new location in grocery bags. Faisal accidentally trips in a field while carrying the explosives and blows up. This causes a row among the remaining four, who disband; but they reconcile, and Omar decides to target the upcoming London Marathon. Wearing mascot costumes to conceal their explosives, they prepare to attack. Waj expresses doubts about the rectitude of the plot, but Omar convinces him to go ahead. Hassan loses his nerve and tries to alert nearby police officers, but Barry detonates his bomb using a mobile phone, killing Hassan. This causes the police to search for the remaining three. Omar realises he has led an unwitting Waj into something he does not want to do and tries to change his mind.

It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.

Question: what kind of legal remedy is it to ask someone to fulfill there promise I found the following answer on Google: A contract is a legally enforceable promise or undertaking that something will or will not occur. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is correct but let me provide more information for a better understanding. A contract is indeed a legally enforceable promise or trading of commitments that something will or will not done. However, concerning a remedy, when someone does not fulfill their promise constituted in a contract, that's considered a breach of contract. In these situations, there are a number of potential legal remedies that can be pursued. 1. **Damages**: The most common remedy for a breach of contract is damages, or monetary compensation for the loss incurred due to breach of contract. This can be \\"compensatory\\" (for actual losses), \\"consequential\\" (for indirect losses), or \\"punitive\\" (a penalty). 2. **Specific Performance**: This is a court order requiring the breaching party to fulfill their original contractual obligations. This remedy is often applied when damages are insufficient to compensate the non-breaching party, or when the subject matter of the contract is unique. 3. **Rescission**: This remedy allows the non-breaching party to cancel the contract and be restored to the position they were in before the contract was made. 4. **Reformation**: This remedy allows for the contract to be rewritten to reflect the parties' actual intentions. It's typically used in cases where a mistake, fraud, or inequity has occurred. 5. **Restitution**: This remedy is employed to prevent unjust enrichment of one party at the cost of the other. So, when you ask someone to 'fulfill their promise', in legal terms, you might be seeking a specific performance, or a form of damages, depending upon the type of contract and the context. Legal advice should be sought in these circumstances to ensure the most suitable and beneficial route is taken."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hire a locksmith as a last resort.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Ensuring Home Security: Checking Unlocked Windows and Beyond Introduction Home security is a top concern for many, as it ensures the protection of both our loved ones and our prized possessions. Several layers of security can be put in place to prevent break-ins and other forms of unwanted access. Inadequate security measures leave homes vulnerable, making them prime targets for theft and vandalism. As such, it is important to consistently review and update these measures to ensure that potential weak points in home security are attended to. In this article, we will explore the importance of checking for unlocked windows, making necessary phone calls to roommates and landlords, and considering the help of a professional locksmith as a last resort. Section 1: Checking for Unlocked Windows One of the first steps in ensuring home security is to regularly check for unlocked windows. As windows are common entry points for burglars, it is essential that they remain closed and locked when not in use. Furthermore, it is best to make a habit of locking windows upon closing for peace of mind. To make this more manageable, consider developing a daily routine to inspect windows and guarantee their proper closure. In addition, it is crucial to inspect window locks to ascertain that they are functional and correctly positioned. Section 2: Communicate with Your Roommates In shared living situations, such as apartment complexes or student housing, maintaining effective communication with roommates is vital for home security. Inform roommates of the importance of checking for unlocked windows and establishing a mutually agreed-upon routine. By working together, roommates can ensure that all points of access to the living space are secure. In the event that a roommate forgets to lock a door or window and another is unable to reach the location, instructing them to call you as soon as possible can help prevent potential security breaches. Section 3: Reach Out to Your Landlord Landlords play an essential role in maintaining home security, as they are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the property. If you encounter any issues with locks, doors, or windows, do not hesitate to reach out to your landlord. When communicating with your landlord, be specific about the problem, and request prompt assistance in resolving the issue. Additionally, it is always wise to have a written record of your correspondence with your landlord in case any future disputes or misunderstandings arise. Section 4: Hire a Locksmith as a Last Resort While checking windows, communicating with roommates, and reaching out to landlords are effective measures to maintain home security, there may be instances where professional intervention is necessary. If you find yourself locked out of your home or if a lock is broken or malfunctioning, hiring a locksmith may be the recommended course of action. Locksmiths can provide valuable services, including lock repair, re-keying, and replacement. Make sure that you choose a reputable locksmith who has a history of providing quality service in your area. Furthermore, it may be worth keeping the contact information of a trusted locksmith on hand in case of emergencies.

Hartfield explains that the events about to be shown in the film is raw footage from the sixth and final episode filmed, edited only for time-restraint purposes.The footage shows the crew of Grave Encounters composed of Lance himself, occult specialist Sasha Parker, technical expert Matt White, cameraman T. C. Gibson, and guest starring psychic medium Houston Greypreparing to investigate the abandoned Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital where unexplained phenomena has been reported for years. They receive a tour of Collingwood and its underground tunnels from the hospital's caretaker. They also learn about Collingwood's history, including a physician named Arthur Friedkin, who performed unethical experiments and lobotomies on the patients at the hospital before being killed by escaped patients. The crew voluntarily lock themselves inside Collingwood for the night and begin their investigation, setting up camp near the hospital's main entrance, which is locked from the outside. No paranormal activity occurs for the first few hours until a door slams behind T. C. by itself while he is filming around the building. Lance and his crew try to establish contact with the unseen entities responsible, and are further tormented by more hauntings, which become increasingly blatant and hostile.With half an hour left before the hospital caretaker comes to unlock the front doors, the crew starts packing.

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon.

Here is a news article: A Texas Tech police officer has been shot and killed at Texas Tech Police Headquarters. It happened around 7:45 p.m. Monday at the Texas Tech Police building at 413 Flint Avenue.      Officials with the Lubbock Police Department say Texas Tech police made a student welfare check late Monday afternoon. When the officers entered the room of 19-year-old freshman Hollis A. Daniels, officers found evidence of drugs and drug paraphernalia. Officers took Daniels to the TTU police station for standard debriefing.      At the TTU police station, Daniels is accused of pulling a gun and fatally shooting an officer. The suspect ran off and a full SWAT call out was made.      \\"During this time, the suspect pulled a gun and mortally shot an officer,\\" Texas Tech Police Department Chief Kyle Bonath said. \\"The suspect fled on foot and later apprehended by TTPD near the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum.\\"      Daniels was taken into custody at 9:28 p.m. according to officials with the Lubbock County Sheriff's Office. He was found near the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum.      Sources say Daniels' ripped off the officer's body camera after the shooting, but the camera was found around 10:30 p.m.      Once Daniels was taken into custody, the lockdowns at Texas Tech University and University Medical Center were lifted. Classes will resume normally on Tuesday, Oct. 10, but officials say people still need to avoid the Texas Tech Police Department and the north side of campus.      Sources report after being taken into custody, Daniels repeatedly tried to spit on law enforcement officers.      Officials with Texas Tech Police, Lubbock Police Department, Lubbock County Sheriff's Office, Federal agents, and the Texas Department of Public Safety were all called to assist.      After Daniels' arrest, officials were searching through vehicles on the west side of the stadium. Sources say a gun was recovered, but it is not clear if it belonged to the officer or Daniels.      T.C. Richards, a TTU student, says he found out about the active shooter situation and noticed there were many students walking around, unaware of the situation. He decided to drive around and pick up students and take them to their dorms. He said he pulled over in the parking lot of the Jones AT&T Stadium to send a text to a friend about the shooting. He then noticed a man walking next to his vehicle who matched the description of the shooter.      \\"He walked out from behind the football stadium, between the football stadium and the training facility, started walking across the parking lot, in the same exact clothing he was wearing. He kept looking back at my truck. My headlights were on and he kind of walked pretty quick,\\" said Richards.      He said that is when he called 911. Within a few minutes, officers arrived at his location to ask him some questions. They asked him to leave the area. Richards said just a few moments later he received the alert the suspected shooter was in custody.      \\"They got the situation under control within the hour made me feel safe because I know they did their job properly and they did a really good job in general. So I feel much safer now knowing that our police officers here are taking care of us making sure we're safe,\\" said TTU student Bahij Atallah.      Atallah was at the Rec Center on campus when the shooting happened. He was texting Richards during the shooting. He said the staff escorted those in the Rec Center to the basement to make sure everyone was safe.      \\"The family of the officer is in the thoughts and prayers of the Texas Tech community,\\" Texas Tech President Lawrence Schovanec said. \\"I want to express my deep appreciation to the Texas Tech Police Department, Lubbock Police Department, Lubbock Sheriff’s Office, and other state and federal law enforcement officials for their response.\\"      Governor Greg Abbott issued the following statement on the shooting that occurred at Texas Tech University this evening:      \\"First and foremost, our hearts go out to the family of the police officer killed at Texas Tech University.

A major U.S. government study on rats has found a link between cellphones and cancer, an explosive finding in the long-running debate about whether mobile phones cause health effects.      The multiyear, peer-reviewed study, by the National Toxicology Program, found “low incidences” of two types of tumors in male rats that were exposed to the type of radio frequencies that are commonly emitted by cellphones. The tumors were gliomas, which are in the glial cells of the brain, and schwannomas of the heart.      ... ||||| A study by the Department of Health and Human Services's National Toxicology Program discovered a link between cellphone radiation and two types of cancer. Reporting on its partial results so far, researchers found low incidences of heart and brain tumors in male rats. (Reuters)      First things first: No one has proven that cellphones cause cancer. No one has proven that cellphones cause cancer. In fact, most research suggests otherwise! But you might not realize that, based on some news circulating Friday morning. Many publications, including the Wall Street Journal and Mother Jones, are trumpeting the results of a U.S. government study that links cellphones to tumor growth.      But while the WSJ ran with the scary \\"Cellphone-Cancer Link Found in Government Study,\\" something like \\"Research That Hasn't Been Vetted Yet Shows Possible Link Between Cellphones and Cancer in Male Rats\\" might have been more appropriate.      Less sexy! But also a lot less misleading.      The study, released on Thursday after the results leaked online, is the result of a 25 million, multi-year effort from the National Toxicology Program (NTP). But it hasn't been peer reviewed — despite implications to the contrary by the WSJ — because it hasn't been formally submitted to a scientific journal and accepted for publication, during which time outside experts would have had the opportunity to pinpoint possible errors or exaggerations in the data and analysis. Several experts reportedly reviewed the work before it was announced, but the researchers have not yet made all of their data public.      [Why it’s too early to get excited about this ‘unprecedented’ new cancer treatment]      Ron Melnick, who was the lead investigator on the study until he retired in 2009, told STAT News that he was asked to review the data and found that they “indicated that there were increased tumor responses in the brain and the heart.\\"      “Where people were saying there’s no risk, I think this ends that kind of statement,” he told the WSJ.      The researchers exposed mice and rats to radio-frequencies commonly used by wireless electronics, at doses comparable to a human's typical exposure. Of the male rats dosed with radiation, the study authors report, 2 to 3 percent contracted gliomas, or tumors of the glial cells of the brain, and 6 to 7 percent percent developed schwannoma tumors in their hearts. None of the non-dosed rats developed any tumors. But STAT points out that it's unusual that none of these non-dosed rats randomly developed tumors on their own, and that the cancer rates in the dosed rats might actually be pretty similar to what you'd usually expect in a random rat population.      [Addicted to your cellphone? These photos may make you uncomfortable.]      There was no significant cancer uptick in the female rats dosed with radiation, and the researchers have not released their data on male or female mice.      All of this is to say that it's way too soon to take these findings as a reason to toss your phone out the window. We've explained before that single studies are basically useless on their own (here's why) and that's still the case. This research will almost certainly inspire new projects that try to replicate the troubling results, and that's great. But when publications blast every contrarian new finding as a groundbreaking absolute truth, it makes the public less able to develop informed opinions.      \\"There are arguments in the literature now that we are at the beginning of an epidemic of cancers,\\" Chris Portier, former associate director of the NTP, told Mother Jones. \\"There are arguments against that. It is not clear who is right. I have looked through it. It's a mixed bag.\\"      Indeed, most studies examining the human population over time have concluded no association between cellphone use and increased rates of cancer. Some have argued that we just haven't been using cellphones long enough to see the ill-effects borne out, but the University of Sidney's Simon Chapman recently argued against this line of thinking.      \\"That is not what we see with cancer,\\" he wrote in an op-ed for Quartz. \\"We see gradual rises moving toward peak incidence, which can be as late as 30 to 40 years (as with lung cancer and smoking).\\" And his research — and that produced by other scientists — has failed to show the start of such a trend.      Maybe this study really is a major turning point in understanding of the risk of cell phone usage. But it's way too soon to tell.      Read More:      Got a question you think science can solve?

When researchers exposed rats to the radiofrequency radiation emitted by cellphones, they saw higher incidence of two types of cancer: malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas in the heart. The increased risk was relatively small, but if the findings translate to humans — still an unknown — it could have a large public health impact, given the widespread use of cellphones worldwide.      The highly anticipated, 25 million study was conducted by the US National Toxicology Program. Partial results were released late Thursday, before full results were available, because of intense public interest, according to John Bucher, associate director of the NTP.      advertisement      “We feel that these findings are potentially of interest to the discussion over the cellphone safety issues,” Bucher said. “We felt it was important to get the word out.”      However, “the results from our studies are far from definitive at this point,” he said. For human health, “this may have relevance. This may have no relevance.”      The study had some head-scratching findings. For instance, it found that despite developing more tumors, male rats exposed to radiation for about nine hours every day also lived longer than a control group not exposed to radiation. In addition, it was unusual that no cancers occurred in the control group in this study. The incidence of malignant gliomas in male rats exposed to radiation — 2.2 to 3.3 percent — was within the range seen in nonexposed rats in previous studies, the authors said.      Still, the authors said that the brain and heart tumors observed in rats exposed to the radiofrequency radiation are similar to malignancies seen in some epidemiological studies of cellphone use. They say their findings “appear to support” the World Health Organization’s classification of cellphones as a possible carcinogen. (That’s the same classification given to coffee and talcum powder.)      Elisabeth Cardis, the lead investigator on the study that spurred that classification, said the NTP report provided “really quite novel findings.”      “A lot of people felt that the issue was closed; there’s nothing there and you can just move on. The release of these results now … really raises the question about whether, in fact, there is a real effect,” she said.      Population implications      But other population-level studies in humans have found no increased risk, and the incidence of brain cancer has not risen in recent decades as cellphone use has exploded.      “These data will probably raise the level of suspicion that there might be a problem. I didn’t see them as strong enough to say that there’s really a problem,” said Kenneth Foster, a bioengineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied radiation and health. “It’s really hard to know just how to interpret these results.”      He noted in particular the finding that male rats exposed to radiation lived longer than those not exposed to radiation.      Michael Lauer, deputy director of extramural research for the NIH, who provided comment to the NTP on the study, said that because of the small sample size, the study’s findings are suspect. “It is much more likely than not that this is not a true finding,” he said.      As recently as Wednesday, the NIH said the study was still under review by unnamed additional experts.      “It is important to note that previous human, observational data collected in earlier, large-scale population-based studies have found limited evidence of an increased risk for developing cancer from cellphone use,” the NIH said in a statement.      The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report’s release, which followed a Wednesday report by the website Microwave News that disclosed what the researchers had found.      The researchers have more data stockpiled that they haven’t reported. They say the rest of the results from the study will likely trickle out starting in late 2017.      Potential firestorm      The new study has the potential to start a firestorm. Until now, there have been conflicting results from other research about whether cellphones cause cancer, but the general takeaway from official authorities was that there is no definitive link — as the NIH statement reiterates.      Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the University of Southern California’s Institute for Global Health, said one of the big takeaways is “we really need a more serious research agenda.”      “I think the public needs to know if there’s any risk,” he said. “I think this is something that needs to be taken as a need for further research and investigation. … We should not say there is no risk.”      The findings could jeopardize the conventional wisdom at a time when the number of Americans who own a cellphone has exceeded 90 percent in recent years.      “None of us expected them to find anything in this study. I’ve been quoted as saying it’s a total waste of money,” said David Carpenter, director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University of Albany.      The results have been long anticipated. An NIH official told Congress in 2009 that the results would likely be released in 2014, but their release appeared to be prompted only by this week’s leak.      “We’ve been waiting a long time for this study, far too long for this study,” said Joel Moskowitz, director and principal investigator at the Center for Family and Community Health at the University of California, Berkeley.      Still, he added: “The debate will keep going on, I’m sure. This is not going to be the definitive study.”      This story has been updated with new details about the study and previous research on cellphones. ||||| Federal scientists released partial findings Friday from a 25-million animal study that tested the possibility of links between cancer and chronic exposure to the type of radiation emitted from cell phones and wireless devices. The findings, which chronicle an unprecedented number of rodents subjected to a lifetime of electromagnetic radiation starting in utero, present some of the strongest evidence to date that such exposure is associated with the formation of rare cancers in at least two cell types in the brains and hearts of rats. The results, which were posted on a prepublication Web site run by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, are poised to reignite controversy about how such everyday exposure might affect human health.      Researchers at the National Toxicology Program (NTP), a federal interagency group under the National Institutes of Health, led the study. They chronically exposed rodents to carefully calibrated radio-frequency (RF) radiation levels designed to roughly emulate what humans with heavy cell phone use or exposure could theoretically experience in their daily lives. The animals were placed in specially built chambers that dosed their whole bodies with varying amounts and types of this radiation for approximately nine hours per day throughout their two-year life spans. “This is by far—far and away—the most carefully done cell phone bioassay, a biological assessment. This is a classic study that is done for trying to understand cancers in humans,” says Christopher Portier, a retired head of the NTP who helped launch the study and still sometimes works for the federal government as a consultant scientist. “There will have to be a lot of work after this to assess if it causes problems in humans, but the fact that you can do it in rats will be a big issue. It actually has me concerned, and I’m an expert.”      More than 90 percent of American adults use cell phones. Relatively little is known about their safety, however, because current exposure guidelines are based largely on knowledge about acute injury from thermal effects, not long-term, low-level exposure. The International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2011 classified RF radiation as a possible human carcinogen. But data from human studies has been “inconsistent,” the NTP has said on its website. Such studies are also hampered by the realities of testing in humans, such as recall bias—meaning cancer patients have to try to remember their cell phone use from years before, and how they held their handsets. Those data gaps prompted the NTP to engage in planning these new animal studies back in 2009.      The researchers found that as the thousands of rats in the new study were exposed to greater intensities of RF radiation, more of them developed rare forms of brain and heart cancer that could not be easily explained away, exhibiting a direct dose–response relationship. Overall, the incidence of these rare tumors was still relatively low, which would be expected with rare tumors in general, but the incidence grew with greater levels of exposure to the radiation. Some of the rats had glioma—a tumor of the glial cells in the brain—or schwannoma of the heart. Furthering concern about the findings: In prior epidemiological studies of humans and cell phone exposure, both types of tumors have also cropped up as associations.      In contrast, none of the control rats—those not exposed to the radiation—developed such tumors. But complicating matters was the fact that the findings were mixed across sexes: More such lesions were found in male rats than in female rats. The tumors in the male rats “are considered likely the result of whole-body exposure” to this radiation, the study authors wrote. And the data suggests the relationship was strongest between the RF exposure and the lesions in the heart, rather than the brain: Cardiac schwannomas were observed in male rats at all exposed groups, the authors note. But no “biologically significant effects were observed in the brain or heart of female rats regardless of modulation.” Based on these findings, Portier said that this is not just an associated finding—but that the relationship between radiation exposure and cancer is clear. “I would call it a causative study, absolutely. They controlled everything in the study. It’s [the cancer] because of the exposure.”      Earlier studies had never found that this type of radiation was associated with the formation of these cancers in animals at all. But none of those studies followed as many animals, for as long or with the same larger intensity exposures, says Ron Melnick, a scientist who helped design the study and is now retired from the NTP.      The new results, published on Web site bioRXiv, involved experiments on multiple groups of 90 rats. The study was designed to give scientists a better sense of the magnitude of exposure that would be associated with cancer in rodents. In the study rats were exposed to RF at 900 megahertz. There were three test groups with each species of each sex, tested at different radiation intensities (1.5, three and six watts per kilogram, or W/kg), and one control group. (The lowest-intensity level roughly approximates the levels allowed by U.S. cell phone companies, which is 1.6 W/kg.) “There are only 90 animals per group, so because there is a trend—and this is the purpose of these assays where you do multiple doses you extrapolate downward and calculate a risk for humans from those trends—so that information is useful. Probably what caused cancer at the high doses will cause cancer at lower doses but to a lesser degree,” Portier says.      Rodents across all the test groups were chronically exposed to RF for approximately nine hours spread out over the course of the day. (Their entire bodies were exposed because people are exposed to such radiation beyond their heads, especially when they carry them or store them in their bras, says John Bucher, the associate director of the NTP.) During the study the rats were able to run around in their cages, and to eat and sleep as usual. The experiments also included both types of modulations emitted from today’s cell phones: Code Division Multiple Access and Global System for Mobile. (Modulations are the way the information is carried, so although the total radiation levels were roughly the same across both types, there were differences in how radiation is emitted from the antenna—either a higher exposure for a relatively short time or a lower exposure for a longer time.) Overall, there was no statistically significant difference between the number of tumors that developed in the animals exposed to CDMA versus GSM modulations. With both modulations and tumor types, there was also a statistically significant trend upward—meaning the incidence increased with more radiation exposure. Yet, drilling down into the data, in the male rats exposed to GSM-modulated RF radiation the number of brain tumors at all levels of exposure was not statistically different than in control males—those who had no exposure at all. “The trend here is important. The question is, ‘Should one be concerned?’ The answer is clearly ‘Yes.’ But it raises a number of questions that couldn’t be fully answered, ” says David Carpenter, a public health clinician and the director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University at Albany, S.U.N.Y.      The findings are not definitive, and there were other confusing findings that scientists cannot explain—including that male rats exposed to the radiation seemed to live longer than those in the control group. “Overall we feel that the tumors are likely related to the exposures,” says Bucher, but such unanswered questions “have been the subject of very intense discussions here.”      The NTP released the partial findings on Friday after an online publication called Microwave News reported them earlier this week. The program will still be putting out other results about the work in rats and additional findings about similar testing conducted in mice. The NIH told Scientific American in a statement, “This study in mice and rats is under review by additional experts. It is important to note that previous human, observational data collected in earlier, large-scale population-based studies have found limited evidence of an increased risk for developing cancer from cell phone use.” Still, the NTP was clearly expecting these findings to carry some serious weight: Ahead of Friday’s publication the NTP said on its Web site that the study (and prior work leading to these experiments) would “provide critical information regarding the safety of exposure to radio-frequency radiation and strengthen the science base for determining any potential health effects in humans.”      In response to media queries, cell phone industry group CTIA–The Wireless Association issued a statement Friday saying that it and the wireless industry are still reviewing the study’s findings. “Numerous international and U.S. organizations including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, World Health Organization and American Cancer Society have determined that the already existing body of peer-reviewed and published studies shows that there are no established health effects from radio frequency signals used in cellphones,” the CTIA statement said.      The Federal Communications Commission, which had been briefed by NIH officials, told Scientific American in a statement, “We are aware that the National Toxicology Program is studying this important issue. Scientific evidence always informs FCC rules on this matter. We will continue to follow all recommendations from federal health and safety experts including whether the FCC should modify its current policies and RF exposure limits.”      This animal study was designed primarily to answer questions about cancer risks humans might experience when they use phones themselves, as opposed to smaller levels of exposure from wireless devices in the workplace or from living or working near cell phone towers. But it may have implications for those smaller levels as well, Portier says.      The findings shocked some scientists who had been closely tracking the study. “I was surprised because I had thought it was a waste of money to continue to do animal research in this area. There had been so many studies before that had pretty consistently not shown elevations in cancer. In retrospect the reason for that is that nobody maintained a sufficient number of animals for a sufficient period of time to get results like this,” Carpenter says.      Exposing rodents to radiation for this type of experiment is a tricky business. First, scientists need to be able to calculate exactly how much the rats should be exposed to relative to humans. Too much exposure would not be a good proxy for human use. And with finely calculated low-level exposure rates, scientists still need to be sure they are not going to heat the animals enough to kill them or to cause other health problems. (Subsequent work will be published on the animals’ temperatures.)      The fact that scientists were able to expose animals to nonionizing radiation (like that emitted by cell phones) and those animals went on to develop tumors but that exposure did not significantly raise the animals' body temperatures was “important” to release, Bucher says.      There are safety steps individuals can take, Carpenter says. Using the speakerphone, keeping the phone on the desk instead of on the body and using a wired headset whenever possible would help limit RF exposure. “We are certainly not going to go back to a pre-wireless age,” he says. But there are a number of ways to reduce exposure, particularly among sensitive populations.”      Editor's Note (5/27/16, 2:10 P.M.): This story was updated to reflect information provided during an NTP press conference and a statement from an industry group. ||||| A giant U.S. study meant to help decide whether cellphones cause cancer is coming back with confusing results.      A report on the study, conducted in rats and mice, is not finished yet. But advocates pushing for more research got wind of the partial findings and the U.S. National Toxicology Program has released them early.      The findings are giving new life to the longstanding debate over whether cellphone use might cause cancer.      They suggest that male rats exposed to constant, heavy doses of certain types of cellphone radiation develop brain and heart tumors.      But female rats didn’t, and even the rats that developed tumors lived longer than rats not exposed to the radiation.      The National Toxicology Program, part of the National Institutes of Health, is still analyzing the findings. But John Bucher, associate director of the program, said the initial findings were so significant that the agency decided to release them. \\"We felt it was important to get that word out,\\" Bucher told reporters on a telephone briefing.      \\"Overall, we feel that the tumors are likely to be related to the exposures.\\"      What they do not show is whether humans are at any risk from using cellphones, or whether using a headset or keeping them away from the head and body might make a difference.      \\"It may well be that current cellphone use is safe.\\" \\"It may well be that current cellphone use is safe.\\"      Dr.Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, says it's good science and will change the way people think about cellphones and cancer risk.      \\"The findings are unexpected; we wouldn’t reasonably expect non-ionizing radiation to cause these tumors,\\" he said.      \\"This is a striking example of why serious study is so important in evaluating cancer risk. It’s interesting to note that early studies on the link between lung cancer and smoking had similar resistance, since theoretical arguments at the time suggested that there could not be a link.\\"      Brain tumors are rare. About 23,770 malignant tumors of the brain or spinal cord will be diagnosed this year, according to the American Cancer Society, and 16,000 people will die from them. And there has not been an increase in rates since the 1990s, when cellphones started to be used.      \\"It is very reassuring in fact that there has been no dramatic increase. It may well be that current cellphone use is safe,\\" Bucher said. Bucher said he has not changed his own cellphone habits because of the findings.      The partial report covers what the researchers considered the most worrying findings.      “The occurrences of two tumor types in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats exposed to RFR (radiofrequency radiation), malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas of the heart, were considered of particular interest, and are the subject of this report,” the team writes in its report. Sprague Dawley rats are a common type of lab rat.      “These findings appear to support the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) conclusions regarding the possible carcinogenic potential of RFR.” IARC, the cancer arm of the World Health Organization, said in 2011 it was possible the devices might cause cancer and recommended further study.      Related: Questions About Cellphone Use and Cancer      Cellphones are used by billions of people around the world — 92 percent of American adults own a cellphone, according to Pew Research Center. Children as young as toddlers carry and use the devices for hours on end, so any hint that they might somehow cause cancer would be of enormous concern.      Previous studies have had very mixed results. One study found that holding a mobile phone next to the head might warm up brain cells, but there was not any clear consequence of that. Studies on rats are considered of only partial reliability, because lab rats have their own unpredictable vulnerabilities to cancer.      For the experiment, a contract lab in Chicago generated cellphone signals, both in the GSM and CDMA radio systems — two major systems used by cellphone providers. They directed the signals into cages with pregnant rats, and then kept the signals focused on the rat pups for 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off, nine hours a day, as they grew for two years.      So called control rats were raised nearby without radiation exposure.      There was little effect on the newborn rats, except the pups appeared to be very slightly lighter when the mothers were exposed to the signals. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A new US government study has discovered a link between cellphones and cancer.

What is the full name of the person Weiss wants to prosecute?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sherman McCoy is a Wall Street bond trader who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin, a Southern belle gold digger. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the \\"war-zone\\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed. Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City.

It is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it. This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time. It seems that 3 young newswomen (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) travel to the small city of Solvang, California to cover a festival when a mix-up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feeling ill, as the other 2 are off to film their story. She is soon murdered at the house, in a VERY cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement). Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover. Jennifer is fighting with her (ex?)lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home, her hosts (whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son) devise a plot to try to murder her as well. Virgina does not totally agree with Earnest's plan to murder Jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets Junior. Here the film turns almost comic as Junior (portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient, manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary. This is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done. The actors/actresses do a terrific job with the material especially Lassick, Furst, and Bach and although it's not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining!

Write a summary based on this article: Feds Bust Air Traveler Trying To Smuggle Liquid Cocaine Disguised As Rum Share      Tweet            A man carrying what appeared to be four bottles of duty-free rum was actually seeking to smuggle liquid cocaine worth 310,000 into the U.S., federal agents allege.      Wilton Sinclair flew last month from Guyana to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. He was traveling with two pieces of luggage and a pair of duty-free bags, each of which contained two large bottles of El Dorado rum (the “liquid gold of Guyana,” according to its manufacturer).      When Sinclair, 35, was screened at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint, agents noticed that the four bottles (seen above) contained a “thick syrup-like substance inconsistent with rum,” according to a criminal complaint.      Officers opened the 1.75-liter bottles and detected an unusual chemical odor. Subsequent tests showed that all four bottles field-tested positive for cocaine. Investigators estimated that the bottles held 8.2 kilos of cocaine.      After waiving his Miranda rights, Sinclair, a Georgia resident who is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Guyana, told agents that he was to be paid 6000 to get the four bottles into the country.      Charged with a felony smuggling count, Sinclair (pictured above) is free on an unsecured 75,000 bond. According to his Facebook page, Sinclair has served in the U.S. Army. ||||| QUEENS, N.Y. — Two rum bottles filled with 18 pounds of liquid cocaine were seized by inspectors at John F. Kennedy Airport from a passenger arriving from Guyana, federal authorities said.            A passenger presented customs with a total of four bottles of rum in two duty-free bags after arriving at JFK, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection service said.      When the liquid inside the bottles appeared thicker than normal, the passenger, Wilton Sinclair, 35, a U.S. citizen who lives in Georgia, was escorted to a private search room and the bottles were opened, the CBP said. After detecting a strong chemical odor, inspectors tested the liquid, which turned out to be a cocaine solution, with an estimated street value of 310,000, the CBP said.

Information:  - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million. This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A Councillor is a member of a local government council.  - Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places. The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature.  - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham .  - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX.  - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.  - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.

Summarize this article: Super Bowl ad controversies have become nearly as interesting as the commercials that get on the air, maybe more so, and that's surely the case with the latest spot rejected by Fox Sports: A 30-second ad aimed at getting viewers to check out the familiar gospel verse, John 3:16.So far this year, Fox has nixed commercials over issues of bad taste and inappropriate content -- which is a pretty high bar, given the popularity of frat boy humor and double entendres in Super Bowl ads, or the single-entendre spots that focus the attention so intently on sexy women that viewers don't actually know what the sponsor does. (Quick, what does GoDaddy.com sell?)Still, thanks to Fox's guidelines, viewers of this Sunday's Super Bowl matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers won't see an ad for an online dating service aimed at spouses looking to have affairs. Or the dueling bobbleheads spot from the conservative comedy site JesusHatesObama.com, in which an angry Jesus doll pushes a smiling Obama doll into a fish bowl. And Fox also put the kibosh on an entry into the annual Pepsi-and-Doritos ad competition that envisioned the snack chip and soft drink as the bread and wine of the Eucharist . Not!So Larry Taunton, head of the Fixed Point Foundation , an Alabama-based organization that seeks to defend Christianity in the public square, figured he was on solid ground with his professionally produced commercial featuring a group of friends drinking beer, eating chips and watching football -- and asking each other what the phrase \\"John 3:16\\" written in a player's eye black means. That was it.\\"We thought in this case, let's put forward something that is understated, that feels secular,\\" Taunton said. Click play to watch video:It was not to be. The Fox Broadcasting Company rejected the commercial, which would have brought in 3 million -- the going rate for a half-minute ad this year -- because under company policy, it \\"does not accept advertising from religious organizations for the purpose of advancing particular beliefs or practices.\\"\\"The Fixed Point Foundation was provided with our guidelines prior to their submission of storyboards for our review,\\" the company said in a statement. \\"Upon examination, the advertising submitted clearly delivers a religious message and as a result has been rejected.\\"It's hard to argue with Fox's point about the spot's religious content. The verse is one in which Jesus tells his listeners, \\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\\"If Fox execs hadn't understood the ad's religious message, then Taunton and Fixed Point would have to go back to the editing suite in order to produce something that would do what any good ad should -- communicate clearly. (The commercial cost Fixed Point just 50,000 to make, about a tenth of what such ads normally cost, and two Fox affiliates, one in Alabama and the Fox station in Washington -- of all places -- said they'll air it during the Super Bowl. Taunton said that if Fox had OK'd the ad for national distribution, he felt sure he could have raised the money to cover the 3 million broadcast fee.)Of course, as always happens when an ad is rejected, the media coverage generated by the controversy is probably more effective P.R. than anything money could buy.Taunton was also quick to exonerate Fox Broadcasting from blame for its decision.\\"They were very courteous and gracious,\\" Taunton stressed. \\"Fox Sports isn't the enemy. We aren't out to demonize them. We think this is more of a cultural issue than it is a Fox Sports issue. Their solution was just to run from it because they think this is something that would offend their viewership. I think we have become so utterly sensitive and politically correct that the result is we end up doing absurd things like this.\\"A more likely explanation is that Fox, like all broadcasters, doesn't want too much controversy, or rather the wrong kind of controversy -- think of Janet Jackson's infamous \\"wardrobe malfunction\\" from the 2004 Super Bowl. CBS, which broadcast last year's Super Bowl, found itself on the defensive for reversing its policy against advocacy ads and allowing a pro-life spot by Heisman-winning quarterback and born-again Christian Tim Tebow -- though the commercial wound up being so subtle it's hard to know if anyone got the anti-abortion message.Moreover, in the case of the Fixed Point Foundation's ad, it's hard to see how a commercial whose only religious reference is a brief shot of a player's eye black and \\"John 3:16\\" could offend an audience of sports fans.Evangelical Christians who consider the verse a kind of motto for their faith have been holding up signs displaying the verse at televised sporting events for years, starting in the 1970s with the \\"Rainbow Man,\\" a.k.a. Rollen Stewart, who wore a distinctive, multi-hued afro wig to draw attention to his placard.Taunton acknowledged that John 3:16 is by now part of the scenery in sports, and especially football, which has a reputation as a culturally conservative sport. There are on-field prayer circles after games, players thanking Jesus after every score, and big-time, publicly professing Christians like Kurt Warner, Drew Brees and Sam Bradford are commonplace.But Taunton believes the John 3:16-themed ad was needed for that very reason.\\"Our thought was this: We're not trying to import Christianity into a sport or into part of the culture where it isn't,\\" he said. \\"We're trying to draw people's attention to the fact that it's already there . . . John 3:16 has become so ubiquitous in the game that people sort of become numb to it.\\"\\"It's sort of like seeing the Nike swoosh,\\" he added. \\"How many people know what that means?\\" (Good question. Answer: it apparently represents the wing of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. But that's not the kind of religious reference to get Michael Jordan ads barred from the airwaves.)Taunton also noted that commercials airing during NFL games for the new exorcism movie, \\"The Rite,\\" are loaded with religious imagery, though the intent seems to scare rather than convert viewers.Indeed, it is religion itself, with its potential to incite furious reactions and its association with political divisions, that really seems to give broadcasters a fright.Taunton agrees, which is why he said the ad was apolitical by design and \\"not in your face\\" with the faith message.The ad's rejection, he said, sends the message that \\"religion, and more specifically Christianity, is increasingly being treated like smoking -- you can only do it in designated areas. You may not bring it into the public space.\\"As a sports fan, Taunton said he'd be happy to have some serious competition for the best religion-themed Super Bowl ad. It would beat another overrated Doritos spot or even race car driver Danica Patrick baring skin for a GoDaddy commercial.\\"If the Hindus want to put out an ad, I'm all for it,\\" Taunton said. \\"Muslims? Bring it on. I'd love to see it. It'd make the Super Bowl a whole lot more interesting.\\" ||||| Check out these screenshots from my Skechers ShapeUps Super Bowl commercial!!

Yet behind the iron gates of the Uruguayan camp in Sete Lagoas, there has been great turmoil and upheaval and an inquest into Saturday’s humbling 3-1 defeat at the hands of Costa Rica. ‘We got really heated up after the game,’ said captain Diego Lugano and although the fury has since subsided it has been replaced by paranoia ahead of Thursday’s date with England.

The loss to Costa Rica has raised many questions about the team's tactics, fitness, and overall performance, with players and staff under immense pressure to deliver a win against Roy Hodgson's men. Head coach Óscar Tabárez and his support staff have been working round the clock, analyzing footage, devising new strategies, and attempting to exploit any weaknesses in the English squad. The usually tight-knit Uruguayan team have found themselves tackling internal divisions as well, with rumors of disagreements between players over tactics and the role of star striker Luis Suarez, whose fitness levels have been a major talking point in the press and among fans. Despite assurances from the Liverpool forward and the coaching staff, doubts over Suarez’s readiness for the tournament persist, and some players have reportedly questioned the wisdom of relying too heavily upon him. As the match day approaches, the atmosphere in the camp has evolved from one of introspection to a more focused, determined state of mind. Discussions among players and staff have been intense, but productive, with the collective effort now directed at making the necessary adjustments to ensure their World Cup dreams do not end in bitter disappointment. Team psychologist Dr. Alberto Pan has been a vital source of support during these trying times, helping the players to regain their confidence and shed the negativity that has gripped the camp since their loss to Costa Rica. Dr. Pan has been working closely with the team to help them maintain their mental equilibrium and fortify their resilience, in the belief that a united and composed mindset will prove crucial in resisting the pressure of the must-win match against England. Meanwhile, back home in Uruguay, the nation has rallied around their team, with fans and media alike offering unwavering support and encouragement. From families gathered around television sets to banners adorning the streets, Uruguayans have demonstrated their belief in their heroes and their conviction that the team has the talent and spirit to overcome their current setbacks and progress to the knockout stages. It is now a matter of whether this sense of national pride and unity can translate onto the field, as Uruguay face the daunting prospect of taking on an England team equally eager to prove their worth after their own opening match defeat. A high-stakes encounter with no room for error is set to unfold in Sete Lagoas, where both teams will be driven by the desperate determination to salvage their World Cup hopes. This could well prove to be a turning point for both nations – which way that turn takes remains to be seen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Although he was born in Amsterdam, the family lived in the village of Slikkerveer. In 1943 the family moved to The Hague, the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during World War II. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with V1 and V2-rocket launchers, which was repeatedly bombed by allied forces. After about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film. Together with his screenwriter Gerard Soeteman, Verhoeven made Black Book (2006). The director was hailed by the host of the Netherlands Film Festival with the words \\"The return of a hero.\\" Black Book eventually won six Golden Calves at this festival, including Best Director. When the shooting of Black Book was delayed due to financial issues, there was speculation about a new production. The film Beast of Bataan had been announced, but once the shooting for Black Book resumed, the other film was never realized. Since his return to European cinema in 2006 with Black Book, Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, but for the moment none of them has come to fruition. Some of those titles were produced with other directors at the helm, such as The Paperboy.  Finally, in a rather unexpected twist, Verhoeven followed Black Book by directing a movie in French: Elle, an adaptation of a novel by Philippe Djian. The film by Verhoeven, a psycho-thriller where Isabelle Huppert plays a rape victim, was selected in the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews.  Verhoeven has been a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 2007. In December 2016 it was announced that Verhoeven would be the President of the Jury for the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, scheduled to take place in February 2017.  In April 2017 his next French film titled Blessed Virgin was announced, to start filming in August of the same year. It is a biographical film about the life of Benedetta Carlini, which will be portrayed by Elle co-star Virginie Efira, and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy by Judith C.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"The two questions are not inquiring about the same information, but they do share a related theme, as they both involve different aspects of energy and motion. To clarify, we will explore each concept and the differences between them individually. 1. Difference between potential and kinetic energy: Potential energy and kinetic energy are two types of mechanical energy that are present in any object under motion or at rest. Potential energy is the stored energy in an object due to its position or state. This energy has the potential to be converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. The most common types of potential energy include gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy. Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is associated with an object's position in a gravitational field, typically near the surface of the Earth or any massive celestial body. The GPE of an object is determined by its mass, the acceleration due to gravity, and its height above a reference point. The formula for gravitational potential energy is: GPE = m × g × h where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height above the reference point. Elastic potential energy is stored in an object when it is deformed by an external force, such as compressing a spring or stretching a rubber band. When the deforming force is removed, the object releases this stored energy and returns to its original shape. The formula for elastic potential energy is: EPE = 1/2 × k × x² where k is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the object), and x is the displacement from its equilibrium position. Kinetic energy, on the other hand, is the energy of motion. When an object is in motion, it possesses kinetic energy, which is a function of its mass and velocity. The formula for kinetic energy is: KE = 1/2 × m × v² where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity. In summary, potential energy is the stored energy that has the potential to be converted into kinetic energy, while kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The key difference between them is that potential energy depends on the position or state of the object, whereas kinetic energy depends on the object's motion. 2. Difference between kinetic energy and momentum: Kinetic energy and momentum are related concepts, but they describe different aspects of an object's motion. As explained earlier, kinetic energy is the energy of motion possessed by an object. It depends on both the mass and the square of the object's velocity. The formula for kinetic energy is: KE = 1/2 × m × v² Momentum, in contrast, is a measure of the \\"quantity of motion\\" of an object and is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. Momentum depends on the object's mass and velocity and is represented by the formula: p = m × v where m is the mass of the object, and v is its velocity. Although both kinetic energy and momentum are related to an object's mass and velocity, they differ in how they are influenced by these factors. Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity and is directly proportional to the square of an object's velocity. This means that a small change in velocity results in a much larger change in kinetic energy. Momentum, on the other hand, is a linear function of velocity, which means its value will change proportionally with velocity. In summary, while potential and kinetic energy describe different aspects of an object's energy, and kinetic energy and momentum describe different aspects of an object's motion, all four concepts relate to the motion and energy of objects. Potential energy is the stored energy that an object possesses due to its position or state, kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion, and momentum is a measure of an object's quantity of motion, depending on its mass and velocity. The main difference between kinetic energy and momentum is that kinetic energy is a scalar quantity and is related to the square of an object's velocity, whereas momentum is a vector quantity and is proportional to the object's velocity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both Labyrinth of Lies by Giulio Ricciarelli and The People vs. Fritz Bauer by Lars Kraume portray the state prosecutor from Stuttgart as a controversial figure in the post-war years—he was Jewish, atheist, and gay, and he wanted those who worked in death camps brought to justice at a time when many Germans wanted to forget or ignore the horrors of the Nazi regime, reports AFP. And though his 1968 death looked like suicide, it remains a topic of debate to this day. \\"My guess is that until now the Germans did not want to honor a person who pointed so openly to their incompetence in dealing with their Nazi past,\\" says the author of a Bauer book. Bauer tipped off Israel that Adolf Eichmann was hiding in Argentina; the Mossad swooped in and kidnapped him in 1960 and he was executed in Israel in 1962. A year later he brought the Nazis who ran Auschwitz to court for the first time in Germany, fueled in part by the nine months he spent in a concentration camp in 1933 just a few years after becoming Germany's youngest judge at 27, reports the Independent. He received hate mail and death threats and is said to have once told a colleague: \\"As soon as I leave the confines of my office, I am on enemy territory.\\" The Independent calls it a \\"belated triumph\\" that half a century later reunited Germany is trying to track down the remaining Holocaust perpetrators, using Bauer's own logic that working in death camps equates complicity in murder.

[ii] drums was simpler to study.","output":"You know that the drums will take longer than the flute to learn, so the flute was simpler to study. Learning to play an instrument is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. As with most skills, there are varying degrees of difficulty and time investment associated with each instrument. In this case, we are comparing the flute and the drums. While it is true that each instrument comes with its own unique set of challenges, the general consensus is that learning to play the flute is relatively quicker and less complex than learning to play the drums. The flute is a woodwind instrument that produces sound by virtue of the player blowing air across a hole (i.e., an aperture or embouchure) on the flute's body. To produce different pitches, the flutist must accurately cover and uncover a series of tone holes with their fingers. While this technique may take some time to master, it is widely regarded as being simpler than the techniques employed by drummers. On the other hand, the drums belong to the percussion family and involve striking various drumheads with sticks (or sometimes hands) to produce sound. A drum kit usually includes multiple drums, such as the snare, tom-toms, and bass drum, as well as other percussion instruments, like cymbals, hi-hats, and cowbells. To play the drums effectively, one must develop an in-depth understanding of rhythm, timing, and coordination, all the while controlling multiple limbs moving independently. This ultimately requires a greater amount of time and practice to build muscle memory and fine motor skills, as well as the capacity to multitask and maintain focus. In summary, the flute is generally regarded as being an easier instrument to learn compared to the drums. While mastering any musical instrument takes dedication and effort, the technical nature of drumming requires a more intricate set of skills and tends to have a steeper learning curve than playing the flute. Therefore, in the context provided, the flute was indeed the simpler instrument to study."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore.  Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size.  \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\"  While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.  India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores.  The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added.  For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\"  The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country.

Modi emphasized that the U.S.-India relationship \\"has assumed new significance in the changing world\\" and that an important aspect of their partnership is a shared vision of an open, stable, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. This indicates that the relationship between the U.S. and India is expected to grow in importance as both nations seek to address shared challenges and maintain stability in the region.

However, a more detailed analysis is necessary before reaching a concrete conclusion. The statement, \\"higher than any other ones and then they said that we'll give you back some of your money\\" raises several red flags that suggest caution and further investigation.  1. Promising extraordinarily high returns: It is important to be cautious when someone promises returns that are significantly higher than those of other investments because it may be too good to be true. Investments that offer higher returns usually come with higher risks, and no investment can guarantee high returns without any risk.  2. The promise to return some of your money while making it sound like it is a favor or a limited-time offer might indicate that the individuals or organization behind the investment may be trying to build a sense of urgency or exclusivity to persuade investors. 3. Lack of transparency: It is essential to have all the relevant information about any investment opportunity, including the individuals or organizations involved, the specific investment strategy being employed, and the potential risks and rewards involved. If the information provided in the given scenario is all that is available, then there is not enough transparency to make an informed decision about the legitimacy and potential success of the opportunity. Given these red flags, it would be reasonable for one to be skeptical and cautious about the investment in question. Nevertheless, it is also important to remember that insufficient information and a potentially misleading initial approach do not definitively prove that this situation is a scam. Before reaching a conclusion, further investigation is needed to determine the legitimacy of the offer, the people involved, and the details of the investment. Conducting thorough research and seeking advice from trustworthy financial advisors are also ways to minimize the risk of falling victim to scams and making poor investment decisions.

Season the patty with salt and pepper. Article:","output":"Title: The Perfectly Seasoned Hamburger: Simple Steps for a Delectable Meal Introduction The humble hamburger is a staple in households across the world, with countless variations and recipes to cater to different tastes. However, many would argue that the key to a great hamburger lies in the perfect seasoning and the cooking process. In this article, we will walk you through two simple yet essential steps in achieving a delectable hamburger: flattening the meat and seasoning the patty with salt and pepper. Flatten the Hamburger Meat Step 1: Choosing the Right Meat The first step in creating the perfect hamburger is selecting the right type of ground meat. While different types of meat can be used, beef is the classic choice due to its distinct flavor and juiciness. The ideal fat-to-lean ratio is approximately 80:20, ensuring that the burger remains moist and full of flavor. Step 2: Forming the Patty Once you have chosen your ground meat, it's time to form the patty. Take a portion of the meat and gently form a ball. Avoid overworking the meat or compressing it too much, as this can make the burger dense and chewy. Step 3: Flattening the Patty Place the ball of meat on a clean surface, such as a parchment paper or plastic wrap, and gently press down until it is about ½ - ¾ inches thick. A flatter, thinner patty will cook more evenly and quickly compared to a thicker one. Additionally, the shape of the patty will affect the final texture of the burger. Slightly indent the center of the patty with your thumb, preventing it from puffing up in the middle during cooking. Season the Patty with Salt and Pepper Step 4: Seasoning the Patty Once the patty is flattened, it's time to season it properly. The classic choice is a simple combination of salt and pepper, which will enhance the natural flavor of the meat without overpowering it. It's important to season both sides of the patty, ensuring an even flavor distribution. Step 5: The Importance of Timing The timing of seasoning plays a crucial role in the final outcome of your hamburger. To avoid drawing out moisture from the meat, season your patty immediately before placing it on the heat source. This will ensure that the patty remains juicy and delicious throughout the cooking process. Conclusion By following these simple steps, you can achieve a perfectly seasoned and cooked hamburger that will impress your guests and satisfy your cravings. Remember that the simplicity of salt and pepper can go a long way in elevating the natural flavors of the meat while maintaining its juiciness. Don't forget to pair your delectable hamburger with your choice of buns and toppings for a complete and satisfying meal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unlike traditional book clubs, the point of the slow reading club isn't exchanging ideas about a certain book, but to get away from electronic devices and read in a quiet, relaxed environment. According to the Journal, the Wellington book club is just one example of a movement started by book lovers who miss the old-fashioned way of reading before the Internet and smartphones.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How do I prepare for the IEO exam? How do I prepare for IEO exam?","output":"Yes, both questions essentially have the same meaning. They both ask about the preparation process for the International English Olympiad (IEO) exam. Although the questions vary slightly in their wording, they are both inquiring about the same topic. Now let's discuss how to prepare for the IEO exam in detail. 1. Understand the exam pattern and syllabus: The first step in preparing for the IEO exam is to familiarize yourself with the exam pattern and the syllabus. The IEO exam primarily assesses your proficiency in the English language, emphasizing grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, verbal and written expression, and spoken English. 2. Gather the necessary study materials: Collect relevant study materials for IEO preparation. This may include school textbooks, English grammar and vocabulary books, and IEO-specific workbooks or guidebooks. Referring to the previous years' question papers and sample papers is also beneficial for understanding the types of questions asked in the exam. 3. Create a study schedule: Design a study plan that allows you to allocate time for each aspect of the IEO syllabus. Ensure that you regularly revise all topics, dedicate more time to your weak areas, and maintain a balance between learning new concepts and practicing questions. Consistency in your study schedule is key to performing well in the IEO exam. 4. Focus on grammar and vocabulary: Grammar and vocabulary are crucial components of the IEO exam. To develop a strong foundation, study the rules of grammar, practice sentence construction, and work on punctuation and spelling. Additionally, expand your vocabulary by learning new words, their meanings, synonyms, and antonyms. Use flashcards, word quizzes, or mnemonic devices to aid your learning. 5. Develop reading and writing skills: Reading comprehension and the ability to express ideas coherently are also essential for the IEO exam. Regularly reading a variety of texts, such as newspapers, magazines, and novels, can help improve your reading speed, comprehension, and analytical skills. Additionally, practice writing essays, summaries, and creative pieces to enhance your written expression. 6. Take practice tests and evaluate your performance: Solve IEO sample papers, mock tests, and previous years' question papers under timed conditions regularly. This not only helps gauge your understanding of the subject matter but also improves your time management skills during the exam. After completing each test, critically assess your answers, identify your weak areas, and work on them. 7. Get help when needed: Seek support from teachers, tutors, or peers if you face difficulties in understanding certain concepts or need guidance. Participate in study groups, attend workshops, or connect with online communities to get additional support. 8. Practice spoken English: Get comfortable speaking in English with friends, family, or even yourself. Participate in group discussions, debates, and presentations in English. This will not only improve your spoken English skills but also help build your confidence in using the language. 9. Stay motivated and maintain a positive attitude: Maintaining a positive mindset and staying motivated is essential throughout your IEO preparation. Set achievable goals, track your progress, and reward yourself for your accomplishments to stay encouraged. 10. Revise and relax before the exam: Dedicate sufficient time for revision before the IEO exam. Avoid studying new topics in the last few days, instead focus on revising the concepts you have already learned. Ensure that you get enough rest and practice relaxation techniques to minimize stress and anxiety during the exam. By following these steps and remaining consistent in your preparation, you will be well-equipped to perform well in the International English Olympiad exam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Dec. 14) AP      Tavis Smiley in 2014. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)      In Tavis Smiley's first live interview since PBS suspended his late-night talk show over \\"multiple, credible allegations\\" of misconduct, the former host appeared on Good Morning America Monday, denying all wrongdoing and arguing the claims are untrue. And PBS was having none of it.      Speaking to ABC News correspondent Paula Faris, Smiley admitted to engaging in workplace relationships, claiming they were consensual.      \\"I certainly understand people who have the viewpoint that any consensual relationship in the workplace is wrong,\\" Smiley said. \\"But there are also other points of view on this. Let me be clear: I own my company, PBS distributes my content. In our employee handbook, while we do not encourage office relationships, we do not forbid them, either. And we don't forbid them because I don't know where your heart is going to lead you. I don't know who you're going to hang out with, or date, or fall in love with. (There may be) millions of Americans watching right now who met their spouse at work.\\"      Smiley also denied fostering a verbally abusive workplace environment, saying, \\"I have an intense environment. ... Some of the most intense places in our business are in control rooms around this country, that's not for everyone, so it might be that the environment wasn't good for you. ... I'm not an angry black man, and this notion of a hostile environment just doesn't fit.\\"      Smiley hosted Tavis Smiley, a half-hour interview program that premiered in 2004 and aired weeknights on PBS stations until it was suspended on Dec. 13. He confirmed to Faris that one woman with whom he engaged in a sexual relationship is still employed on his staff, but claimed that he never gave any of his workplace sexual partners preferential treatment, nor retaliated against them in any way.      Responding to allegations that he sent lewd messages or commented inappropriately on women's' bodies, Smiley said he \\"has no idea\\" about the basis of the claims.      \\"I've never sent lewd messages to anyone. In consensual relationships, we use text messages to communicate,\\" he told Faris. \\"But I've never done that to an employee, ever.\\"      Tavis Smiley pushes back against allegations of sexual misconduct: “I have never groped, I have never coerced, I have never exposed myself inappropriately…I celebrate and applaud these women who’ve had the courage to come out and tell their truth.” pic.twitter.com/VNuxgQczrS — Good Morning America (@GMA) December 18, 2017      When asked about his former network, Smiley claimed that PBS \\"only agreed to talk to me after weeks of investigation they didn't tell me about,\\" after he threatened to sue.      Only under a threat of a lawsuit did they agree to sit down and talk to me,\\" Smiley said. \\"When they did ... they never told me who the accuser was, what the allegations were, never allowed me to provide any information. They didn't give me due process.\\"      In a strongly-worded rebuttal, a PBS spokesperson responded that Smiley \\"needs to get his story straight,\\" arguing the journalist (who has contributed op-ed pieces to USA TODAY and whose status is currently under review) has been inconsistent as to the number of employees with whom he's had sexual contact and questioning the sincerity of his support for the women who came forward when his company required them to sign non-disclosure agreements.      \\"Witnesses who have bravely come forward to speak with the independent investigators retained by PBS report a fear of retribution for speaking out,\\" the network said, noting, \\"Additional allegations are continuing to come to light since last week’s announcement.\\"      The statement continued, \\"PBS stands by the integrity of its investigation, which has been conducted by an outside firm with expertise in such matters. Mr. Smiley’s own words today coupled with the information discovered during the investigation confirms PBS’ decision to indefinitely suspend the distribution of Tavis Smiley.\\"      Other fallout      Meanwhile, Mills Entertainment announced Friday it is pulling out of backing a nationwide 40-city tour of Death of a King: A Live Theatrical Experience, a show based on Smiley's 2014 book focusing on the last year in the life of Martin Luther King Jr.      Mills' statement said that \\"in light of the recent allegations\\" it will be \\"suspending our relationship with\\" Smiley. \\"We take seriously the allegations,\\" the statement added according to the Associated Press and The New York Times.      Smiley is the second PBS late-night host to face allegations of sexual misconduct, following the derailing of Charlie Rose's career on PBS and CBS.

He's a man who used to have a show on TV where he talked to different people. But then some people said he did bad things at his work, like saying not-nice things to people or making them feel uncomfortable. Because of this, the TV people said, \\"We can't show your program on our channel anymore.\\" So, Tavis went on another TV show to say, \\"I didn't do anything wrong. Yes, I had a girlfriend or two at work, but it was okay because we liked each other. And yes, I can be serious at work, but I wasn't mean.\\" However, the TV people still didn't believe him. They said they talked to other people who worked with Tavis and they were scared to talk because they didn't want to get in trouble. Lastly, Tavis was supposed to go on a tour for a play he made based on a book he wrote, but the company who was supporting him pulled out due to these allegations. This situation is a reminder that it's important to always be kind and respectful to others, at work and everywhere else!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Whenever I see this question I want to scream at the person 'no, don't do it. It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing. Before I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary. Why detoxes don't work Firstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How did Veet convince Chinese women that any body hair was unsightly?

Review: I am a VERY big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is horrible. At the time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and he was the director of this film and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film. Now I know why they don't make big budget porn movies anymore. In a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but this is the real world and they can't act. That's why there porn stars, if a women as beautiful as Jenna could act, then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn. Just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star. A fine example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teen thru her 20's she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women on earth. She made her move into low budget mainstream films and couldn't act. Where is she now?

Write an article based on this summary: Two more men have been charged over the 22 March Brussels attacks, after they were linked to a safe house said to have been used by one of the bombers. Article:","output":"Title: Two Additional Suspects Charged in Connection to 2016 Brussels Attacks Introduction Belgian authorities have recently charged two more men in connection to the terrorist attacks that occurred in Brussels on March 22, 2016. These individuals were reportedly connected to a safe house used by one of the bombers before the attacks.  Background on the 2016 Brussels Attacks On March 22, 2016, three coordinated suicide bombings occurred in Brussels, Belgium. Two bombings took place at the Brussels Airport, while another occurred at the Maalbeek Metro Station. These attacks resulted in 32 civilians being killed and over 300 others injured. The extremist group ISIS claimed responsibility for the bombings, further exacerbating concerns over terrorism in Europe. The Investigation A prolonged, meticulous investigation led by Belgian authorities has identified multiple individuals involved in the planning and execution of the attacks. As the case continues to unfold, new evidence links more suspects to the terrorists involved in the bombings. The Charged Suspects The two suspects recently charged have not yet been named, but it has been reported that they were linked to a safe house used by one of the bombers. The safe house was likely employed as a location for the attackers to prepare and coordinate the bombings. Authorities have not disclosed further details about the involvement of those two individuals. Through extensive collaboration, local and international law enforcement agencies have made significant strides in tracking down suspects associated with the attacks. Several other individuals involved in the planning, coordination, and execution of the attacks have already been brought to justice. Ongoing Efforts to Combat Terrorism In addition to pursuing suspects, Belgian authorities continue their efforts to prevent further terrorist attacks. This includes monitoring extremist groups, sharing intelligence with other countries, and taking extensive measures to enhance security in public spaces such as airports and metro stations. The charging of these two individuals makes it clear that law enforcement agencies remain vigilant in their efforts to investigate and prosecute those who have participated in terrorist activities. The determination to bring those responsible for the Brussels attacks to justice serves as a testament to ongoing global efforts to combat terrorism. Conclusion The recent charges against two more individuals linked to the 2016 Brussels attacks demonstrate the commitment of Belgian authorities and international law enforcement to hold those involved accountable. By continuing to pursue leads and piece together evidence, authorities strive to deliver justice to the victims and their families while working to prevent future acts of terror."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Jordanes in Getica recounts \`\` For this Attila was the son of Mundzucus , whose brothers were Octar and Ruas , who were supposed to have been kings before Attila , although not altogether of the same ( territories ) as he '' .  - De origine actibusque Getarum (\\"\\"The Origin and Deeds of the Getae/Goths\\"\\"), or the Getica, written in Late Latin by Jordanes (or \\"Iordanes/Jornandes\\") in or shortly after 551 AD, claims to be a summary of a voluminous account by Cassiodorus of the origin and history of the Gothic people, which is now lost. However, the extent to which Jordanes actually used the work of Cassiodorus is unknown. It is significant as the only remaining contemporaneous resource that gives the full story of the origin and history of the Goths. Another aspect of this work is its information about the early history and the customs of Slavs.  - Attila (or ; fl. circa 406453), frequently referred to as Attila the Hun, was the ruler of the Huns from 434 until his death in March 453. Attila was a leader of the Hunnic Empire, a tribal confederation consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans among others, on the territory of Central and Eastern Europe.  - The Huns were a nomadic people who lived in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia between the 1st century AD and the 7th century AD. As per European tradition, they were first reported living east of the Volga River, in an area that was part of Scythia at the time; the Huns' arrival is associated with the migration westward of a Scythian people, the Alans. In 91 AD, the Huns were said to be living near the Caspian Sea and by about 150 had migrated southeast into the Caucasus. By 370, the Huns had established a vast, if short-lived, dominion in Europe.  - Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator (c. 485  c. 585), commonly known as Cassiodorus, was a Roman statesman and writer serving in the administration of Theoderic the Great, king of the Ostrogoths. \\"Senator\\" was part of his surname, not his rank.  - Uldin, also spelled Huldin (died before 412), was one of the primary Hunnic rulers mentioned by name.  - Rugila or Ruga (also Ruas; died second half of the 430s AD), was a ruler who was a major factor in the Huns early victories over the Roman Empire. He served as an important forerunner with brother Octar, with whom initially ruled in dual kingship, possibly a geographical division where Rugila ruled over Eastern Huns while Octar over Western Huns, during the 5th century AD.    What is the relationship between 'mundzuk' and '434'?","output":"Mundzuk was a Hunnic chieftain and the father of Attila the Hun. The connection between Mundzuk and the year 434 lies in the fact that Attila became the ruler of the Huns in 434 AD. Alongside his brother Bleda, Attila inherited the leadership of the Hunnic Empire, a tribal confederation consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans, among others, in Central and Eastern Europe. Attila ruled the Huns from 434 until his death in March 453, and he is often referred to as Attila the Hun."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies?

Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen)âinfamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War IIâand bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as an ethnic German married couple from Argentina and Rachel plants herself as a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. Both Stefan and David develop an attraction to Rachel. Rachel shows a preference for David, yet sleeps with Stefan shortly after David rebukes her advances. This tryst leads to Rachel becoming pregnant. Stefan also reveals to Rachel that David lost his entire family in The Holocaust. At a doctors appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance, barely ahead of the real ambulance team. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at Wollankstrasse Station, on a railway line along the sector boundary between East and West Berlin, and next to a mail depot. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting East German guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to collect the compromised Rachel. The agents are left with no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction. The agents take turns monitoring and feeding Vogel, who attempts to...

Bugs freak Sarah out, while Katrina is a lover of them","output":"Indeed, Sarah was always one person who could never understand the fascination with bugs. The idea of them crawling with their numerous legs, their shells, the way some of them buzzed - everything about them simply sent chills down her spine. She tried not to judge those who did enjoy studying or interacting with bugs, yet she couldn't wrap her mind around it. Katrina, on the other hand, adored them with a passion that was alien to Sarah. Katrina lived with an enthusiasm for bugs that Sarah found both bewildering and slightly mind-boggling. Her room looked like an entomologist's dream. Different kinds of live bugs were housed in individual terrariums, each designed to replicate their natural habitats. Posters of insects filled the spaces between the terrariums on her wall. Books about insects and spiders littered the tabletops and the floor around her table and bed. Even her clothes and accessories had bug motifs. Katrina's love for bugs went deep. As others felt for dogs, cats, and other more \\"conventional\\" pets, she felt for bugs. She diligently fed her live specimens, monitored their health, and cleaned the environments she kept them in. She spent hours poring over her bug-focused texts, learning and discovering further curious truths about her little, shelled friends. Katrina wasn't satisfied with just being a bug lover; she was an ambassador, advocate, and student for them. Sarah and Katrina, despite being polar opposites in their emotion for bugs, were the best of friends. In their own weird, unexpected synergy, they balanced each other out. Sarah was a neat freak, and though Katrina's room was filled with bugs, it was an antiseptic cleanliness that would make a five-star hotel jealous. Sarah would ensure that, while Katrina spent her time taking care of her many-legged friends. Their adventures were many. Like the time they stumbled upon an unknown type of beetle during a field trip. Sarah, ever the supportive friend, battled her revulsion to help Katrina examine it for scientific analysis. It led to that paper Katrina got published in a junior science journal. Or when Sarah faced her fears to let a ladybug land on her, encouraged by Katrina's calm nature and educational words about the bug's harmless nature. Though bugs freaked Sarah out, and Katrina was a lover of them; both learnt a lot from each other's differences. Sarah realized that though she wouldn't go out of her way to engage with bugs, she didn't have to be irrationally afraid of them. In return, through interacting with Sarah, Katrina learned about tidy habits, engaging with people, and the world outside of bugs and bug-based research. In the grand scheme of things, Sarah's bug-phobic tendencies and Katrina's bug-loving habits played off each other well, showing one important message: It takes all kinds to make the world. After all, just like us humans, even bugs have their haters, lovers, and those who couldn't care. And often it's in these contrasting viewpoints, that we begin to understand, accept, and respect different perspectives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which country had less acid precipitation fall in forests?  Italy and Greece attended the World Ecological Conference. they were looking for solutions to improve their environment. Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought.  Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, it can be inferred that Greece had less acid precipitation fall in forests compared to Italy. The paragraph mentions that Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought. Since air pollution is a contributing factor to the formation of acid rain, it is likely that Italy experienced more acid precipitation than Greece. Acid rain forms when sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides – mainly released from coal-fired power plants and motor vehicle exhaust – react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form acidic compounds. These acidic compounds then fall to the ground in the form of precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. Acid rain is particularly damaging to forests, freshwater habitats, and soils, as it can kill insects, aquatic life, and lead to soil degradation due to its very low pH. In summary, Greece likely had less acid precipitation fall in forests compared to Italy, as Italy's air was heavily polluted, which contributes to the formation of acid rain, while Greece faced issues with drought instead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The hypothesis presented is \\"Flags on a boat blow in the wind.\\" This statement suggests that the flags are specifically on a boat and are affected by the wind.  To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, we must analyze the information provided in each statement. Although the premise mentions flags and the fact that they are fluttering in the wind, there is no specific information about the location of the flags, whether they are on a boat, or any other context about their surroundings.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies a more specific situation, where the flags are on a boat and blowing in the wind. However, the premise does not offer any details about the flags' placement or association with a boat, making it impossible to confirm or refute the hypothesis solely based on the information given in the premise. In conclusion, the premise does not provide enough information to determine if the hypothesis is true or false. Although both statements involve flags and their movement in the wind, the premise lacks the necessary contextual details about the flags' location, and as such, it cannot be deduced whether the flags are, in fact, on a boat or blowing in the wind due to some other scenario.

Question: suppose sulfur dioxide carried all over the world happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"B: Less The process you have provided states that one type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air, which might contribute to global warming. Another example of air pollution mentioned is the damage to the ozone layer from methane gas and CFCs. Lastly, acid rain is created when gases like sulfur dioxide are released into the atmosphere and later washed out by rain, which can cause harm to forests and aquatic life. Now, let's consider the hypothetical scenario where sulfur dioxide is carried all over the world. In this situation, the impact of sulfur dioxide might slightly lessen the harmful effects of other pollutants on the environment. This is because sulfur dioxide can have some cooling properties when released into the atmosphere. It can form sulphate aerosols that reflect sunlight back into space, effectively cooling the Earth's surface. Nevertheless, while the overall cooling effect might counterbalance some negative consequences of pollution, it is essential to bear in mind that sulfur dioxide is not a solution to air pollution. Increased levels of sulfur dioxide can have harmful impacts on human health, including respiratory problems, irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and even cause the formation of acid rain, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, a consistent rise in sulfur dioxide levels could generate an imbalance in global climate systems, causing further environmental issues. To conclude, the presence of sulfur dioxide spread all over the world may have the potential to marginally lessen the negative impacts of certain air pollutants, particularly those contributing to global warming. However, the harmful effects of sulfur dioxide itself could increase, leading to severe consequences for both human health and the environment. Therefore, instead of relying on sulfur dioxide, it is crucial to take appropriate actions to reduce all forms of air pollution and seek sustainable alternatives for a healthy environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
