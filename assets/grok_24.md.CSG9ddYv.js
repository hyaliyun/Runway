(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\" correctly answer the question \\"What is the name of the president who made provocative statements to the media?\\"? Choices: 1. no 2. yes","output":"2. yes The correct answer is \\"yes\\" because in the text it says that \\"As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran\\" and that \\"the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media.\\" So, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the president who made the provocative statements to the media.

Title: The Mexican Movie plot: The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival.

A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Food - Water enter the body - Bloodstream - Food and water enter the pancreas - The pancreas breaks down carbs - Helps digest other foods and liquids.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"a person doesnt have access to clean water\\" happens, how will it affect \\"the body isnt being hydrated\\".  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The process described involves the intake of food and water into the body, entering the bloodstream, and the role of the pancreas in breaking down carbohydrates and helping in the digestion of other foods and liquids. To answer the perturbation hypothesis: if a person does not have access to clean water, it will undoubtedly have effects on the body's ability to maintain proper hydration. The perturbation can influence the entire process, both directly and indirectly. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced water intake: Adequate clean water is crucial for maintaining hydration and ensuring the smooth digestion and absorption of nutrients. Insufficient water intake can lead to dehydration, leading to reduced blood volume, impaired circulation, and difficulty in nutrient absorption and transportation through the bloodstream. 2. Impaired digestion: Water is essential for the proper functioning of the digestive system. It helps in the breakdown of food and facilitates the absorption of nutrients by the bloodstream. A lack of sufficient water can lead to indigestion, resulting in discomfort and reduced nutrient absorption. 3. Pancreatic dysfunction: Water is necessary for proper digestion, as it allows the pancreas to secrete enzymes and hormones effectively. Insufficient hydration could negatively impact this process by inhibiting enzyme secretion and the appropriate breakdown of carbohydrates in the pancreas. Indirect Effects: 1. Increased risk of infection: Unclean water can contain bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause gastrointestinal illnesses. These infections can lead to diarrhea and vomiting, further exacerbating dehydration and disrupting the body's ability to absorb nutrients properly. 2. Malnutrition: Prolonged intake of contaminated water can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, as the body struggles to absorb them efficiently due to impaired digestion. Malnutrition can, in turn, compromise the body's immune system and overall functioning. 3. Electrolyte imbalances: Dehydration and diarrheal diseases caused by contaminated water can lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can disrupt various bodily functions, including digestion. Electrolytes are vital for maintaining the balance of fluids within the body, enabling the proper absorption of nutrients, and ensuring that the pancreas can effectively secrete the necessary enzymes. In conclusion, the perturbation of not having access to clean water can have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process of food and water entering the body, the bloodstream, and the role of the pancreas in digestion. Insufficient hydration can lead to a cascade of consequences, ultimately affecting the body's ability to properly absorb nutrients and maintain overall health. It is crucial to ensure access to clean water to promote adequate hydration, support digestive processes, and maintain overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He said the cuts would be \\"equivalent to 50p in every £100\\" of public spending by 2020, which was \\"not a huge amount in the scheme of things\\". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the world was \\"more uncertain\\" than at any time since the financial crisis. He said the UK needed to live within its means to withstand economic shocks. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for more long-term investment to enable the UK economy to \\"withstand the global headwinds\\". Mr Osborne warned of cuts to come in his upcoming Budget on 16 March in a BBC interview last month. Speaking on the Marr Show, Mr Osborne said the world was now \\"a more difficult and dangerous place\\" and warned about the state of the global economy. While Britain was better placed to cope with economic shocks compared with 2008, it was \\"not immune to what's going on\\", he said. \\"My message in this Budget is that the world is a more uncertain place than at any time since the financial crisis and we need to act now so we don't pay later,\\" he said. \\"That is why I need to find additional savings equivalent to 50p in every £100 the government spends by the end of the decade, because we've got to live within our means to stay secure. \\"That's the way we make Britain fit for the future.\\" The chancellor - whose Budget on Wednesday will be his eighth - said he thought the savings were achievable, but he would not be drawn on where the axe would fall. He said the government's plan had enabled it to invest in \\"the public's priorities\\", such as the NHS, science and education, infrastructure and defence, \\"while at the same time not spending more than the country can afford\\". Mr Osborne added that he wanted to boost productivity, improve Britain's schools and infrastructure and make taxes \\"more competitive\\". The chancellor declined to be drawn on whether fuel duty would be increased - something Tory backbenchers are urging him against. But he added: \\"On fuel duty, we had a manifesto commitment there and we have pencilled in fuel duty plans going forward but what I would say is, every time we can have our economy more competitive, we do.\\" Mr Osborne also rejected claims that the most vulnerable people would be hit in the Budget through cuts to disability benefits known as Personal Independence Payments (PIP). He said the government was \\"increasing spending on disabled people\\", but added that it was right to make sure the system was being \\"properly managed\\". Also on Marr, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for more long-term investment in the UK economy, specifically in skills, infrastructure and new technology. He said the chancellor had reduced investment to 1.4% of GDP which was \\"unacceptable\\", saying the OECD has said the figure should be at least 3%. \\"What I want to do is to make sure we invest in the long term and then we can withstand the global headwinds,\\" he added. He said prosperity needed to be \\"shared by all\\", saying the government's economic policies had created an \\"unequal\\" society. The chancellor has promised to get the books into surplus by 2020. In his November Autumn Statement, he watered down planned £4.4bn cuts to tax credits and eased back on planned spending cuts to the Home Office and other departments. He was able to do this owing to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt. BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said: \\"Only four months ago, when he made the Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne had sounded upbeat about the country's finances. \\"But now, with the size of the British economy much smaller than had been expected, it seems the chancellor has not left himself much wriggle room.\\" In his Marr interview, Mr Osborne also warned against the UK leaving the EU, saying it \\"would create an economic shock\\" that would \\"cost jobs\\" and \\"damage living standards\\". Leave campaigners say the UK could strike favourable trade deals with the EU after exit, arguing that Britain's future if better off outside. Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell said he and the Labour shadow cabinet would be \\"on the stump\\" campaigning for a remain vote amid criticism Labour has been quiet in the campaign. What was that article about?","output":"This article talks about the UK's chancellor, Mr. Osborne, who said that by 2020 there will be some cuts in public spending, which would be like saving 50p in every £100 spent. This is because the world is more uncertain now, and the UK needs to be careful with its money so it can handle any problems that might happen.  Mr. Osborne is also planning to make the country better by improving things like schools, roads, and making taxes more fair. He wants the UK to be ready for the future, and that means making some changes now. Mr McDonnell from the Labour party says that the UK should also invest in things like skills, technology, and infrastructure to make the economy strong and able to handle any challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Enter the Shoguns: Japan's austere, ruthless, but statesmanlike new ruler, Yoritomo Minamoto, set up his government in Kamakura (just south of modern Tokyo), well away from the \\"softening\\" influence of court life that had been the undoing of his predecessor, Kiyomori. First of the national rulers to take the title of sei-i tai-shogun (\\"barbarian-subduing great general\\"), Minamoto expanded and consolidated his power by confiscating lands from some of the defeated Taira and redistributing them to his samurai vassals. Minamoto died in 1199, and the feudal structure passed intact to the tutelage of his widow's family, the Hojo, who were content to play regent to a figurehead shogun, in much the same way as the Fujiwara had done with the emperor. The fiction of Japanese imperial power had become infinitely extendable. The emperor at Kyoto — still seconded by a Fujiwara regent at court — legitimized a Minamoto who was himself a military dictator controlled by a Hojo regent. In a country where form and substance were inextricably interrelated, two things counted in politics: symbolic authority and real power. Neither could exist without the other. A thwarted Mongol invasion in 1274 weakened the Kamakura regime. The fighting brought none of the usual spoils of war that provincial warlords and samurai had come to expect as payment.

British house price rises slightly for second month in September British housing market grew slightly for the second month in succession in September, showing further evidence of checking effects by five interest rates hikes since last November  What is this text about?","output":"The text is essentially about the recent developments in the British housing market. More specifically, it talks about the steady and continuous growth of housing prices for two consecutive months, in this case, August and September. The article seems to suggest that this upward trend in house prices is an indication that the market is gradually but consistently experiencing growth or at least stability, which is considered to be a positive sign in terms of the overall state of the economy. Furthermore, the text implies that the growth in house prices has managed to persist despite five interest rate hikes, instituted since the previous November. In general, interest rate hikes are intended to slow down the economy by making borrowing more expensive which in turn reduces spending and hence slows down inflation. When interest rates increase, people are less likely to take out mortgages due to higher costs, which can often lead to a decrease in demand for housing and therefore a drop in house prices. However, in this case, the British housing market has not followed this expected trend. Despite the increase in interest rates, the housing prices in Britain have continued to rise for two successive months. This could potentially suggest a strong demand for housing in Britain, either due to a shortage of supply, increased buying power of the public, or high investor confidence in the real estate market. It is also worthwhile to note that this trend might speak about the resilience of the British housing market which has checked, or resisted, the potentially negative impacts of the interest rate hikes. The continuous improvement in house prices may also indicate the strength and robustness of the housing sector within the larger framework of the British economy. However, a more in-depth analysis would be required to fully understand the reasons behind this scenario, as housing prices can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including but not limited to government regulations, changes in demographic trends, and fluctuations in foreign investment. Irrespective of the causes, these indications of growth may inspire confidence in those dealing in or with the housing market, be it homeowners, buyers, investors, real estate companies, or even economic policy makers."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question 2: What is the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium? Select from:  *no.  *yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1:  1. Atomic mass: Atomic mass is the mass of an atom, and it's usually measured in atomic mass units (amu). Imagine if an atom is a tiny jelly bean that has a certain weight. 2. Mass number: Mass number is the total number of protons and neurons in an atom. It's like counting all the red and blue balls inside a box. 3. Atomic weight: Atomic weight is the average mass of all atoms of an element found in nature, measured in amu. Think of it like taking a bunch of the same kind of jelly beans and finding their average weight. 4. Relative atomic mass: Relative atomic mass is the ratio of the average mass of one atom of an element to 1/12th of the mass of one carbon-12 atom. Imagine comparing the weight of one jelly bean to the weight of a special jelly bean (carbon-12), but we only consider 1/12th of that special jelly bean's weight. Question 2:  To find the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium, you first need to know the atomic mass of potassium, which is about 39 amu. Multiply the atomic mass by the number of atoms: _mass = atomic mass x number of atoms_ _mass = 39 amu x 11 atoms_ _mass = 429 amu_ Now convert this mass from amu to grams using the conversion factor (1 amu = 1.66 x 10^-24 grams): _mass in grams = 429 amu x 1.66 x 10^-24 grams/amu_ _mass in grams ≈ 7.12 x 10^-23 grams_ So, the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium is approximately 7.12 x 10^-23 grams.

Paragraph: In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.  Question: \\"Who was considered a threat to the U.S Government?\\" Answer: \\"Khaladan\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is not correct. Based on the paragraph, the threat to the U.S. government was considered to be Usama Bin Laden and his associates, not \\"Khaladan.\\" The Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, mentioned in the paragraph, was a training site where individuals like Raed Hijazi learned guerrilla warfare and became part of terrorist plots.

This way, the food will reheat more evenly, because the microwave's energy can reach all the parts of the food easily without overcooking some areas.  Using an empty circle (option B) may not be as effective because it can leave some areas of the food closer together, which might cause uneven heating. The square shape ensures there's the same amount of space between each corner, helping the food heat up evenly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid.  Answer this question please: Which compound would have higher boiling point, compound A or compound B? Answer:","output":"Compound A, the polar compound, would have a higher boiling point compared to compound B, the nonpolar compound. This can be explained by the properties and behavior of polar compounds as well as the energy needed for the changes in their state. Polar compounds are formed when atoms unequally share their electrons, resulting in positive and negative electric charges within the molecule. This charge difference leads to the formation of dipoles, which in turn are responsible for the forces known as hydrogen bonds. Although hydrogen bonds are comparatively weaker than covalent or ionic bonds, their cumulative effects significantly influence the properties of polar compounds, including their melting and boiling points. The energy required for a polar compound to break these hydrogen bonds and change its state from solid to liquid (melting) or from liquid to gas (boiling) is higher than that required for nonpolar compounds, which lack these dipole-dipole interactions. This additional energy accounts for polar compounds having relatively high melting and boiling points than nonpolar compounds. In the given situation, Mike observed this phenomenon by changing the states of two different compounds. In case A, he melted a polar compound, effectively breaking the hydrogen bonds as energy was introduced. In case B, he melted a nonpolar compound, which lacks hydrogen bonds and thus required less energy for the same state transition. Given the background information and the experimental setup, it can be deduced that compound A, the polar compound, would have a higher boiling point than compound B, the nonpolar compound. This is due to the additional energy needed to overcome the hydrogen bonds in polar compounds and the absence of such bonds in nonpolar compounds."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a statement written in Malayalam.

Answer the following question: What causes Jefferson to receive severe burns?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Jefferson Reed is a mild-mannered school teacher in Washington, D.C. His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called The Golden Lords, led by  Simon Caine and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers. One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin. Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries. Jeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular abilities such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with dogs (which he uses to communicate with his own dog, Ellington), and telekinesis. Confiding this to his parents Ted and Maxine, they convince him to use his powers to help the community. His mother designs a costume and as the Meteor Man, he takes on the Golden Lords. He shuts down 15 crack houses, stops 11 robberies, brings peace between the police, the Crips, and the Bloods where they begin to work together to rebuild the community they destroyed, and plants a giant garden in the middle of the ghetto.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

Title: Cyrano de Bergerac Movie plot: In a Paris theater in 1640, a play begins before a fairly full house. After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (José Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clichéd comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose.

Plot title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final.

There's nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies? This film rips the guts out of Orwell's tough novel, turning it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. 'Aspidistra' may not be Orwell's best work, but no-one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty. Orwell emphasises not only the cold and the hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a bleak, grey, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays for it to be blasted away by a squadron of bombers. But this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing, and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s London, in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight, and even the slums of Lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish-strewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate-box world. Worst of all is the script's relentless bonhomie, ancient jokes, and clunking dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the film is packed with great actors. But it's all for nothing. This film made me so angry! Britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its richness, complexity and power. And what do we do with it?

It shows growth from a band that has been around over a decade, with songs such as Everything I Know or Counting on Me. It shows that even though you can grow as artists you can still remember your roots, such as Let's Do This Now where Jon Davis brings back his bagpipes or the Duet with Nas on Play Me. The sound is more aggressive, which is something you would think would be hard to do with the bass lines produce from Fieldy's Bass. Jon does just an awesome variety on his vocals.

They are heavy and they are very different, which is good on this CD. Much has changed since the days of Self-Titled, but with this album Korn shows that even though you can mature as artists, you can always remember where you came from and produce a hard hitting song.

The reviewer speaks highly of Korn's growth as a band and their ability to maintain their roots while evolving with their music.

It may have changed owners since then...not sure...We live in McDowell Mountain Ranch and like to frequent our neighborhood restaurants and 'keep it in the community' as much as possible.  Yes, this place has decent 2-4-1 happy hour...  BUT IT IS DDDDDDISGUSTING!!!!!!  Their sushi is terrible, and we've even gone back for more punishment to give it a 2nd and 3rd chance because it is sooo close to our house.  Anyone who thinks that their sushi is great obviously does NOT know what sushi is supposed to taste like.  If you want to eat badly undercooked, over riced, messy looking rolls, go right ahead, I warned you. All their rolls look look like futomaki rolls LOL  The regular food is decent, but overpriced for what you get.  13 for Chicken Teriyaki?  15 for a meager portion of salmon? Uhhh, I think that is a royal rip off.  I feel bad, because I know these are rough times for businesses, and the place has been pretty dead every time we've been in, but you would think that when times are this hard, and one has so many options of places to eat, that at least the service would improve!  The very last (I mean it this time!) time we were there, we sat at the bar to grab a quick bite.  The bartender/server didn't even acknowledge us for drinks several minutes, even though he saw us sitting there, and one other table, to the point where we almost walked out to go elsewhere.   Now we know better and drive to Sushi Brokers for their happy hour instead. You should too! Choices:  (A). negative  (B). positive","output":"The following review is (A). negative. The review contains numerous complaints about different aspects of the restaurant experience. The mention of the place being good in the past implies that the current state of the restaurant is not up to par. Reasons for this negative review include dissatisfaction with the quality of sushi, claims of overpricing for meals, and subpar service, particularly from the bartender/server. The reviewer feels that their expectations were not met and that there are better alternatives like Sushi Brokers for happy hour. In addition to the specific criticisms, the overall tone of the review is negative. The text is filled with negative descriptors, such as \\"DDDDDDISGUSTING\\", \\"badly undercooked\\", \\"over riced\\", \\"messy looking rolls\\" and \\"royal rip off\\". The reviewer also mentioned having given the restaurant multiple chances and feeling disappointed each time.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Venice, California, student Daisy (Merissa Mathes) leaves a club alone after having an argument with her beatnik boyfriend Max (Carl Schanzer). Walking through the deserted streets, she stops to admire some gruesome paintings in a gallery window painted by artist Antonio Sordi (Campbell), who coincidentally also comes by to look in on his \\"lost children.\\" After a friendly conversation, Sordi convinces the young woman to pose nude for him that night. At his bell-tower studio, Sordi is possessed by the spirit of a long-dead ancestor and suddenly transforms into a vampiric monster who hacks the screaming Daisy to death with a cleaver. Afterwards, he lowers her mutilated corpse into a vat of boiling wax. Sordi, in his vampire form, stalks Venice in search of victims; he is able to do so freely at all hours. In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment. Another victim is approached at a party, chased into a swimming pool, and drowned there after the other guests have moved into the house. The murdered women are carried back to Sordi's studio and painted by the artist, their bodies then covered in wax. Max wants to make up with Daisy but cannot find her anywhere. Learning that she has posed for Sordi and become the subject of the latest in the artist's series of \\"Dead Red Nudes,\\" he visits her sister Donna (Sandra Knight) to ask her forgiveness. Donna tells Max she hasn't seen Daisy for days, and is concerned about the recent rash of disappearances. She reads Max the legend of Sordi's 15th-century ancestor Erno, a painter condemned to be burned at the stake for capturing his subjects' souls on canvas. Unable to convince Max that Antonio Sordi might also be a vampire, she confronts the artist at his studio and asks him if he has seen Daisy. He angrily brushes her off. That night, he later follows her through the streets and murders...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.  Question: \\"Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most of the surrounding counties the criminal contempt charge is what?\\" Answer: \\"She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not correct.

She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement. Donna is offended and the couple break up, which turns out to have been Christabel's plan all along. With Curtis now available, Christabel rebuffs a marriage proposal from Nick, whose novel is about to be published by Caine.

Information:  - An expansion team is a brand new team in a sports league, usually from a city that has not hosted a team in that league before, formed with the intention of satisfying the demand for a local team from a population in a new area. Sporting leagues also hope that the expansion of their competition will grow the popularity of the sport generally. The term is most commonly used in reference to the North American major professional sports leagues but is applied to sports leagues in other countries with a closed franchise system of league membership. The term comes from the expansion of the sport into new areas. That sometimes results in the payment of an expansion fee to the league by the new team and an expansion draft to populate the new roster.  - Peter Clay Carroll (born September 15, 1951) is an American football coach who is the head coach and executive vice president of the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL).

The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.  - A quarterback (commonly abbreviated to QB) is a position in American and Canadian football.

It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume and the third-largest by surface area, after Lake Superior and Lake Huron (and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia). To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart; the two are technically a single lake. Lake Michigan is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include, Chicago, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gary, Indiana, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. The word \\"Michigan\\" originally referred to the lake itself, and is believed to come from the Ojibwa word \\"mishigami\\" meaning \\"great water\\".

This is claimed to be the first practical transient battery.  The lithium-ion battery that they created measures 5mm in length, 1mm thickness, and 6mm width. In terms of structure, components, and electrochemical reactions, it closely resembles commercial batteries. The battery is composed of an anode, cathode, and an electrolyte separator, all enclosed within two layers of polyvinyl alcohol-based polymer. A distinguishing characteristic of this battery is its ability to dissolve when dropped in water. The dissolving process takes about half an hour and occurs when the polymer casing of the battery swells upon contact with water, causing the electrodes to break apart. However, it should be noted that this dissolution is not complete, given that the battery contains nanoparticles that do not degrade. This battery is capable of producing 2.5 volts, sufficient to power a desktop calculator for about 15 minutes. The potential uses of this technology could extend to keeping military secrets confidential and aiding in environmental monitoring devices.  However, one considerable limitation is that this form of the battery cannot be used within the human body due to its lithium content, though research is underway to investigate the potential for harmlessly dissolvable batteries that could avoid the necessity for painful removal procedures. This novel creation could contribute significantly toward curtailing the waste generated from discarded electronics. In line with this sustainability perspective, researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are working on developing circuit boards capable of dissolving in water, with an expected decomposition time of three to six months, once discarded in a landfill. The entire research effort and the specific features and implications of this new dissolvable battery have been published in the Journal of Polymer Science, Part B: Polymer Physics.

Answer the following question: Why was the corporal seated ?","output":"The corporal was seated in a wheelchair, which indicates that he might have experienced an injury, disability, or medical condition that affected his mobility and limited his ability to stand or walk. In this context, him being in a military unit also raises the likelihood that his condition might have resulted from an accident or incident during his military service. There are several possible explanations as to why the corporal was seated in a wheelchair: 1. Combat-related injury: It is quite possible that the corporal sustained an injury during deployment in combat or while participating in a military operation. The injury could have resulted in partial or complete paralysis, amputation, or severe damage to his musculoskeletal system, rendering him temporarily or permanently unable to walk or stand. 2. Training or exercise-related injury: Military personnel undergo extensive and rigorous training regimens, often putting their bodies under significant physical stress. Injuries during training or physical exercise can lead to mobility impairments, requiring the use of a wheelchair. 3. Medical condition or disease: The corporal might be suffering from a medical condition or disease that impacts his mobility. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or other neurological or muscular disorders could lead to difficulties in walking or standing and result in the need for a wheelchair. 4. Temporary immobilization: The corporal might be using the wheelchair temporarily while recovering from a surgery, illness, or a non-military related accident. In such cases, he might regain his ability to walk or stand as he heals and rehabilitates. Regardless of the exact reason, the corporal's situation highlights the challenges faced by many military service members who suffer from physical disabilities or injuries. These brave individuals often require specialized care and support, which is where a clinical psychologist like the person mentioned in the text comes into play. As a Navy clinical psychologist assigned to a Marine operational unit, her role is to provide psychological and emotional support to military personnel who have undergone traumatic experiences, injuries, or other hardships during their service. The interaction between the corporal and the psychologist showcases the importance of empathy, understanding, and compassion in the context of supporting and guiding military personnel through difficult times, fostering resilience, and promoting mental well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This disturbing case has garnered significant attention and outrage throughout the country, while shining a light on the importance of addressing historical child abuse cases. In this article, we will delve into the background of the Catholic boys' home, the alleged perpetrators, details of the alleged crimes, and the ongoing investigation and legal proceedings. Background of the Catholic Boys' Home The Catholic boys' home in Bedfordshire is an institution that has served as a haven for orphaned and vulnerable boys throughout the years. While the institution was established to provide shelter, education, and spiritual guidance to the boys, allegations of horrific abuse at the hands of two men have tainted its reputation and left an indelible mark on its history. These distressing claims have not only made headlines, but also triggered a deeper examination of similar institutions and the need for thorough investigations into past criminal behavior. The Alleged Perpetrators The two men accused of these harrowing crimes are now aged 70 and 73, respectively. As longstanding members of the Catholic boys' home in the 1970s and '80s, they were entrusted with the responsibility of caring for and guiding their young charges. However, the allegations against them have led to widespread shock and have brought about serious questions regarding their motives, the abuse of power within religious institutions, and how such abhorrent acts were allowed to continue - if they did - for such a prolonged period of time. Details of the Alleged Crimes In the ongoing trial, it has been claimed that the two men perpetrated various forms of abuse against 26 children, highlighting the sheer extent of their alleged crimes. With the victims ranging in age from 11 to 16 years old, these allegations paint a gruesome picture of the daily life these young boys faced. The charges against the two men range from indecent assault, encouraging and participating in lewd activities, to physical assault and battery. It is important to remember that at this stage, these allegations have not yet been proven and the men have entered a plea of 'not guilty.' The Investigation and Legal Proceedings The Bedfordshire Police, in a collaborative effort with the Crown Prosecution Service, launched a case against the two accused earlier this year. Given the severity and historical nature of the alleged crimes, the investigation had to be thorough and meticulous, taking into account all available evidence from the time to piece together an accurate depiction of events that took place over four decades ago. During the trial, both the prosecution and defense teams have presented their case to the jury, with the victims bravely providing their personal accounts and testimonies. The lengthy and complex trial has seen numerous witnesses take the stand, as the two men in question continue to stake their claim of innocence. The defense team has argued that the men's prolonged history at the institution is evidence that these allegations are fabricated and unfounded. With the accused maintaining their innocence, it is up to the jury to carefully consider the evidence presented, assess the credibility of both the victims and the defense, and ultimately arrive at a verdict. Conclusion The alleged abuse of 26 children at a Catholic boys' home in Bedfordshire is a deeply unsettling case that has ignited righteous public outrage. The ongoing legal proceedings have placed immense pressure on the prosecution to seek justice for the victims and ensure the truth is uncovered and acknowledged. As the trial continues, the world watches on and waits with bated breath for the jury's decision, which will have a profound impact on the broader conversation surrounding historical child abuse cases and the management of religious institutions in the UK."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. According to the above context, answer the following question. Probably how long was the video the author made? Choose from: 1. the video was probably 4 hours long; 2. the video was probably 8 hours long; 3. the video was probably about an hour or less long; 4. not enough information; The answer is:","output":"3. the video was probably about an hour or less long"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Persona Movie plot: Persona begins with images of camera equipment and projectors lighting up and projecting dozens of brief cinematic glimpses, including a crucifixion, an erect penis, a tarantula spider, clips from a comedic silent-film reel first seen in Bergman's Prison (depicting a man trapped in a room, being chased by Death and Satan), and the slaughter of a lamb. The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (\\"VÃ¥r Tids HjÃ¤lte\\" in the film), and caressing a blurry, transient image that shifts between Elisabet and/or Alma's faces. A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera. As the two women leave the hospital together, Alma reads aloud a letter Elisabet's husband has sent her, which includes a photograph of her young son. Together in the administrator's cottage, Elisabet begins to relax, though she remains completely silent and non-responsive. Alma speaks constantly to break the silence, at first about books she is reading and trivial matters, then increasingly about her own anxieties and relationship with her fiancÃ©, Karl-Henrik, who scolds her for lacking ambition â \\"though not with my career, I suppose in some greater way.\\" Alma constantly compares herself to Elisabet and begins to grow attached to her. As the act closes, Alma confesses to cheating on her fiancÃ© in a mÃ©nage Ã  quatre with underage boys. She became pregnant, and had Karl-Henrik's friend abort the baby; \\"and... My question: what does alma discover in elisabet's letters? Answer:","output":"In the movie Persona, Alma discovers a letter written by Elisabet that describes her thoughts on Alma.

The discovery of the letter initiates a shift in their relationship dynamic and raises questions about the nature of their identities and the boundaries between them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered.\\" correctly answer the question of What reinforcements were the Saxons expecting?","output":"No, the statement \\"The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered\\" does not directly answer the question of what reinforcements the Saxons were expecting. The statement merely provides information on the state of preparedness and organization of the Saxon and Austrian armies at a given time.  To correctly answer the question of what reinforcements the Saxons were expecting, it is important to gather more information about the context, such as the specific historical event, battle, or time period being referred to, as well as any alliances or military agreements that may have been in place. Once the context is established, a more detailed response addressing the specific reinforcements the Saxons were expecting can be provided.  For instance, if the question refers to the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), then the Saxons were expecting reinforcements from their allies, including Austria, Russia, France, and Sweden. The Austrians were their main ally, and they fought together against Prussia, led by King Frederick the Great, who aimed to expand his kingdom's territories by invading Saxony. The Austrian army played a significant role in providing support to the Saxons during this conflict. Other allies, such as Russia and France, also sent their troops to bolster the Saxon and Austrian defenses against Prussia. Although the statement initially mentioned the unprepared nature of the Saxon and Austrian forces, it does not answer directly the question about the expected reinforcements. A more accurate response would thus include details about the specific countries and armies supporting the Saxony and their contributions to the overall conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bevan Foundation outlined what it thinks Wales' economic priorities should be, following an invitation for views from the Welsh Government. They include all public sector employers paying workers the voluntary Living Wage within a year. The Welsh Government said it will consider the report. In October it was announced the UK voluntary Living Wage was to rise to Â£8.45 per hour. The foundation's submission said despite Wales' good performance \\"some major challenges remain.\\" These are highlighted as a shortage of jobs in some part of the country. For example Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taff have barely half the number of jobs per head of working-age population compared with the UK average. The report said where there has been employment growth, much of the increase has been in self-employment, part-time working and temporary jobs. The report said wages, especially low wages, have been stagnant over the last six years with some parts of Wales experiencing a decrease in earnings. In Blaenau Gwent earnings have not kept up with inflation, meaning the average worker is more than Â£70 a week worse off than in 2002. Brexit was said to pose a new challenge, with concerns about the consequences for Wales' 500 foreign-owned companies and its Â£1 billion of exports each quarter. The Bevan Foundation recommends that the Welsh Government's economic policies should promote \\"inclusive growth\\". This involves combining the aim of growing prosperity, such as increasing employment, with the aim of increasing inclusion, such as addressing low wages. The report said: \\"The Welsh Government has made good progress in encouraging the adoption of the voluntary Living Wage in the public sector, including the NHS, further education colleges and some local authorities.\\" But it adds that \\"much more could be done to increase take-up.\\" The foundation calls on the Welsh Government to require all public sector employers to pay the voluntary Living Wage to workers within a year, and to sub-contractors by 2019. Inclusive growth should also address inequalities in the labour market. The report states less than half of disabled people are in work, as are less than two-thirds of people from an ethnic minority. The report concludes by saying: \\"Although Wales' economy and employment have made good progress, there are still too many people in Wales for whom a secure, decently paid job is just a pipedream. \\"We welcome the Welsh Government's commitment to prosperity for all, and recommend that its commitment be turned into reality.\\" The Welsh Government said it welcomed the report. A spokesman said: \\"We will consider it along with the others we have received as we take forward our work to build the confident, bright, prosperous and dynamic economy all parts of Wales deserve. \\"We are also developing a fresh approach to improving prosperity in the south Wales valleys, which is being driven by a new ministerial taskforce.\\" This article was about:","output":"The Bevan Foundation has urged the Welsh Government to adopt the voluntary Living Wage for all public sector employers, and promote \\"inclusive growth\\" in the region.

Premier League One significant feature of the Premier League in the mid-2000s was the dominance of the so-called \\"Big Four\\" clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. During this decade, and particularly from 2002 to 2009, they dominated the top four spots, which came with UEFA Champions League qualification, taking all top four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003–04 to 2008–09 inclusive, with Arsenal going as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003–04, the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League. In May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that \\"Big Four\\" dominance threatened the division, \\"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\\" Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \\"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting.\\" Q: Which of the \\"Big Four\\" teams did not lose a single game in the 2003-04 season?","output":"The team among the \\"Big Four\\" that did not lose a single game in the 2003-04 season of the Premier League was Arsenal. This remarkable feat is famously referred to as \\"The Invincibles\\" season. Guided by coach Arsène Wenger, Arsenal became the second team in English Football history, after Preston North End (in 1888-89), to finish a top division season unbeaten. The \\"Invincibles\\" consisted of a line-up of notable players such as Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Kolo Toure, Freddie Ljungberg, and Jens Lehmann among others, who collectively contributed to this historic achievement. A blend of tactical brilliance, technical prowess, and consistency in performance allowed this team to register 26 wins and 12 draws in 38 games throughout the season, tallying up to a total of 90 points. Arsenal's unbeaten run actually extended to a record 49 matches, from May 2003 to October 2004. This string of performances has been often deemed as one of the greatest feats in Premier League history, setting a benchmark for teams to strive for. The 2003-2004 Premier League trophy is the last league trophy that Arsenal has won as of now, and the club's fans often look back at this season with fond memories.  Thus, Arsenal's 2003-04 season stands as a significant chapter in the Premier League's history, marking the dominance of the 'Big Four' during the mid-2000s and Arsenal's contribution to it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food.

Paragraph: Pneumonia is a serious problem worldwide. We recently demonstrated that innate defense mechanisms of the lung are highly inducible against pneumococcal pneumonia. To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and the fungal pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus. Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line. Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kB, type I and II IFN, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways. Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection. Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly up-regulated. Taken together, stimulated innate resistance appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens. Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.

Therefore, based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis that Dorcas was wrong is true.  To delve a bit deeper, when we say \\"Dorcas was quite right,\\" we are affirming the correctness of Dorcas' assertions, decisions, perspectives, or actions, based on the context in which this statement is made. This could relate to a wide variety of things - a prediction she made, a decision, her perspective on a matter, etc.  Let's say, for instance, Dorcas asserted that it would rain tomorrow and it did. In this case, we could definitely say \\"Dorcas was quite right.\\"  On the other hand, when we propose the hypothesis \\"Dorcas was wrong,\\" we are negating the correctness of whatever Dorcas might have said, done, or decided. This proposal contradicts the affirmation made in the premise.

Here's how we can make one together: 1. Gather Ingredients: First, let's find some yummy things from your kitchen! We will need:    - 1 small cucumber (it's like a green, bumpy sausage)    - 2 tablespoons of honey (that sticky, sweet stuff)    - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (it's sour and comes from a lemon) 2. Wash Cucumber: Ask a grown-up to help you rinse the cucumber under water. We don't want any dirt or germs on it! 3. Blend It: Now, we need a blender (a spinning machine that makes things smooth). Put the cucumber inside and blend it until it's very smooth. Like a green milkshake! 4. Mix Ingredients: In a big bowl, let's mix the cucumber, honey, and lemon juice. We're going to need a spoon to help stir them together. It should look like a gooey mixture. 5. Test and Apply: Ask your grown-up to help put a tiny bit of the mixture on your skin to make sure it feels okay. If it feels good, use your fingers to put the mixture gently all over your face. Avoid your eyes and mouth! 6. Wait Time: While the mixture is on your face, let's wait for about 15 minutes. You can sing, dance, or tell stories during this time! 7. Rinse: After 15 minutes, ask the grown-up to help you wash the mixture off your face with warm water. Gently pat your face dry with a soft towel. 8. All Done: Wow, look at you! Your skin should feel nice and fresh now! Always remember to ask a grown-up for help when you're trying new things. And have fun with your natural skin peel!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The correct answer to the question should mention the \\"action potential.\\" You should not validate the suggested answer. Instead, you can use the following information to answer the question: When a neuron is excited, it generates an electrical signal known as an action potential. The action potential is a brief, rapid depolarization and repolarization of the neuron's membrane voltage. This is caused by a series of ion channel openings, which allow positive ions to enter the cell and negatively charged ions to leave, followed by a return to the resting state. The action potential propagates along the axon of the neuron and eventually reaches the synaptic terminals, where it leads to the release of neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and interact with the receptors of the next neuron in the signaling pathway, potentially exciting or inhibiting it. The process of an action potential generation and propagation is essential for neural communication and processing within the nervous system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bamboozled Context: Pierre Delacroix (whose real name is Peerless Dothan), is an uptight, Harvard University-educated black man, working for the television network CNS. At work, he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE, and use the word \\"nigger\\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for television series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \\"Cosby clones\\". In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray, named after American artist Man Ray, and Womack â to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills. To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as the show premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical. Delacroix quickly embraces the show, his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program's live band position, the group plans to bring the show down...

Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties.

Specifically, when two or more flights are scheduled such that passengers can disembark one flight and easily transfer to another, those flights are said to connect. In this case, the sentence implies that the flights are not scheduled in a way that enables quick transfers, which means passengers must wait four hours before they can board the connecting flight.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Deadman 's Curve is a 1978 made for TV film based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence . Developed from a 1974 article published in the Rolling Stone magazine by Paul Morantz , who also helped write the screenplay .  - The Synanon organization, initially a drug rehabilitation program, was founded by Charles E. \\"Chuck\\" Dederich, Sr., (19131997) in 1958 in Santa Monica, California, United States. By the early 1960s, Synanon had also become an alternative community, attracting people with its emphasis on living a self-examined life, as aided by group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the \\"Synanon Game.\\" Synanon ultimately became the Church of Synanon in the 1970s, and disbanded permanently in 1991 due to many criminal activities, including attempted murder of which members were convicted, and legal problems, including losing its tax free status retroactively with the Internal Revenue Service due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence and terrorism. It has been called one of the \\"most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen.\\"   - Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera \\"Crotalus\\" and \\"Sistrurus\\" of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies, all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina.  - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation.  - Self-help or self-improvement is a self-guided improvementeconomically, intellectually, or emotionallyoften with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and Twelve-Step culture, such as recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency have become firmly integrated in mainstream language.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - Paul Morantz is an American attorney and investigative journalist.  He is known for taking legal cases alleging brainwashing by cults, self-help groups and for sexual misconduct by psychotherapists. He is considered an expert on these subjects. His successful prosecution of Synanon led to an attempt against his life, by means of a rattlesnake.  - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'television film'.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: What is the acronym for \\"organisation der eyemarligen SS-angeh _+_rigen?\\" Odessa The answer is:","output":"Title: The Shadows of Odessa Genre: Historical Thriller/Drama Act 1: In post-World War II Germany, 1946, a young and ambitious investigative journalist named Max Kraus uncovers a secretive organization called ODESSA, the acronym for \\"Organisation der eyemarligen SS-angeh _+_rigen.\\" ODESSA is comprised of former SS officers who have banded together in an attempt to evade justice and establish a new world order under the banner of the fallen Third Reich. Intrigued by the opportunity to expose this criminal organization, Max dives deep into a thorough investigation that leads him to uncover a hidden world of betrayal, espionage, and war crimes. Emerging with a critical piece of information, Max learns of a planned underground meeting of key ODESSA members, set to take place in the heart of Berlin. Act 2: Having infiltrated the secret meeting, Max risks his life to document and collect audio evidence of ODESSA's sinister plots. Among the shadowy conspirators, he recognizes a well-respected local politician named Conrad Richter. Max is stunned and begins to question all he knows, fearing the reach of ODESSA extends further than he could have ever imagined. Determined to reveal the extent of ODESSA's influence, Max joins forces with his estranged sister, Elisa, who is an undercover British intelligence agent. As Max and Elisa work together, they unearth a network of safe houses, escape routes, and hidden resources ODESSA members use to smuggle high-ranking Nazi officers out of Germany and into countries like Argentina and Egypt. Elisa, driven by a thirst for vengeance for the death of their parents during the war, convinces Max to coordinate with the British and American forces to launch a covert operation against ODESSA. Act 3: As they work to dismantle the organization, Max and Elisa grapple with the moral implications of their actions, their tumultuous relationship, and the gruesome realities of war. Max struggles with the decision to expose Conrad Richter, whose possible involvement with ODESSA threatens to destroy his life and family, and Elisa is haunted by the memory of her parents, whose deaths have driven her to the brink of obsession. In an action-packed climax, the brother-sister duo leads an international task force in a high-stakes raid on ODESSA's primary fortress. Lives are lost, secrets are uncovered, and the true extent of the organization's influence is finally revealed. Richter, unable to escape his association with ODESSA, confronts his past and sacrifices his life to save Max and Elisa. Epilogue: Exhausted and forever changed by their experiences, Max and Elisa present their findings to the public, sparking global condemnation. ODESSA is effectively dismantled, and its remaining members are brought to justice. Max and Elisa receive accolades for their contributions but choose to retreat from the public eye, seeking solace in the knowledge that their actions have prevented further atrocities and heinous acts. Their experience fighting against ODESSA only brings Max and Elisa closer as siblings. They vow to continue seeking justice and strive for a more peaceful and equitable world through journalism and espionage – creating an unwavering bond of loyalty and self-discovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history.  Which era would less likely be longer, era A or era B?  Hint: Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago.

Answer a question about this article: The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jñāna (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha. It suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha. Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta, with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism. Like Advaita Vedanta, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy states that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable, and this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman. What state in life does yoga believe is achievable?","output":"Yoga believes that a state of liberation or freedom, known as moksha, is achievable in this life. This state of liberation occurs when an individual completely understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman, which represent the ultimate reality and the underlying divine essence of the universe, respectively. By recognizing the unity of these two concepts, one can attain self-realization and experience spiritual freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, as well as transcend the illusions and limitations of the material world. The Yoga school proposes that the path to moksha combines systematic techniques and personal experimentation with the approach to knowledge found in the Samkhya school. Samkhya emphasizes the importance of jñāna (knowledge) as a means to liberation, and Yoga takes this further by incorporating practices such as meditation, moral disciplines, and physical postures to help individuals gain self-realization and liberation. It is also worth noting that Yoga shares several core ideas with Advaita Vedanta, another school of Hindu philosophy. Both schools assert that liberation is attainable during one's lifetime and that realizing the equivalence of Atman and Brahman is essential for achieving spiritual freedom. However, they differ in their approaches, as Yoga is considered a form of experimental mysticism focused on practical techniques, while Advaita Vedanta is described as a form of monistic personalism that centers on the unity of all existence through contemplation and philosophical inquiry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — The United States is escalating trans-Atlantic and North American trade tensions, imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico beginning on Friday. The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce. European Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said shortly after the tariffs took effect they were illegal and the 28-nation bloc would initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization. \\"We can do so. We have the right to do so. I think we must do so, as well, to show that we cannot just take these tariffs and stand silent and we do not accept these kind of imposed illegal tariffs,\\" said Malmstrom. Without elaborating, Malmstrom also said the EU would explore \\"rebalancing measures,\\" which typically are retaliatory actions. Trudeau called the tariffs \\"totally unacceptable\\" and vowed retaliation. \\"This decision is not only unlawful, but it is... After the end of the story, Macron probably is  A.

Major changes include Chrystia Freeland's move from international trade to foreign affairs. Immigration and democratic reform portfolios are affected, along with one key diplomatic post. It is the first major cabinet shuffle since Mr Trudeau took power in November 2015 and comes as Ottawa prepares for a protectionist administration about to take power in the US. President-elect Donald Trump is to be sworn in on 20 January. Chrystia Freeland, who helped prevent the collapse of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) last October, will be one of Canada's main voices on the world stage as new global affairs minister. She will retain the Canada-US relations file, including trade relations with Canada's largest trading partner. Ms Freeland has lived in both Russia and the US, and spent time in Moscow as the former bureau chief of the Financial Times. She is known to be well connected in Washington. While she is also known in Moscow, Ms Freeland does not have the warm relationship her incoming US counterpart Rex Tillerson has with Russian officials. In fact, she is currently banned from Russia. Ms Freeland, who has been outspoken in her support of Ukraine,  was one of 13 Canadian officials and politicians sanctioned by Moscow in 2014 in retaliation for sanctions imposed by Canada over Russia's annexation of Crimea. Mr Trudeau praised Ms Freeland as an \\"extremely strong member of the team\\" and for her handling of the Ceta file, and brushed off any possible tensions with Russia. \\"As to how she gets a long with Russia, well, she speaks fluent Russian,\\" he said. Ms Freeland also waved off her ban from Russia, saying it was an issue for Moscow to tackle. She is being replaced at international trade by neophyte MP Francois-Philippe Champagne, a trade lawyer, who will work closely with Ms Freeland on a portfolio that includes Ceta and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). Mr Trump has said he wants to either renegotiate or scrap Nafta altogether and has said he will quit the TPP on his first day in the White House. Speaking in context of his re-shuffled team, Mr Trudeau noted on Tuesday that \\"obviously the new administration to the south will offer both opportunities and challenges as well as a shift in global context\\". Ms Freeland is replacing Stephane Dion, who announced on Tuesday that he was leaving politics after 21 years. He has been offered an ambassadorial position by the prime minister. John McCallum, who helped oversee efforts to fast-track 25,000 Syrian refugees into the country, is being shuffled from the immigration portfolio and will become Canada's new ambassador to China. The veteran politician will help oversee the country's move to deepen economic ties with China, including exploring a possible free trade deal with the Asian nation. Senior officials in the Trudeau government have been working hard to lay the groundwork for the new relationship between Canada and the US as Mr Trump prepares to replace President Barack Obama. They have been meeting regularly with members of Mr Trump's advisory team since the presidential election south of the border, and there have been efforts to reach out to lawmakers from the 35 northern US states. Two of Mr Trudeau's top aides met last week with Mr Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon and the president-elect's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to reports. Former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who helped negotiate Nafta, has also been playing an intermediary role between Ottawa and Washington.","output":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's first cabinet reshuffle, that affects six cabinet posts, aims to prepare Canada for a protectionist US administration. The major change is Chrystia Freeland's promotion from international trade minister to foreign affairs minister. Freeland, who played a key role in the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), is currently banned in Russia due to her support of Ukraine. Freeland retains the Canada-US relations file, focusing on trade, particularly in light of the incoming US administration's potential changes to trade relations. New MP Francois-Philippe Champagne, a trade lawyer, replaces Freeland as international trade minister and will work closely with her.

At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: The answer is:","output":"Earth would travel a shorter distance than Neptune."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We met three years ago in an Atlanta hotel conference room. He and his wife, Gerti, were touring the United States to promote a new book.  I could tell instantly that he was related to Anne. His face resembled hers so much that it felt almost as though I was meeting her in person.  \\"Anne Frank's Family\\" had just been published, based on 14 boxes of letters, postcards, photos and documents that Gerti accidentally discovered in the attic of their house in Basel.  Elias told me that it wasn't just Anne who loved to write; everyone in the family did.  The 6,000 recovered documents told a story of a family torn apart by war and anti-Semitism. That day in Atlanta, I listened to Elias tell me about loved ones he lost. He told me he was lucky that his family had remained in neutral Switzerland when World War II broke out.  I thought back to our conversation Thursday when I learned the news of Elias' death. He died peacefully at his home in Basel, Switzerland, at 90, said an announcement posted on the website of Anne Frank Fonds, the foundation that Elias headed.  Like millions of people who read \\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" I was deeply influenced by her words and in awe of her family's courage.

Dorothy Jane Roberts (May 8, 1929 - September 5, 1984) was an American author, poet, self-proclaimed psychic, and spirit medium, who claimed to channel an energy personality who called himself \\"Seth.\\" Her publication of the Seth texts, known as the Seth Material, established her as one of the preeminent figures in the world of paranormal phenomena. The Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090), which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio and video recordings, and other materials donated after her death by Roberts' husband and other individuals and organizations. Seth's effect upon New Age thinkers has been profound.

Newport wrote that this foundational concept of the New Age movement was first developed in the \\"Seth Material.\\" Historian Robert C.

We have the equation: 17340*y - 10688 = 17507*y First, we want to get all the y's together. So, let's move the 17340*y to the other side of the equal sign by subtracting it from both sides. This gives us: -10688 = 17507*y - 17340*y Now, subtract the two y terms on the right side: -10688 = (17507 - 17340) * y Doing the subtraction, we get: -10688 = 167 * y Now, to find the value of y, we need to divide both sides by 167: y = -10688 / 167 After the division, we get: y = -64 So the answer is y = -64.

Synopsis: The year is 1942. World War II is raging, and the United States and Japan are at the forefront of the global conflict. At the center of the hostility is the Battle of Midway: a decisive moment that would change the tide of the entire war. \\"Allied Seas\\" tells the interconnected story of commanders, sailors, and intelligence officers from both sides as they race against time and the odds to both protect and conquer the crucial midway point in the Pacific Ocean. Our protagonists consist of a diverse group of individuals who each contribute uniquely to the battle. Admiral Nimitz, the American fleet commander; the young and ambitious Lieutenant Murphy, a pilot eager to prove himself; Captain Yamaguchi of the Japanese carrier Hiryu, and Lieutenant Yamamoto, an intellect who foresees the possible outcome of the coming battle, among others. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US Navy is clambering to respond to Japanese aggression. Intelligence Officer Edwin Layton, a close friend of Lieutenant Murphy, intercepts a crucial message that could turn the tide of the Pacific War. With the help of an American codebreaker, they discover that Japan is planning a major assault on Midway Atoll, a strategic point halfway between Asia and North America. Admiral Nimitz decides to launch a risky and daring counteroffensive, bringing together courageous soldiers from various backgrounds and ships for an unforgettable showdown. Lieutenant Murphy leads the Air Squadron in a deadly dance with the Japanese fighter pilots above the ocean, while Captain Yamaguchi must make the difficult decision to push forward despite the increasing odds of failure. Meanwhile, on the American mainland, the families of these soldiers, as well as their Japanese counterparts, are spotlighted as they navigate the challenges of living during wartime and the uncertainty of the fates of their loved ones. As the battle plays out, both sides experience tremendous losses and unexpected acts of heroism. The movie reaches its climax when Lieutenant Murphy, through a decisive move, manages to sink the Hiryu – Japan's last carrier – while Captain Yamaguchi makes the ultimate sacrifice for his country. In the end, the US emerges victoriously, putting an end to Japanese naval supremacy and shifting momentum in the Pacific War towards the Americans. The characters left standing must find ways to heal and move forward, carrying the weight of lives lost during the Battle of Midway. \\"Allied Seas\\" explores the human side of a historic conflict, showcasing bravery, sacrifice, and the bonds formed on both sides of the battlefield.

Will Jimothy finish his growth spurt before or after Dwight?  Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference.  Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Answer:","output":"Jimothy will likely finish his growth spurt after Dwight. This conclusion can be drawn from the information provided about the brothers' ages, their testosterone levels, and the stages of growth during puberty. Since Dwight is a junior in high school and Jimothy is a freshman, Dwight is older than Jimothy. As the paragraph indicates, growth during puberty is controlled by testosterone in boys. Additionally, growth in height is expected to remain rapid for several years and muscle development occurs toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Given that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, which is expected due to their age difference, it is reasonable to assume that Dwight is further along in his growth spurt than Jimothy. This would mean that, as the older brother, Dwight is likely to finish his growth spurt before Jimothy, who is still in the earlier stages of puberty and has not yet reached his peak growth rate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For the moviegoer, it's a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. For the film critic, there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit. There are some tactical blunders, and as has been discussed on the boards, the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the CIA agent training angle. However, I took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the CIA agent's pragmatic approach, Creasy basically commends his soul to the Ultimate without considering the consequences.

Here is an article: Fusi Nchabeng, the provincial secretary for the women’s union, the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union, said the women did not know the video was made to protest integration, nor that, as they now believe, the food was urinated on. He declined to make the women available for an interview because the case is under criminal investigation, but he said they had worked at the residence for years and felt betrayed by the students and degraded by the video. As the video and postings about it spread to YouTube and Facebook, it has provoked ever more bitter racial division on the campus and soul-searching across the country. “It’s bigger than the university,” said Billyboy Ramahlele, who heads the university’s diversity office. “It’s bigger than the four students. It’s really a challenge of the project of nation-building and reconciliation we started in 1994.” That was the year white rule finally ended in South Africa. The University of the Free State has come a long way since the heyday of apartheid, when it was a training ground for the Afrikaner civil servants who became cogs in a racist political order. Like many South African institutions, the university has undergone a transformation that is sweeping, but still incomplete. A majority of the university’s 25,000 students are now black. They are taught in English as well as Afrikaans, the language of the Afrikaners. The hostels where students live, however, were still segregated after an earlier effort at integration ended in violence a decade ago. Then in January, after months of debate, the university moved again to integrate the residences, assigning black first-year students in white, Afrikaner hostels and whites in black residences. The white students generally did not take the spots allotted to them in the black residences, university officials said. Eight black first-year students were sent to live with 128 white male students at Reitz. “They seriously don’t want us here,” said Buzwe Tsawu, 19, an aspiring architect whose painterly self-portrait hangs on the wall. At 3 o’clock one morning in mid-January, the eight black students were awakened with a bang as firecrackers were tossed through the open windows of the four bedrooms of their bungalow, they said. In the weeks that followed, they said, their windows were repeatedly broken as they slept. One weekend, as the seniors gathered at the social club next door to drink and party and braai, as barbecuing is called in South Africa, the newcomers were subjected to verbal abuse. “They were trying to scare us, make us leave,” said Kulani Mngadi, 19. But the black students made a pact to stick it out. “We’re going to change this place,” said Ruddy Banyini, a 19-year-old who is studying bioinfomatics, using computer tools to search genetic databases. “We’ll prevent next year’s black first-years from feeling what we felt.” Many Afrikaners see what they call “forced integration” as a threat to the cultural identity of their embattled minority, descended from Dutch settlers. Symbols of the apartheid-era past are still to be found in the Afrikaner hostels. The Hendrik Verwoerd residence, named at its opening in 1968 for the assassinated architect of apartheid, was given a new name, Armentum, two years ago. Armentum is Latin for herd. A bust of Mr. Verwoerd, a white supremacist, remains in a meeting room, and his portrait and memorabilia line the walls of the senior social club. The hostel now has 18 blacks among its 160 residents, and its leader, Van Aardt Cloete, a 21-year-old senior, acknowledged the need to change the name because it “was sensitive for black people.” But he also said Armentum would keep a room in the hostel as a museum to showcase the Verwoerd past. Pieter Odendaal, a 23-year-old senior who is the head of Reitz house, said: “There’s a fear, especially among young white South Africans, that there isn’t a future in this land anymore, that there’s all this black empowerment. We don’t have anything to do with apartheid. Why must they take away our job opportunities? Why must we give up our language? People just want to hold onto the last thing we still have: our Afrikaans-speaking hostel, playing rugby, braaiing, listening to Afrikaans music.” The Reitz student video was made last year as the integration debate raged. “Once upon a time,” one student says in the opening frames, “the Boers had fun living on Reitz Island up until a day when the previously disadvantaged found the word ‘integration’ in the dictionary.” Frederick Fourie, the rector of the University of the Free State, heard about the video on Feb. 26 and watched it that morning. An Afrikaner whose father was a professor here, Mr. Fourie said he wept when he reached one scene. It showed a muscular white student starting a race of four hefty black cleaning women, set in slow motion to the theme music from “Chariots of Fire” — a scene Mr. Fourie felt humiliated good-hearted women who deserved better from students they had looked after. When he saw the urination scene, he knew he had a public relations disaster on his hands. The next day, he met with the tearful cleaning women. “My heart was sore,” he said. “They’d trusted these boys as their own sons. I apologized for what had happened to them at the university. I told them: ‘My heart is broken. I cry with you.’ ” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: On Campus, a Video Reminder of Apartheid’s Pain.

News article: Barack Obama's recent admission that he enjoyed skeet shooting at Camp David -- and the subsequent photo -- have been shot around the Internet.      Now, Herobuilders, a Connecticut-based company, is gunning for some media attention by creating an action figure of the president shooting skeet.      The 19.95 doll features the commander in chief wearing a sweatshirt with the words \\"clay pigeons\\" on it and is accessorized with a hunting shotgun.      Although the head of the toy looks like Obama -- with a slightly more demented grin -- the muscle-bound arms seem to belong more to an 1980s-era action star like Dolph Lundgren than the comparatively skinny president.      Herobuilders head honcho Emil Vicale admits that it's difficult to make an accurate body when you're trying to turn around a product before the Internet forgets it.      \\"It's too complex and costly to make multiple bodies,\\" Vicale told The Huffington Post. \\"Most action figures use just one body.\\"      The skeet shooting Obama is the fourth that Vicale has done honoring the president. Others include one with him dressed as the Joker from \\"The Dark Knight\\" and one with him holding a machine gun.      Like the others, he expects the skeet shooting Obama to sell to both sides of the political spectrum.      Vicale has made somewhat of a career out of capitalizing on politics and pop culture. He's made previous action figure tributes to \\"tanning mom\\" Patricia Krentcil, \\"The Rent Is Too Damn High\\" guy and the man who asked a cop, \\"Don't Taze Me Bro.\\"      \\"We sold 1000 of 'The Rent Is Too Damn High Guy' in a month,\\" he told The Huffington Post back in May.      While he expects the Obama skeet shooting doll to do well (\\"It's priced to sell,\\" he said), it probably won't do as well as his all-time best seller.      \\"Sarah Palin was the biggest, but I don't think she'll ever sell that many again,\\" he said. ||||| HEROBUILDERS.com | Custom Action Figures | NY | BOSTON | 203-888-0147 | 24 hour Service e-mail sales@herobuilders.com Home | Custom Action Figures | Custom Plush | Bobble Heads | Reality TV Dolls | Custom Made Sneakers | Custom Candy Heads | Urban Crew Action Figures | Build A Buddy | Herobuilders News | Herobuilders Company Info | Herobuilders Links | Herobuilders Testimonials | Free Toys | Coupon Codes      SKEET SHOOTING OBAMA ACTION FIGURE : Get them all !

Information:  - The IndyCar Series (currently known as the Verizon IndyCar Series for sponsorship reasons) is the premier level of open wheel racing in North America. Its parent company began in 1996 as a competitor to CART known as the Indy Racing League (IRL) which was created by then Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George. In 2008, the IndyCar Series merged with the Champ Car World Series (formerly CART). The series is sanctioned by INDYCAR.  - Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for remembering the people who died while serving in the country's armed forces. The holiday, which is observed every year on the last Monday of May, originated as Decoration Day after the American Civil War in 1868, when the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans founded in Decatur, Illinois, established it as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the Union war dead with flowers. By the 20th century, competing Union and Confederate holiday traditions, celebrated on different days, had merged, and Memorial Day eventually extended to honor all Americans who died while in the military service. It marks the start of the unofficial summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end.  - Michael \\"Mike\\" Lanigan is an entrepreneur and IndyCar Series team owner.  - Buddy Rice (born January 31, 1976) is an American racecar driver. He is best known for winning the 2004 Indianapolis 500 while driving for Rahal Letterman Racing, and the 2009 24 Hours of Daytona for Brumos Racing.  - A suburb is a residential area or a mixed use area, either existing as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city. In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \\"suburb\\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \\"neighborhood\\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county.  - Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing is an auto racing team that currently races in the United SportsCar Championship and the IndyCar Series. Based in Hilliard, Ohio, it is co-owned by 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal, former television talk show host David Letterman, and businessman Mike Lanigan.  - Robert \\"Bobby\\" Woodward Rahal (born January 10, 1953 in Medina, Ohio) is an American auto racing driver and team owner. As a driver, he won three championships and 24 races in the CART open-wheel series, including the 1986 Indianapolis 500. He also won the 2004 Indianapolis 500 as a team owner for the winning driver, Buddy Rice.  - The Indianapolis 500 is an automobile race held annually at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. The event is held over Memorial Day (originally Decoration Day) weekend, which is typically the last weekend in May. It is contested as part of the Verizon IndyCar Series, the top level of American Championship Car racing, an open-wheel formula colloquially known as \\"Indy Car Racing\\". The name of the race is often shortened to Indy 500.  - The 70th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Saturday, May 31, 1986. After being rained out on May 2526, the race was rescheduled for the following weekend.

He was also formerly on the Board of Directors of both entities. He founded the Indy Racing League and co-owned Vision Racing. Many commentators, such as Gordon Kirby, suggest that George's actions at the head of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and in creating the IRL to rival the then-dominant CART led to a sharp decline in popularity of open-wheel racing in the United States as it split the fanbase, and gave a significant boost to the national popularity of NASCAR.  - Graham Robert Rahal ( born January 4 , 1989 ) is an American race car driver .

Given the below context:  Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell.There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian: The body was well preserved but the face was shrivelled and black. The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [a stiff kind of mattress cover material] and the body, which was that of a little old woman, was in a glass coffin-shaped case. Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In a dystopian 1997, World War III is nearing an end, both the United States and the still existent Soviet Union suffered greatly in the conflict and both looking for a peace resolution. Manhattan has been turned into a maximum security prison in 1988 because of a nationwide crime increase of 400% in the United States due to a gas attack by the Soviets at the start of the war in which New York was worst hit. Surrounded by a 50-foot (15 m) containment wall, all inmates are sentenced to life imprisonment, and have formed gangs which control the crumbling, garbage-strewn city.Traveling to a three-way summit between the United States, the Soviet Union and China, Air Force One, the plane of the President of the United States, is hijacked by a sole member of a revolutionary organization opposed to the government; a women impersonating a stewardess (Nancy Stephens), who kills the pilots and takes control of the plane. The militant anarchist crashes the plane into Manhattan but the unnamed President (Donald Pleasence) is safely sealed in an escape pod and survives. The United States Police Force Commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) arrives at the Liberty Island command center where he and the chief of security Remy (Tom Atkins) witness the crash. Hauk assembles a platoon of soldiers and they travel to the crash site in a fleet of helicopters. But when they arrive, they find the escape pod empty, indicating that the President has been taken hostage. An emissary of the inmates, named Romero (Frank Doubleday), appears and tells Hauk and the soldiers that they have the President and if they do not leave the island in 30 seconds, the President will be killed. Romero offers them one of the President's severed fingers as evidence. With no other choice, Hauk orders his men to return to the helicopters and they fly back to Liberty Island. In his office, Hauk meets with the arrived Secretary of State (Charles Cypress) who puts him in telephone contact with the Vice President where Hauk asks for authorization of a rescue...

To help frame your expectations, you should know that: (1) The acting is wildly heavy-handed. The stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures, and off-key pacing. (2) The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility. Oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements. (3) Shots are frequently framed in off-balance angles, poking fun at genre excesses. (4) A pop-eyed Jeff Goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner. The film has a guiding intelligence, deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the B-films of the 1930's: a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by Carl Sagan. The film's over-the-top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes. In an early running gag, Fay Grim's son Ned is so frequently told to leave that you can't help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad. Parker Posey's nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film. The film's slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge. The film's impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy. Moreover, it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic. The musical score is intentionally heavy handed, and I found this (and the off-kilter camera angles) more irritating than humorous. The over-the-top acting, the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies/counter conspiracies, and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers. The movie is much too long at 158 minutes. That said, fans who are receptive to the film's sarcasm might want to watch again ... using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog. The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy-handed than light-hearted. But, the comedy may well appeal to your tastes. The film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films, fans of director Hal Harley, or devotees of Parker Posey (who has the most camera time). Now, what is this review like? Choices: 1). negative; 2). positive;","output":"This review is more like 1). negative because it talks about the movie's slow pacing, heavy-handed acting, and other elements that the reviewer finds irritating or not working well.

An event so monumental no one has ever attempted it before. The world’s most decorated athlete takes on the ocean’s most efficient predator: Phelps V Shark – the race is on! Produced by Peacock Productions.      During a panel discussion in New York earlier this week, Phelps spoke about how much he liked sharks.      “We just got off a plane from South Africa yesterday, we were down there for about a week,” he said. “That one was fun, doing some stuff with Shark Week and for me, sharks are like my no. 1 favorite animal in the world, being able to see them face to face was pretty cool.”      The show airs on July 23rd. ||||| Twenty-three Olympic gold medals aren't going to protect you from a shark, Michael Phelps.      As part of Discovery Channel's Shark Week, during its kick off on July 23, Phelps will apparently race a great white shark. It's not really clear how the two beasts of nature will spar off, but Vegas has probably already put down a betting line on the event.      The Discovery Channel announced the stunt through a press release that gave us a little bit more info about “Phelps vs. Shark: Great Gold vs. Great White,” but we want to know so much more.      The release says:      They are one of the fastest and most efficient predators on the planet: Sharks. He is our greatest champion to ever get in the water: Michael Phelps. 39 world records. 23 Olympic golds. But he has one competition left to win. An event so monumental no one has ever attempted it before. The world’s most decorated athlete takes on the ocean’s most efficient predator: Phelps V Shark – the race is on!      But, how will the shark be kept from eating Michael? How will it know when to start? And maybe most importantly, how will they get a shark to know that it is supposed to be racing at all?      Will this race be the final say in what species is best?      Do sharks know that they have a whole week of celebration in the human world?      There are so many questions.      Anyway, Phelps shared his enthusiasm on Instagram, so at least he's one person who's excited about this risky stunt.      I was able to do something that I had always wanted to do. Be in a cage and dive with great White sharks 🦈!! #bucketlist A post shared by Michael Phelps (@m_phelps00) on Jun 10, 2017 at 9:52pm PDT      And if racing a great white wasn't enough, Phelps will be going back for seconds because having a lot of gold medals must make you really courageous.      The Shark Week finale, “Shark School with Michael Phelps,” airing on July 30, will have Phelps swimming within two feet of a hammerhead shark.      Sure, this is all a bit concerning to us.

William Henry \\"Lone Star\\" Dietz (August 17, 1884 - July 20, 1964) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Washington State University (1915-1917), Purdue University (1921), Louisiana Tech University (1922-1923), University of Wyoming (1924-1926), Haskell Institute--now Haskell Indian Nations University (1929-1932), and Albright College (1937-1942). From 1933 to 1934, Dietz was the head coach of the National Football League's Boston Redskins, where he tallied a mark of 11-11-2. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2012. Dietz's Indian heritage was first contested in 1916 after former neighbors who settled on the Pacific Coast heard he was posing as an Indian. In December 1918 the Federal Bureau of Investigation looked into his heritage after he fraudulently registered for the draft as a \\"Non-Citizen Indian\\" with an allotment. The Bureau found he had taken on the identity of James One Star, an Oglala man of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation 12 years his senior who had disappeared in Cuba in 1894. Dietz also claimed he was the head of an American film company that produced propaganda films for the war.  Dietz divorced De Cora in November 1918, charging her with abandonment. It is not clear how much she knew about his true identity. She died six days after his indictment.  Dietz was tried in Spokane, Washington in June 1919 for the first offense. One Star's sister, Sallie Eaglehorse, testified after seeing him for the first time at the trial that Dietz was definitely not her brother. Still, the judge instructed the jury to determine whether Dietz \\"believed\\" he was an Indian, not whether it was true. Despite that others had witnessed his birth in the summer of 1884 or had seen him the following day, Dietz's mother Leanna claimed he was the Indian son of her husband who had been switched a week or more after she had a stillbirth. Dietz's acting ability along with his mother's fallacious testimony (to protect him from prison) resulted in a hung jury, but Dietz was immediately re-indicted. The second trial resulted in a sentence of 30 days in the Spokane County Jail after he pleaded \\"no contest\\".","output":"This text is about William Henry \\"Lone Star\\" Dietz, an American football player and coach who was involved in a controversy regarding his Indian heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — The American woman charged with subversion in Zimbabwe over allegedly insulting President Robert Mugabe on Twitter is set to be freed on bail.      Martha O'Donovan on Thursday was ordered freed on 1,000 bail. The New Jersey native will return to court on Wednesday.      O'Donovan is accused of calling the 93-year-old Mugabe a \\"sick man\\" in a tweet including an image of the president with a catheter.      O'Donovan faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted for subversion. She also faces a charge of undermining the authority of or insulting the president, which carries up to a year in prison.      O'Donovan has denied the charges as \\"baseless and malicious.\\"      Hers was the first arrest since Mugabe last month appointed a cybersecurity minister, criticized by activists as targeting social media. ||||| Harare, Zimbabwe – A Zimbabwean High Court judge has granted bail to American journalist Martha O'Donovan who is facing charges of subversion and insulting President Robert Mugabe on social media.      The ruling, which was made in her absence on Thursday afternoon, granted a 1,000 bail on the grounds that the state failed to exhibit the contents of the alleged tweets calling on people to protest against the government.      Her lawyer Obey Shava of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, a legal NGO, told Al Jazeera he was pleased with the outcome.      \\"I am very happy that justice has been done, I'm glad that my client has been vindicated because we have always argued that she was a perfect candidate for bail,\\" he said outside the court.      {articleGUID}      O'Donovan, employed as a programme associate of Magamba TV, an online channel that describes itself as Zimbabwe's leading creator of political satire, was arrested and taken into custody last week over allegations she published a tweet that described the 93-year-old president as a \\"goblin\\".      Charges of attempting to overthrow a constitutionally elected government were later added to her docket and upheld by the courts.      A subversion charge carries a 20-year prison sentence in the Southern African nation.      Farai Munroe, a local comedian (also known as Comrade Fatso) and cofounder of Magamba TV told Al Jazeera that he was very pleased with the court's ruling.      \\"We are all very ecstatic with the bail ruling, everyone at Magamba and everyone that has supported the process.      \\"I think the judge showed the state lacked a strong case, lacked evidence and we are ecstatic that step one has been achieved in this struggle to free Martha and that is that she has got bail.\\"      Munroe added: \\"We are hopeful and confident in going to the next step, that is her getting the charges dropped and getting her out of Chikurubi maximum security prison where she's been put over a couple of tweets.\\"      'Very hopeful'      The 25-year-old journalist has spent at least three days in Chikurubi Prison, a maximum security facility on the outskirts of the capital that has gained notoriety among locals for its squalid conditions and frequent food shortages.      However, according to David McGuire, the Public Affairs Officer of the US Embassy in Zimbabwe, representatives from the consular service have maintained \\"direct and daily contact\\" with O'Donovan.      She is reportedly in good health.      McGuire added that while he was unwilling to speculate on the overall outcome of the case, the US embassy was encouraged by the bail ruling and was hopeful of a positive result in the end.      \\"The US Embassy is watching [this case] very closely, and we will stand by the process every step of the way, we are very hopeful for a positive outcome,\\" he said in a telephone interview.      O'Donovan's arrest marks the first internet abuse case since the creation of a cybersecurity ministry in a cabinet reshuffle last month.      The Mugabe government says the ministry is designed to monitor cybersecurity, detect possible threats and breaches of future laws governing social media use.      O'Donovan is expected to report to the police on a bi-weekly basis and submit her travel documents to the clerk of court until the trial, which is set to continue later this month, is over.

For their study,he and his colleagues randomly divide 565 preschoolers into two groups.In one group,parents recorded notes about kids' normal TV viewing,without receiving any guidelines to reduce or change those habits.In the other group,researchers made visits and calls and sent monthly newsletters encouraging parents to replace violent TV with educational programming.After six and 12 months,parents reported their kid's angry,aggressive or anxious behaviors on a questionnaire.At both time points,children in the TV intervention   program had slightly fewer problems than those in the comparison group.Boys in lowincome families seemed to benefit most from the change in programming,the researchers found. \\"The point is,this is something that is as effective as other things we do to try to guide behavior in children,and it's fairly simple,\\" Christakis said. Another study published in Pediatrics found the more TV kids and teens watched,the more likely they were to have a crime or other problems in society.Children may imitate violence they see--or more time in front of the TV could simply mean less communication with peers and families,and worse performance in school. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends kids watch no more than one to two hours of highquality programming each day.Researchers agreed parents should be mindful of what exactly their young kids are watching on TV as well.\\"It's  not just about turning the TV off,it's about changing the channel,\\"...

Answer the following question: Here's a question: What could happen to guns if they are wet?  Here are possible answers to this question: - misfire - explode - jam - break - take life  I believe the correct choice is \\"misfire\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The possible consequences of guns getting wet are indeed numerous and can result in different outcomes, depending on the extent and nature of the contact with water. Here, we will discuss each of the given options in detail to understand their likelihood and the reasoning behind the correct choice, \\"misfire.\\" 1. Misfire: A misfire occurs when a firearm fails to discharge as intended, often due to issues within the ammunition or the gun's firing mechanism. When a gun gets wet, water may seep into the chamber and come in contact with the gun's primer or propellant. This can cause the primer to fail or the propellant to not ignite properly, leading to insufficient energy to propel the projectile. Misfires are the most common issue associated with damp or wet guns, making it the correct choice. 2. Explode: While it is theoretically possible for a wet gun to explode, the likelihood of this happening is relatively low. In general, an explosion would require a blockage, such as a bullet lodged in the barrel, along with subsequent rounds being fired. This buildup of pressure might cause the barrel or chamber to rupture. Although water could potentially contribute to barrel obstruction, it is more likely to cause a misfire or jam, reducing the chances of an explosion. 3. Jam: A jam refers to any failure in the cycling process of a firearm. This can be caused by several factors, such as the failure of spent casings to eject properly, a double-feed, or the failure of a new round to load correctly into the chamber. When a gun becomes wet, the water may interfere with the proper functioning of the internal components, such as the slide or bolt, which can lead to a jam. While jams aren't uncommon after exposure to water, they are typically less likely to occur than misfires. 4. Break: In general, modern firearms are built to withstand a certain amount of exposure to the elements, including water. However, long-term exposure to moisture can cause rust and corrosion, particularly in guns that are made of metal components. While this may eventually lead to a weakened firearm, it is not a likely immediate consequence of getting a gun wet. Proper cleaning and maintenance can mitigate the risk of a gun breaking due to water exposure. 5. Take life: This option seems to refer to the potential for a wet gun to accidentally discharge and harm someone. While any malfunction of a firearm may potentially result in unintended consequences, the risks posed by a wet gun are more likely to be misfires and jams, rather than an accidental discharge. In conclusion, while several consequences may arise when a gun gets wet, the most likely outcome is a misfire. However, it is essential for gun owners to properly maintain and store their firearms to minimize any risks associated with their use, including the risk of malfunction due to water exposure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But on Monday, as teens at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, returned from spring break, they took to Twitter to mock the clear backpacks now required by their school district, describing them as a violation of privacy, a meaningless gesture and a distraction from real gun reform.      My new backpack is almost as transparent as the NRA’s agenda.            I feel sooo safe now.            As much as I appreciate the effort we as a country need to focus on the real issue instead of turning our schools into prisons. #clearbackpacks #MarchForOurLives pic.twitter.com/HqBIeGjzF9 — Lauren Hogg (@lauren_hoggs) April 2, 2018      “My new backpack is almost as transparent as the NRA's agenda,” wrote Lauren Hogg, a freshman at the school and a survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting that killed 17 students and faculty members.      “I feel sooo safe now,\\" wrote Lauren, the younger sister of David Hogg, a Stoneman Douglas senior who has emerged as one of the leading student voices for gun control. \\"As much as I appreciate the effort we as a country need to focus on the real issue instead of turning our schools into prisons.”      The backpacks, which were provided to students at no charge, are among the new security measures introduced by the Broward County school district in the shooting's aftermath.      As students lined up between metal barricades to get those backpacks checked before heading through school doors, some said they felt overwhelmed by the new safety policies.      “The see-through bags is a tad much, it’s an invasion of privacy,” Gabriel Edenbaum, 15, a freshman who survived the shooting, told NBC News on Tuesday. Despite all the changes on school grounds, he says he understands it’s to protect the students. When asked about the police force, Edenbaum said it can be “scary.”      “We’re just trying to learn,” said Edenbaum.      In a letter to students’ families last month,Robert Runcie, superindent of Broward County schools, said the district was considering installing metal detectors and using wands. Florida Highway Patrol officers will provide security at the high school, but each school in the district will have its own school resource officer by the start of the 2018-19 school year.      New identification badges to be worn at all times, a greater police presence, continuously locked classroom doors: the list of safety initiatives from Runcie goes on and on.      The new measures, Runcie said, are meant to help “fortify” the school and expand safety protocols.      But many students were having none of it.      “Starting off the last quarter of senior year right, with a good ol' violation of privacy!” one student, Delaney Tarr, said on Twitter.      “Now I can’t lie about not having gum,” scoffed another.      Some students used the see-through material of the backpacks to display protest signs and messages.      \\"This bag contains everything politicians care about besides money,\\" read Lex Michael's sign in the pocket of an empty clear backpack.      Another student, Sarah Chadwick, snapped a photo of the new backpacks with price tags attached and tweeted directly at Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — a nod to what she has previously characterized as students’ “worth” to the senator, who she calculated has received 3.3 million from the National Rifle Association, or 1.05 for each of Florida's estimated 3.1 million students.      “Is that all we’re worth to these politicians?” Chadwick asked during a rally last month.      Rubio has said that while he supports the students’ right to protest for what he described as \\"a gun ban,\\" he doesn’t agree with all their proposals. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

The backpacks are part of the new safety measures taking effect at the Parkland school, where 17 people were shot and killed and 17 others were wounded Feb. 14.      On social media, particularly Twitter, many Stoneman Douglas students were showing off their backpack hacks, or the ways in which they’ve managed to personalize their new school bags.      Many of the students used their new backpacks to make a statement, with the inference being that trying to reduce gun violence with transparent plastic backpacks was ridiculous, and for some, insulting.      “Clear backpacks are stupid,” one student wrote on a sheet of paper he was displaying from the inside of his backpack.      Others were attaching the 1.05 price tag used by some students to protest Florida Senator Marco Rubio.      “When you take 3,140,167, the number of students enrolled in Florida schools, and divide it by 3,303,355, the amount of money Marco Rubio has received from the National Rifle Association, it comes out to 1.05,” studen Sarah Chadwick said in her speech at the March For Our Lives rally in Washington on March 24.      Yet others pointed out that the new backpacks could bring unwanted attention to personal items.      Other students saw some humor in the situation.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Older fathers have uglier children, researchers have claimed after linking age to genetic mutations . The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist  at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres  - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Researchers said men should be advised about the potential problems in order to help their personal...

Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a behavior disorder that occurs during deep sleep, resulting in episodes where a person performs activities while being asleep and unconscious. The person is often not aware of their actions, and they usually have no memory of the event when they wake up. The other options provided are not related to unconscious involuntary movements at night: 1. Hungry: This refers to the feeling of needing or wanting food, which has no direct connection to trance-like states or involuntary movements at night. 2. Peacefulness: This refers to a state of calmness or tranquility, which can be experienced at night but does not signify any unconscious involuntary movement. 3. Religious experience: A religious experience may evoke feelings of trance, but it does not specifically relate to unconscious involuntary movement at night. 4. Loss of balance: Although losing balance can occur at night, it is not directly associated with going into a trance or any unconscious involuntary movement.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Translating Henry James for the Screen Onata Aprile and Alexander Skarsgard in the coming âWhat Maisie Knew.â When Henry James’s novel “What Maisie Knew” was published in 1897, the movies were in their infancy — the brothers Lumière had exhibited their first motion pictures just two years earlier — and there’s no evidence that in the 19 years of life that remained to James he ever cared a jot for the new medium; it wouldn’t have met his standards. The movies have since avenged that slight in a way that seems at least arguably Jamesian: They have paid his work the ambiguous tribute of their attention. Dozens of adaptations of his difficult, delicate fictions have been produced since his death, all trying (and most failing) to capture something of his essence, the elusive beast in the verbal jungle. Alison Elliott, left, with Helena Bonham Carter in âThe Wings of the Doveâ (1997). The latest filmmakers to venture into the murk and tangle of James’s world are Scott McGehee and David Siegel, whose version of “What Maisie Knew” opens on Friday. “Maisie” isn’t among the most obviously daunting works in the canon. It’s relatively short and the plot, such as it is, seems straightforward: the drama revolves around the shifting affections of bright little Maisie (Onata Aprile), as she is passed back and forth among her divorced parents (Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan) and other grown-ups, all of whom claim to have her best interests at heart. The trick, of course, is figuring out which, if any, of them actually do; it’s a lot to ask of a child. Like most of James’s best fiction, “What Maisie Knew” is about the subtle workings of power, of influence — of sway; as always in his work, the machinations are terrifying. Mr. McGehee and Mr. Siegel have decided, bravely, to do away with a good deal of what makes James’s worldview so distinctively dark: they have updated the story to the present day, eliminated one of the novel’s most important characters (the moralistic governess Mrs. Wix) and, while respecting the complexities of their young heroine’s predicament, drastically reduced the general ominousness of the original’s tone. This must be the sunniest Henry James movie ever made. Purists may squawk, and they’d have a point, but James is so movie-resistant anyway that it hardly seems worth the effort to be outraged. The movie doesn’t “get” him because he can’t be gotten, really, in any medium other than the one in which he so meticulously labored. Practically every filmmaker who has set out in search of James has ended up somewhere else, either by design (like Mr. McGehee and Mr. Siegel) or by inadvertence, lost among the tendrils of the writer’s lush consciousness. The more closely a film tries to follow him, it seems, the farther afield it goes. Those who have stuck most faithfully to the plots of his novels, like the Merchant Ivory team in “The Europeans” (1979), “The Bostonians” (1984) and “The Golden Bowl” (2000), or the gentlefolk of the BBC — who have recently bundled a few of their earnest attempts in a DVD set called “The Henry James Collection” — have tended to bring forth dramas without drama, because the action in James rarely matters much. Everything that counts is under the surface, in the tortured, painfully refined minds of his characters, and James wasn’t, for all his gifts, very good at inventing situations that could show an audience, rather than tell it, what lay beneath his people’s apparently banal words and gestures. He was a notoriously unsuccessful playwright. Showing instead of telling is what movies are supposed to do, and you have to wonder what possesses a filmmaker who turns the last page of, say, “The Portrait of a Lady” or “The Wings of the Dove” and thinks it would make a hell of a picture. Even the most intelligent attempts to be wholly faithful to his stories and his characters — films like Peter Bogdanovich’s “Daisy Miller” (1974), Jane Campion’s “Portrait of a Lady” (1996) and Agnieszka Holland’s “Washington Square” (1997) — seem finally to bump up against something stubborn and unyielding in the material. In the absence of strong, clearly defined dramatic action James’s leisurely plots can feel frustratingly irresolute, and the characters’ many scruples and hesitancies, so evocative on the page, can become downright puzzling on the screen. Moviegoers aren’t noted for their patience. What’s fascinating about James adaptations is how starkly they draw the aesthetic battle lines between the narrative arts of literature and film. In the writer’s own lifetime, the contest was unequal, but, as he knew, the balance of power in any relationship can shift — often subtly, almost unnoticeably — in the course of time, and the movies’ sway over the imagination of the public has increased exponentially in the century or so since their obscure birth. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the actress who plays Maisie in Scott McGehee and David Siegelâs version of âWhat Maisie Knew.â She is Onata Aprile, not Joanna Vanderham, who plays Margo, a nanny.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Indon push for extra-marital sex crime When legal academics and child rights advocates gathered at Indonesia's Constitutional Court this week in a bid to criminalise sex outside of the marital bed, the words \\"lust\\", \\"urges\\", \\"God\\" and \\"America\\" were never far from their lips. Showing a photograph of gay rights supporters in front of the US Supreme Court building and then an image of people at a LGBT pride rally, University of Indonesia law lecturer Hamid Chalid was adamant. \\"This is what happened in America ... Is this what we want? Our hopes rest on the Constitutional Court.\\" Mr Chalid is one of a number of people involved in the constitutional court challenge seeking amendments to laws on adultery, rape and sex with a minor under Indonesia's criminal code. They are calling for the criminalisation of extra-marital sex - including same-sex. - saying \\"religious values must be reinstated as society's living principle\\". Extra-marital sex should carry punishments of up to nine months jail, while the maximum sentence for same-sex intercourse should be five years, they argue. Mr Chalid told a court hearing in Jakarta this week that the purpose of the change was to \\"reignite\\" the highest level of human consciousness - \\"godliness\\" - and prevent the country from shifting with the winds of \\"lust\\". In America he said the desire to become \\"more liberal\\" had resulted in no boundaries. \\"In two years, in three years, in five years ... will there be a decision from US Supreme Court that marriage between father and his daughter or between son and his mother are legal?\\" he told the court. For a group of women who had travelled via bus from Bandung in West Java to Jakarta for the hearing, these fears are real. Wearing matching hijabs and outfits, the women echoed out calls of \\"Allahu Akbar\\" (\\"God is Great\\") when Asrorun Ni'am Sholeh, Chairman of the Indonesian Children Protection Commission said the only proper way to channel \\"sexual urges\\" was through marriage. Mr Sholeh told the court extra-marital sex must be prohibited as it was a violation against children's basic rights - burdening them \\"socially and psychologically\\". \\"Children born from extra-marital sexual intercourse are prone to violence, abandonment and negligence,\\" he stated, sparking calls of \\"Astaghfirullah\\" (\\"May God Forgive\\") from the women. Sex within the LGBT community was also seen as a moral danger in need of clamping down. \\"Lewd\\" same-sex acts had the tendency to lead to \\"addiction\\", Mr Sholeh warned with children most at risk of their \\"deception\\". Judging by the reception of those on the bench at the Constitutional Court, those launching the legal action have some chance of success. During the hearing Judge Patrialis Akbar said Indonesia's perspective on human rights was different to that of the United Nations (UN). \\"Human rights freedom in our country has limitation. First, it's limited that it can't violate other's human rights. That's the basic principle. Secondly, our freedom is also limited by moral values and also limited by religious values,\\" he added. Founder of the Indonesian LGBT rights group GAYa Nusantara and academic Dr Dede Oetomo said it appeared the court was becoming more conservative. \\"They cannot differentiate which one is positive law principle and which one is religious principle.\\" Dr Oetomo is worried the community, courts and politicians were playing it safe, with those holding secular views hesitant to challenge religious feelings out of fear they will be labelled blasphemous. The court challenge comes off the back of what Human Rights Watch labelled an \\"unprecedented attack\\" on LGBT rights this year. House of Representatives member Reni Marlinawati said same-sex relationships violated \\"religious norms\\" while Defence Minister Ryamizad Ryacudu compared it to a \\"proxy war\\" more dangerous than a nuclear bomb. Activists have criticised the silence from President Joko Widodo's government as an indication of their unwillingness to stand up against these conservative forces. Dr Oetomo believes fears around sexuality in Indonesia stemmed from a lack of education in school. A challenge made even more difficult by the appointment of Muhajir Effendi as Education Minister in the recent cabinet reshuffle, he said. Mr Effendi is from Muhammadiyah, one of Indonesia's largest Islamic organisations, and the rector of one of their universities. \\"It will certainly be prohibited to have sexual education. It's like we're doomed,\\" Dr Oetomo said. The hearing will continue next week.","output":"A group of legal academics and child rights advocates are pushing the Indonesian Constitutional Court to criminalise any sex outside of the marital bed, including same-sex intercourse, arguing laws of adultery, rape and sex with a minor must be amended to include all forms of extra-marital sex.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Process:  - Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves - We feel the earthquake -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less force is exerted happens, how will it affect the crust will take longer to break.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process, both direct and indirect. In the perturbation hypothesis, when less force is exerted between the Earth's plates, it results in a slower plate movement and consequently, a delay in crust-breaking events. This change in force will directly affect the process of plate tectonics and the occurrence of earthquakes. Direct effects: 1. The reduced force between plates may take more time for the stress to build up in the Earth's crust to a point where it can cause the crust to break. Therefore, the frequency of earthquakes might be reduced. 2. The amount of stress released during the breaking of the crust may be lower, leading to less powerful earthquakes. This, in turn, may result in a smaller magnitude of seismic waves, causing less damage to the surface. Indirect effects: 1. The slower movement of plates and reduced force may contribute to alterations in the Earth's landscape, as the tectonic activities, such as mountain building and the formation of trenches, might take longer to occur. 2. The reduced frequency and intensity of earthquakes may also impact various other factors in the Earth's system, such as volcanic activities, which are related to the movement of tectonic plates. 3. The decreased intensity of earthquakes may indirectly affect the preparedness and response efforts of communities to such natural disasters. People may become less concerned about the risks of earthquakes, which could result in less stringent building codes, infrastructure, and emergency protocols. In summary, the proposed perturbation of exerting less force on the Earth's plates will directly affect the process of crust breaking and indirectly impact various other geological processes, landscape formations, earthquake-related threats, and human preparedness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: What is required for interconversion between the two forms of an isomeric pair?   A: A:","output":"For the interconversion between the two forms of an isomeric pair, the process of breaking and reforming bonds is required. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but a different arrangement of atoms in space. They can be categorized into two main types: structural isomers and stereoisomers. Structural isomers, also known as constitutional isomers, have a different connectivity of atoms within the molecule. The interconversion process between structural isomers needs a complete breaking and reforming of bonds to rearrange the atoms within the molecule. Stereoisomers, on the other hand, are molecules with the same connectivity of atoms but with a different spatial arrangement. Stereoisomers can be further classified into two types: geometric isomers and optical isomers. 1. Geometric isomers (also called cis-trans or E/Z isomers) occur in molecules with a double bond or other restricted rotation elements hindering free rotation around the bond. For the interconversion between these geometric isomers, breaking the double bond and reforming it with a different spatial alignment is required. 2. Optical isomers (also called enantiomers or chiral isomers) are molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other, similar to a pair of hands. The interconversion between optical isomers requires the breaking and reforming of bonds around the chiral center—an atom around which the substituents are arranged in such a way that the resulting molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. In both cases, the breaking and reforming of bonds involve the absorption, release, or redistribution of energy in the molecular system. This energy can be introduced through various means such as heat, light, or a chemical reaction with an external reagent. Interconversion may also involve passing through an intermediate state or transition state, which may result in the formation of other species before the final product. In summary, the interconversion between the two forms of an isomeric pair requires the breaking and reforming of bonds within the molecule, with the process often involving the absorption or release of energy and potentially passing through intermediate or transition states. This rearrangement leads to different spatial configurations of atoms, giving rise to the distinct properties and behaviors exhibited by the isomers."},{"instruction":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Hoya XO via Ace Review: This listing is for a Hoya MC (multi-coated) filter.

Plant diseases have ruined crops, bringing widespread famine. Many plant pathogens are fungi that cause tissue decay and eventual death of the host (Figure 24.25). In addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins. Fungi are also responsible for food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops. For example, the fungus Claviceps purpurea causes ergot, a disease of cereal crops (especially of rye). Although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot's alkaloid toxins on humans and animals are of much greater significance. In animals, the disease is referred to as ergotism. The most common signs and symptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle. The active ingredient of ergot is lysergic acid, which is a precursor of the drug LSD. Smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal pathogens that affect crops.

Context: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan.

Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other.

Bioengineers print ears that look and act like the real thing      Lindsay France/University Photography      Lindsay France/University Photography Cornell bioengineers and physicians have created an artificial ear that looks and acts like a natural ear, giving new hope to thousands of children born with a congenital deformity called microtia. In a study published online Feb. 20 in PLOS One, Cornell biomedical engineers and Weill Cornell Medical College physicians described how 3-D printing and injectable gels made of living cells can fashion ears that are practically identical to a human ear. Over a three-month period, these flexible ears grew cartilage to replace the collagen that was used to mold them. \\"This is such a win-win for both medicine and basic science, demonstrating what we can achieve when we work together,\\" said co-lead author Lawrence Bonassar, associate professor of biomedical engineering. The novel ear may be the solution reconstructive surgeons have long wished for to help children born with ear deformity, said co-lead author Dr. Jason Spector, director of the Laboratory for Bioregenerative Medicine and Surgery and associate professor of plastic surgery at Weill Cornell. \\"A bioengineered ear replacement like this would also help individuals who have lost part or all of their external ear in an accident or from cancer,\\" Spector said. Replacement ears are usually constructed with materials that have a Styrofoam-like consistency, or sometimes, surgeons build ears from a patient's harvested rib. This option is challenging and painful for children, and the ears rarely look completely natural or perform well, Spector said. To make the ears, Bonassar and colleagues started with a digitized 3-D image of a human subject's ear and converted the image into a digitized \\"solid\\" ear using a 3-D printer to assemble a mold. They injected the mold with collagen derived from rat tails, and then added 250 million cartilage cells from the ears of cows. This Cornell-developed, high-density gel is similar to the consistency of Jell-O when the mold is removed. The collagen served as a scaffold upon which cartilage could grow. The process is also fast, Bonassar added: \\"It takes half a day to design the mold, a day or so to print it, 30 minutes to inject the gel, and we can remove the ear 15 minutes later. We trim the ear and then let it culture for several days in nourishing cell culture media before it is implanted.\\" The incidence of microtia, which is when the external ear is not fully developed, varies from almost 1 to more than 4 per 10,000 births each year. Many children born with microtia have an intact inner ear, but experience hearing loss due to the missing external structure. Bonassar and Spector have been collaborating on bioengineered human replacement parts since 2007. Bonassar has also worked with Weill Cornell neurological surgeon Dr. Roger Härtl on bioengineered disc replacements using some of the same techniques demonstrated in the PLOS One study. The researchers specifically work on replacement human structures that are primarily made of cartilage -- joints, trachea, spine, nose -- because cartilage does not need to be vascularized with a blood supply in order to survive. They are now looking at ways to expand populations of human ear cartilage cells in the laboratory so that these cells can be used in the mold, instead of cow cartilage. \\"Using human cells, specifically those from the same patient, would reduce any possibility of rejection,\\" Spector said. He added that the best time to implant a bioengineered ear on a child would be when they are about 5 or 6 years old. At that age, ears are 80 percent of their adult size. If all future safety and efficacy tests work out, it might be possible to try the first human implant of a Cornell bioengineered ear in as little as three years, Spector said.  ||||| WEDNESDAY, Feb. 20 (HealthDay News) -- The emerging field of 3-D printing is able to now create artificial human ears that look and act like real ears, researchers say.      The artificial ears could give hope to children born with ear deformities or people who have lost all or part of their ear in an accident or from cancer, said the Cornell University team.      Currently, many artificial ears are made with materials that have a Styrofoam-like feeling. Or surgeons can build ears from a patient's rib, but this is challenging and painful for children and the ears rarely look completely natural or perform well, according to the study authors.      The new process begins with a digitized 3-D image of a patient's ear, which is turned into a mold using a 3-D printer. A special gel that contains collagen is injected into the mold. The collagen serves as a scaffold upon which cartilage can grow.      The process is fast, according to co-lead author Lawrence Bonassar, an associate professor of biomedical engineering.      \\"It takes half a day to design the mold, a day or so to print it, 30 minutes to inject the gel, and we can remove the ear 15 minutes later. We trim the ear and then let it culture for several days in nourishing cell culture media before it is implanted,\\" he explained in a university news release.      The artificial ears are practically identical to natural ears, according to the researchers.      Children born with a rare deformity called microtia -- poorly developed outer ears -- may be key beneficiaries of the new technology. Microtia occurs in anywhere from one to four in every 10,000 births, the researchers noted. These children have an intact inner ear but they suffer hearing loss due to an insufficient outer ear.      Study co-author Dr. Jason Spector, director of the Laboratory for Bioregenerative Medicine and Surgery and associate professor of plastic surgery at Weill Cornell in New York City, said the best time to implant a bioengineered ear would be around the age of 5 or 6, because the human ear is already at 80 percent of its adult size by then.      The study was published online Feb. 20 in the journal PLoS One.      If tests go well and prove the safety and effectiveness of the prosthetic, the first human implant of this new type of artificial ear could take place in as soon as three years, the Cornell team said.

What senior British Army officer known for his \\"scorched earth policy\\" experienced success in the British effort to re-conquer the sudan?","output":"The senior British Army officer known for his \\"scorched earth policy\\" and success in the British effort to re-conquer the Sudan was Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener, First Earl Kitchener of Khartoum. Born on June 24, 1850, in County Kerry, Ireland, Kitchener served as a prominent figure in British military history, particularly during the Sudan Campaign and later in World War I. Kitchener demonstrated his military prowess during the reconquest of Sudan in the late 19th century, spanning from 1896 to 1898. Serving as the Sirdar, or commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Army, he successfully led the Anglo-Egyptian forces against the Mahdist State. Utilizing the scorched earth policy, Kitchener’s forces systematically destroyed resources, infrastructure, and crops needed to support enemy forces in a region. The high point of Kitchener's campaign came during the Battle of Omdurman on September 2, 1898. In this decisive battle, Kitchener's army crushed the remaining Mahdist forces, effectively ending the Mahdist State and re-establishing British and Egyptian control over Sudan. Kitchener's victory was significant not only for its strategic implications, but also for his effective use of modern military technologies and tactics, which played a crucial role in turning the tide of battle in favor of his forces. Following his successes in Sudan, Kitchener went on to serve in various prominent positions within the British Army, including the Boer War in South Africa and World War I. He held the title of Secretary of State for War during the early years of World War I and was known for his steadfast efforts to create and manage a vastly expanded British fighting force. Tragically, Kitchener died on June 5, 1916, when the ship he was aboard, HMS Hampshire, struck a mine and sank off the Orkney Islands."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the leader who brought Armenians with the Mongols who returned to Jerusalem? ?  Without support from the Europeans, some Franks in Outremer, particularly the Knights Hospitaller of the fortress of Marqab, and to some extent the Franks of Cyprus and Antioch, attempted to join in combined operations with the Mongols in 1280–1281. The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to disorganization in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun. He advanced north from Egypt in March 1281, positioned his own army between the Franks and Mongols, and then further divided the potential allies by renewing a truce with the Barons of Acre on May 3, 1281, extending it for another ten years and ten months (a truce he would later breach). He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on July 16, 1281, and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 of their own troops, plus 30,000 others including Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent a contingent even though...

One major advantage of a single-rail roller coaster is that it enables much quicker and smoother turns than dual-rail models. According to a Six Flags engineer, the difference between the new roller coaster and slower monorail systems is significant, with the Wonder Woman coaster offering an exceptionally exhilarating ride. As it glides effortlessly along the narrow steel track, passengers can expect to experience high-speed twists and turns that are both extremely quick and \\"crazy smooth,\\" providing an entirely new level of excitement. The coaster will take riders on a thrilling journey through one-of-a-kind elements and impressive feats of engineering. As passengers climb to a height of 113 feet, they will reach top speeds of 52 miles per hour before plunging down steep drops and twisting around tight corners, offering a truly unique and unforgettable roller coaster experience. This innovative design aims to provide visitors with a heightened sense of adrenaline, as the streamlined, single-rail track allows for precise, dynamic movements that previously were not possible with two-rail systems. In addition to its engineering breakthroughs, the Wonder Woman Golden Lasso Coaster is set to become an iconic staple of Six Flags Fiesta Texas, contributing to the park's reputation as a premier destination for thrill-seekers. The single-rail IBox track roller coaster will not only introduce unprecedented levels of excitement but also showcase the park's commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in roller coaster design and technology. As anticipation builds for the Wonder Woman Golden Lasso Coaster's grand opening, visitors to Six Flags Fiesta Texas can look forward to experiencing a game-changing attraction that shatters traditional roller coaster conventions. The innovative and immersive design promises to deliver a genuinely unparalleled roller coaster experience that will leave riders in awe and forever change their expectations of what a roller coaster can be."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What genre ended when plays were banned?\\" is in \\"The end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries. Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in Greek and Roman theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The genre that ended when plays were banned is medieval religious drama. This genre of drama primarily consisted of plays that depicted stories and themes from the Bible and focused on the religious teachings and morals of the Catholic Church during the medieval period. The decline and eventual demise of medieval religious drama can be attributed to several factors, including the weakening influence of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation, and bans on religious plays implemented in various countries. From the 16th century, events such as the Protestant Reformation and the shifting religious landscape in Europe resulted in an increasingly fragmented and secularized society. As a result, playwrights and theatrical producers began to focus on secular subjects and themes that were more reflective of contemporary society. In England, Elizabeth I banned all religious plays in 1558, and by the 1580s, the great cycle plays, which were significant religious dramas revolving around the biblical narrative, had been silenced. In the Netherlands, religious plays were banned in 1539, followed by similar bans by the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. These bans essentially dismantled the international theatre framework that had previously been centered around religious stories and themes and paved the way for each country to develop its own distinct form of drama that was disconnected from medieval religious drama. This shift led to a renewed focus on and interest in Greek and Roman theatre, resulting in a diverse range of secular and classical-inspired drama that would shape the European theatre in the centuries that followed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Annie Dillard believes that Options:  A. not enough information  B.

Barack Obama Monday proposed spending billions to revitalize the nation's economy, a plan the campaign of his likely Republican opponent said would slow economic growth with higher taxes. Sen. Barack Obama wants to spend 60 billion on America's infrastructure. During an economic speech in Flint, Michigan, Obama promised to spend billions to improve America's education, infrastructure, energy and health care systems. To improve America's competitiveness, the senator from Illinois said he wants to spend 10 billion on childhood education, 150 billion over 10 years on developing alternative energy and 60 billion over 10 years to build \\"21st century infrastructure.\\" During his speech in","output":"Flint, Michigan, Obama emphasized the importance of investing in the country's future and building a strong foundation for economic growth and stability. He argued that these investments would create millions of well-paying jobs, reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil, and provide a higher quality of life for all Americans. The presidential candidate also touched upon the need for innovation in the healthcare sector, proposing a 50 billion investment in fully implementing electronic health records and modernizing medical practices to reduce errors and improve patient care. Additionally, he called for the expansion of broadband access across rural areas to bridge the digital divide and boost local economies. To finance these ambitious initiatives, Obama outlined a plan to end tax breaks for companies that outsource jobs overseas, close corporate tax loopholes, and roll back the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. He emphasized that this would ensure that the financial burden is shared fairly and effectively between the different income classes in the United States. Despite the criticism from his Republican opponents, who argued that increasing taxes would hinder economic growth, Obama contended that his approach would ultimately promote long-term economic prosperity through targeted investments in critical sectors of the American economy. He expressed confidence that these measures would establish a solid foundation for a more resilient and prosperous America in the face of global challenges and uncertainties. In conclusion, during his speech in Flint, Michigan, then-Senator Barack Obama laid out a comprehensive plan to revitalize the nation's economy through strategic investments in education, infrastructure, energy, and healthcare. He maintained that this plan would create jobs, enhance national competitiveness, and ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities for all Americans. Critics, however, argued that the associated tax hikes would have adverse effects on economic growth.

Offices are small and mostly plain, except for the eclectic mix of pop art, African statuary and neon that adorns litigation director Webb Brewer's space. Brewer, who has been at the agency 20 years, said there is a need for lawyers of all stripes to help with the problems of the poor. \\"The private bar could meet more of the need through pro bono work, but there are still cases that involve the systemic problems for low-income people that we would need to do,\\" said Brewer. \\"The legal system marketplace just doesn't serve low-income people too well, except in fee-generat-ing type cases,\\" Brewer said. \\"If a poor person gets run over by a bus, an attorney might take that case because they might be able to recover part of the damage award as attorney fees.

Film studios, especially in animation, often use sequences of images as guides for film sequences. These storyboards are not intended as an end product and are rarely seen by the public. Wordless novels are books which use sequences of captionless images to deliver a narrative. A book with pictures with no captions that tell a story are called what?","output":"A book with pictures and no captions that tell a story is called a wordless novel. Wordless novels rely on a series of captionless images, which are often intricately designed and artistically rendered, to convey a narrative without the use of text. They challenge readers to interpret the story through visual cues and context clues, inviting them to explore and dive deep into the creator's imagination. Wordless novels can be considered a form of comics since they share the elements of sequential art and storytelling, even though they lack the traditional written dialogue or captions typically associated with comics. The storytelling is entirely accomplished through the progression of images that help the readers understand the characters, settings, emotions, and plot development. Some examples of wordless novels include \\"The Arrival\\" by Shaun Tan, \\"The Snowman\\" by Raymond Briggs, and \\"A Boy, a Dog, and a Frog\\" by Mercer Mayer. These books explore various themes and subjects, with artists pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling through their art. In contrast, storyboards are a series of images used primarily as a guide for film sequences, particularly in the field of animation. While they also present a story through sequential images, their main purpose is to serve as a blueprint for filmmakers to visualize and plan their shots and scenes rather than an end product for public consumption. As a result, while they share some similarities with wordless novels, their intended purpose and audience are quite different."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's Albert Pyun who has directed these two as well! The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live under medieval circumstances.

But in fact this giant jellyfish is harmless to humans – and a long way from home. Usually found in the Atlantic or the Mediterranean, the creature was spotted by wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella in Portland, Dorset, and is one of ten seen recently along the south coast. Experts say there could be an influx of these barrel jellyfish – up to 3ft 2in in diameter – over the next few months due to warmer weather. 'Invasion': The latest in a string of barrel jellyfish sightings has been reported on a beach in Portland, Dorset. Above, wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella poses with the enormous creature, measuring 3ft in diameter. Richard Harrington of the Marine. Conservation Society said: ‘Although this species is harmless … we still. advise the public not to touch them.’ It comes just days after a jellyfish the size of a dustbin lid was sighted on the island by dog walker Suzanne Sheldon. Following her discovery, Ms Sheldon, 47, said: 'It was at least three feet in width and was very bulky too. It was the largest jellyfish I had ever seen.' Experts have warned that there could be an influx of the sea creatures as the weather warms up. Enormous: Experts have warned that we could see an influx of the sea creatures as temperatures soar to 20C toward the end of May. Above, the jellyfish which was spotted by the 49-year-old photographer, from Wareham. Washed up: Mr Trewhella believes the huge creature was washed ashore during strong winds and high tides. Forecasters expect high pressure to take hold later in May - sending temperatures soaring above 20C. In recent weeks, up to 10 barrel jellyfish have been spotted washed up on beaches around the South Coast. High numbers: In recent weeks, up to 10 barrel jellyfish have been spotted washed up on beaches around the south coast. Left, the jellyfish spotted by Mr Trewhella and, right, local Julie Hatcher poses with another jellyfish. Mr Harrington added: 'This is an Atlantic species and are sometimes found washed up but we still advise the public not to touch them.' But Mr Trewhella believes the creatures have come ashore because of strong winds and high tides. 'It's not that unusual to see jellyfish, they aren't particularly common in Dorset but we do see them every once in a while,' said the photographer. 'Jellyfish are a form of plankton, and the warm weather means we might see an increase in the levels of plankton. Another finding: It comes just days after a jellyfish the size of a dustbin lid was sighted on a beach in Portland. 'This is something that occurs around this time every year and it is known as the plankton boom. 'However, it is not the warm weather that causes jellyfish to wash up, instead it's the wind and tides that leave them stranded on beaches.

'Very bulky': Dog walker Suzanne Sheldon, who discovered the creature, said it was 'at least three foot in width' Barrel jellyfish - Rhizostoma pulmo in Latin - are often known as dustbin-lid jellyfish because of their enormous size. They are commonly found in the north east Atlantic, Adriatic, and Mediterranean sea and are prey to leatherback turtles. Experts have warned that some of the jellyfish can sting and anyone affected should seek medical attention.","output":"A giant jellyfish, as big as a dustbin lid, appeared on a beach in Portland, Dorset.

Sparks are an American pop and rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1972 by brothers Ron (keyboards) and Russell Mael (vocals). The duo formed in 1968 under the name Halfnelson. Known for their quirky approach to songwriting, Sparks' music is often accompanied by intelligent, sophisticated, and acerbic lyrics, and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified in the contrast between Russell's animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's deadpan scowling. They are also noted for Russell Mael's distinctive falsetto voice and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style. Brothers Ron and Russell Mael grew up in Pacific Palisades, in western Los Angeles County, California, during the \\"Golden Age\\" of the LA club scene, with the Doors, Love and the Standells regularly playing the Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Strip and the Beach Boys playing the afternoon event Teenage Fair. Both Ron and Russell Mael are seen in the audience during the Ronettes' section of the concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, filmed in 1966. Both attended UCLA, Ron studying cinema and graphic art, Russell theatre arts and filmmaking. Detesting the folk music scene, which they considered \\"cerebral and sedate and we had no time for that\\", they developed a particular taste in English bands of the time such as the Who, Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, the Kinks and the Move, which led to their description of themselves as \\"Anglophiles\\".  Forming Halfnelson in 1968, they soon came to the attention of producer Todd Rundgren, at whose urging Albert Grossman signed the band to his Bearsville record label. Their eponymous debut album - with the line-up consisting of college friend Earle Mankey on guitar, Mankey's brother James on bass, Harley Feinstein on drums and Rundgren producing - sold poorly, but after switching labels to Warner Bros. Records and renaming themselves Sparks, a play on the Marx Brothers, the re-issued debut spawned the minor regional hit \\"Wonder Girl\\".  Their follow-up album, A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing, led to a tour of the United Kingdom, including a residency at the Marquee Club in London, These London appearances helped them to secure a significant cult following. An appearance on the BBC Television's The Old Grey Whistle Test led to wider interest where host Bob Harris compared the band to a cross between Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention and the Monkees.

To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists, the very word \\"national\\" was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown. During the debate over the establishment clause, Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government (in which the states retained their individual sovereignty), which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Why was the language included?\\" lies in the efforts to appease the Anti-Federalists during the debate over the establishment clause. Initially, James Madison proposed language stating that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a \\"national religion\\". However, this was considered a cause for alarm by both Anti-Federalists and Federalists due to their experience under the British crown, as the word \\"national\\" evoked concerns about the potential centralization of power. To address these concerns, the House rejected Madison's initial language and replaced it with a more general term, \\"religion\\". This change was intended to mitigate fears and reach a compromise between the two opposing factions during the constitutional debates. Massachusetts Representative Elbridge Gerry's criticism towards Madison's language played a significant role in this situation, as it questioned whether the government being proposed was a national or a federal one, in which states would retain their individual sovereignty. Thus, the language was included to strike a balance between the Federalists' desire for a strong central government and the Anti-Federalists' concerns about protecting state sovereignty and individual liberties. This compromise allowed for the passage of the establishment clause and the creation of a government that respected the boundaries between national power and religious freedom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The Red Sea is parting again, but this time no one can help. Satellite pictures show that the Arabian plate and the African plate are moving away from each other, stretching the Earth's crust and widening the southern end of the Red Sea. Last September, series of earthquakes started splitting the planet's surface in Ethiopia. Over a period of three weeks, the sides on the rift separated by 26 feet. \\"We think that the crust is melted slowly at depths greater than 10 kilometers, where it is hotter, forming molten rock,\\" said Tim J Wright. \\"This molten rock rises through the crust because it is less dense than the surrounding rock.\\" The molten rock collects at depths of 3 to 5 kilometers. Wright explained, \\"Slowly, the pressure has been building up until last September when it finally cracked, breaking the crust.\\" The entry of molten rock into the gap between continents, rather than the cracking of the crust, is responsible for separation of continent drifts. For the past 30 million years Africa and Arabia have been going through the continental rifting process, the same one that made the Red Sea part again. \\"The ground is continually moving---much more rapidly now than before,\\" Wright said. \\"On average, the two sides move apart at about 2 centimeters per year.\\" This latest split, added to the long-term rifting process could eventually create a huge new sea. Although such processes could take millions of years to occur, this event has given scientists an opportunity to examine the break in real time. Question: The passage is mainly about  _  .

Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Ability to find things in filtered data","output":"The ability to find things in filtered data allows users to efficiently locate specific information or patterns within a large dataset. By applying various filters, it becomes easier to sort through data and identify trends, outliers, or areas of interest. This skill is particularly useful in fields such as data analysis, business intelligence, and research. To achieve this, one can use different types of filters such as text-based or numerical filters, or even a combination of both. These filters can be applied using tools like spreadsheets or more advanced data analysis software, depending on the complexity of the data. Text-based filters help filter data based on keywords, phrases, or patterns within the text fields. For instance, filtering customer feedback based on keywords like \\"excellent\\" or \\"poor\\" can provide insights into overall customer satisfaction. Numerical filters, on the other hand, allow users to filter data based on specific numbers or ranges. In a sales report, numerical filters can be used to find products with sales figures above or below a certain threshold. Another effective way to find things in filtered data is by using conditional filters. These filters evaluate data based on one or more conditions and help identify data that meets specific criteria. For example, a conditional filter can be employed to extract information about customers who live in a specific region and whose purchase totals exceed a certain value. Using advanced data analysis tools like SQL or data visualization software can further enhance the ability to find things in filtered data. SQL queries, for instance, can be used to filter, sort, and aggregate data from databases, making it easier to discover patterns or trends. Visualization tools, such as bar graphs, scatter plots, or heat maps, can provide a visual representation of filtered data, which makes spotting patterns or anomalies much simpler. In conclusion, the ability to find things in filtered data is of great importance in today's data-driven world. By applying various filters, users can narrow down the scope of data, making it easier to analyze and gain valuable insights. Combining numerical, textual, and conditional filters with advanced data analysis tools and visualization techniques can significantly improve the efficiency of data analysis and decision-making processes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For the second consecutive week, the game began with a touchdown on the Patriots' first series: this time, Brady hit Watson for a 7-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. On the first play of the ensuing Chargers possession, their first, linebacker Rosevelt Colvin intercepted a Philip Rivers pass, but it did not translate into points for the Patriots as Gostkowski then missed a 41-yard field goal attempt on the Patriots' resulting series. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots capped off a 10-play, 75-yard drive with a 23-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 14-0. Colvin then added a sack and forced fumble to his game statistics, as he strip-sacked Rivers after the Chargers reached the Patriots' 34-yard line and defensive lineman Vince Wilfork recovered the fumble for the Patriots' second forced turnover of the game. On the Patriots' next drive, which spanned into the second quarter, Brady was strip-sacked by linebacker Shawne Merriman at the Chargers' 29-yard line, but Brady recovered his own fumble to retain possession for the Patriots. Six plays later, a 24-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots' lead to 17-0. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots were pushed back to their 10-yard line after another Merriman sack of Brady. The Patriots would punt back to the Chargers, but on a 3rd-and-1 from the Patriots' 37-yard line, Rivers was intercepted by linebacker Adalius Thomas, who returned it 65&#160;yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 24-0 lead. The Chargers were unable to get past midfield on their next drive and punted, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line with just under three minutes to play in the first half. A 25-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Chargers safety Marlon McCree would help the Patriots reach the Chargers' 26-yard line, but Brady was intercepted by safety Clinton Hart at the Chargers' 10-yard line. The Chargers then ran one play to end the half. Receiving the kickoff to begin the second half, the Chargers embarked on a 16-play, 72-yard drive, reaching Patriots territory on a 22-yard third down reception by tight end Antonio Gates. Ten plays later, fullback Lorenzo Neal caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to put the Chargers on the scoreboard at 24-7. The Patriots responded by going 75&#160;yards on seven plays, taking a 31-7 lead on a 24-yard Moss touchdown reception, his second of the night. Three plays later, Rivers was intercepted by Patriots safety James Sanders at the Patriots' 38-yard line, but the play was nullified by a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Hobbs. Rivers completions of 19&#160;yards to wide receiver Malcom Floyd and 12&#160;yards to running back Michael Turner helped put the Chargers in the Patriots' red zone, where Rivers completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Gates on the second play of the fourth quarter to cut the Patriots' lead to 31-14.. On the ensuing kickoff, Chargers wide receiver Kassim Osgood forced a fumble of Hobbs after a 31-yard return that was recovered by Chargers cornerback Quentin Jammer at the Patriots' 31-yard line. However, Rivers was sacked twice for losses of 10&#160;yards each on the next two plays, the second of which was a strip-sack by Colvin that was recovered by offensive lineman Kris Dielman; the Chargers punted on 4th-and-30. Starting from their own 9-yard line with more than 13&#160;minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots did not surrender the ball back to the Chargers until there was less than four minutes left in the fourth quarter. This 15-play, 91-yard drive culminated in a 3-yard touchdown run by running back Sammy Morris, extending the Patriots' lead to 38-14. The Chargers could not convert a first down on their next possession, giving the ball back to the Patriots to end the game as they improved to 2-0. Based on the above article, answer a question.

While the app does perform its basic function of editing and managing host files, there are several areas where improvements could be made, both in terms of functionality and user experience. Firstly, the user interface is rather simple and minimalistic. Although it is easy to navigate, the design could use a more modern touch to make it aesthetically appealing. Additionally, there are some occasional lags and delays when opening or editing larger host files, and I believe optimizing the app's performance should be a priority for future updates. Regarding the features, the app offers a basic set of tools for editing and managing host files. While these work as intended, they could be expanded upon to cater to power users, such as the ability to organize host records into folders or categories and the option to sync files across different devices. This functionality would make managing and maintaining complex files more efficient for those who require it. Another aspect that could be improved is the in-app help and documentation. While the app has a minimal learning curve, a well-organized help section or tutorial would be beneficial for users who are new to the concept of managing and editing host files. Although the app is functional and serves its purpose, there are areas where improvements in performance, design, and features could make the com.nilhcem.hostseditor app a more comprehensive and user-friendly choice for editing and managing host files.

Amanda Knox's retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher opened in Florence today - but neither the American student nor her Italian ex-boyfriend was there to see the start of proceedings. Instead, the 26-year-old was photographed taking a walk in her home town of Seattle, more than 5,000 miles from the the trial. Miss Knox has said she will not return to Italy where she is accused of murdering her British roommate in 2007. Scroll down for video. Amanda Knox was all smiles in the rain in Seattle, Washington, as she chatted on the phone while picking up supplies at a pet store ahead of the re-trial in Italy. Knox and her one-time lover Rafaelle Sollecito served four years in jail for the murder of Meredith Kercher, who was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial. In June judges published the reasons for that decision, saying the ruling by the appeal court that freed them was full of ‘deficiencies contradictions and illogical conclusions’.

Does the sentence \\"It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What was the Meija era marked by?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What was the Meiji Era marked by?\\". However, since a long and detailed answer is required, let me expand on this topic. The Meiji Era was marked by Japan's rapid modernization and the transformation from an isolated feudal society to a nation standing on par with Western powers within just a few decades. This period spanned from 1868 to 1912 and was characterized by profound change in the political, social, economic, and cultural aspects of the country. Following the unification of Japan by the Tokugawa Shogunate in the early 17th century, the nation closed its borders to most foreign contact in an attempt to maintain ideological and political control. However, the arrival of American Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 and his display of naval and technological might led to the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854, which effectively forced Japan to end its isolationist policy. The Tokugawa Shogunate's inability to maintain Japan's sovereignty during this period amplified internal political strife and led to the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Emperor Meiji, under the guidance of a group of ambitious and talented samurais (such as Ito Hirobumi, Okubo Toshimichi, and Saigo Takamori), oversaw the collapse of the shogunate and the reestablishment of centralized imperial rule. To prevent further encroachment of foreign powers, Japan's leaders recognized that the key to preserving Japanese independence was to modernize and industrialize the nation, primarily by adopting Western technology, economic models, and political systems. Some of the significant changes during the Meiji Era included: 1. Political and Administrative Reform: The Meiji government adopted a modern, centralized bureaucratic structure and formulated the Meiji Constitution in 1889, which provided for a constitutionally limited monarchy and a bicameral legislature. 2. Economic Modernization: The Meiji government invested heavily in infrastructure like railways, telegraph lines, and modern ports. Additionally, it created a banking system, modernized the tax system, and initiated a series of industrial policies to promote domestic industry and reduce reliance on foreign products. 3. Military Reform: The Japanese military underwent significant modernization, as the government focused on adopting Western military techniques, tactics, and equipment. In 1873, universal conscription was introduced. By the 1890s, Japan had one of the most modern and powerful militaries in Asia. 4. Education Reform: Western-style education systems were introduced in the Meiji Era, emphasizing science, technology, and foreign languages. In 1872, a new Education Law established compulsory education for primary education in Japan, laying the foundation for a literate and skilled workforce. 5. Social and Cultural Change: The gradual erosion of the samurai class's dominance and the promotion of social mobility greatly impacted Japanese society. Japan's rapid modernization altered the cultural landscape as well, as the government encouraged the adoption of Western clothing, architecture, and artistic styles. 6. Foreign Policy: In a bid to revise the unequal treaties imposed on Japan by foreign powers in the mid-19th century, Japanese leaders looked to project their newfound strength and power internationally. This ambition led to military victories against China in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and against Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). In conclusion, the Meiji Era was marked by Japan's rapid and comprehensive modernization, resulting in remarkable political, economic, social, and cultural transformations that allowed Japan to establish itself as a world power. The sentence provided derives its validity from these transformations that occurred during the Meiji Era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information:  - Herodium (Latin), Herodeion, best known in Israel as Herodion and in Arabic as Jabal al-Fureidis (lit. \\"Paradise Hill\\") is a truncated cone-shaped hill, located south of Jerusalem and southeast of Bethlehem, in the Judaean Desert, West Bank. Herod the Great built a palace fortress and a small town at Herodium, between 23 and 15 BCE, and is believed to have been buried there. Herodium is 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level, the highest peak in the Judaean Desert. Today, the site is managed by the Israel National Parks Authority.  - The Second Temple was an important Jewish Holy Temple (\\"Beit HaMikdash HaSheni\\") which stood on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period, between 516 BCE and 70 CE. According to Jewish (and subsequently, Christian) tradition, it replaced Solomon's Temple (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, when Jerusalem was conquered and a portion of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken into exile in Babylon.  - Antipater II ( Greek :  ; c. 46 -- 4 BC ) was Herod the Great 's first - born son , his only child by his first wife Doris . He was named after his paternal grandfather Antipater the Idumaean . He and his mother were exiled after Herod divorced her between 43 BC and 40 BC to marry Mariamne I. However , he was recalled following Mariamne 's fall in 29 BC and in 13 BC Herod made him his first heir in his will . He retained this position even when Alexandros and Aristobulos ( Herod 's sons by Mariamne ) rose in the royal succession in 12 BC , and even became exclusive successor to the throne after their execution in 7 BC ( with Herod Philip I in second place ) . However , in 5 BC Antipater was brought before Publius Quinctilius Varus , then Roman governor of Syria , charged with the intended murder of his father Herod . Antipater was found guilty by Varus ; however , due to Antipater 's high rank , it was necessary for Caesar Augustus to approve of the recommended sentence of death . After the guilty verdict , Antipater 's position as exclusive successor was removed and granted to Herod Antipas . Once the sentence had approval from Augustus in 4 BC , Antipater was then executed , and Archelaus ( from the marriage with Malthace ) was made heir in his father 's will as king over Herod 's entire kingdom ( with Antipas and Philip as Tetrarchs over certain territories ) . We know two of Antipater 's wives through the writings of Josephus . First was his niece Mariamne III , daughter of Aristobulus IV. The second was a high - ranking Hasmonean princess whose first name is lost to history . She was the daughter of Antigonus the Hasmonean , the last Hasmonean king who also served as high priest . This wife of Antipater was also a first cousin of Mariamne I , renowned royal wife of Herod the Great . Josephus records that she was at the palace with Doris , Antipater 's mother , in support of her husband during his trial before Varus in 5 BC.  - Aristobulus II was the Jewish High Priest and King of Judea, 66 BC to 63 BC, from the Hasmonean Dynasty.  - Antipater I the Idumaean (died 43 BC) was the founder of the Herodian Dynasty and father of Herod the Great. According to Josephus, he was the son of Antipas (I) and had formerly held that name.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Judea or Judæa (from , \\"Yhuda\\", \\"Yhûh\\", ,  , \\"Yahudia\\") is the ancient biblical, Roman, and modern name of the mountainous southern part of Palestine. The name originates from the Hebrew, Canaanite and later neo-Babylonian and Persian name \\"Yehudah\\" or \\"Yehud\\" for the biblical Israelite tribe of Judah (Yehudah) and associated Kingdom of Judah, which the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia dates from 934 until 586 BCE. The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods as Yehud, Yehud Medinata, Hasmonean Judea, and consequently Herodian Judea and Roman Judea, respectively.  - Mariamne I (died 29 BCE), also called Mariamne the Hasmonean, was a Hasmonean princess and the second wife of Herod the Great. She was known for her great beauty, as was her brother Aristobulus III. Herod's fear of his rivals, the Hasmoneans, led to him executing all of the prominent members of the family, including Mariamne.  - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  - Titus Flavius Josephus (37  100), born Joseph ben Matityahu (Hebrew:   , \\"Yosef ben Matityahu\\"; Greek:  ), was a first-century Romano-Jewish scholar, historian and hagiographer, who was born in Jerusalemthen part of Roman Judeato a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry.  - The Herodian Dynasty was a Judean dynasty of Idumaean/Edomite descent. The Herodian dynasty began with Herod the Great, who assumed the throne of Judea, with Roman support, bringing down the century long Hasmonean Kingdom. His kingdom lasted until his death in 4 BCE, when it was divided between his sons as a Tetrarchy, which lasted for about 10 years. Most of those kingdoms, including Judea proper, were incorporated into Judaea Province in 6 CE, though limited Herodian kingship continued in Northern Levant until 92, when the last Herodian monarch, Agrippa II, died and Rome assumed full power over his domain.  - Herod (\\"Hordos\\", Greek: , \\"Hrds\\"; 74/73 BCE  4 BCE), also known as Herod the Great and Herod I, was a Roman client king of Judea, referred to as the Herodian kingdom. The history of his legacy has polarized opinion, as he is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea, including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem (Herod's Temple), the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima, the fortress at Masada and Herodium. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE RomanJewish historian Josephus. Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus. Despite his successes, including singlehandedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing, he still garnered criticism from various historians. His reign polarizes opinion amongst scholars and historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, or a reminder of his tyrannical rule.

Q:Information:  - Duatentopet or Tentopet was an Ancient Egyptian queen of the 20th dynasty and the wife of Pharaoh Ramesses IV and mother of Ramesses V. Even though the identity of Ramesses IV 's wife is nowhere stated , judging from her titles mentioned in her tomb ( QV74 ) she is the most likely candidate for this king 's wife . An Adoratrix named Tentopet appears with Ramesses III in the Temple of Khonsu in the Karnak temple complex . Tentopet is likely to have been a daughter of Ramesses III , and is likely to be identical with Queen Duatentopet , making her a sister or half - sister of her husband . Her steward Amenhotep was buried in Theban tomb TT346 .  - Heqamaatre Ramesses IV (also written Ramses or Rameses) was the third pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. His name prior to assuming the crown was Amonhirkhopshef. He was the fifth son of Ramesses III and was appointed to the position of crown prince by the twenty-second year of his father's reign when all four of his elder brothers predeceased him. His promotion to crown prince:  - Ramesses II (variously transliterated as \\"Rameses\\" or \\"Ramses\\" (or ); born ; died July or August 1213 BC; reigned 12791213 BC), also known as Ramesses the Great, was the third pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. He is often regarded as the greatest, most celebrated, and most powerful pharaoh of the Egyptian Empire. His successors and later Egyptians called him the \\"Great Ancestor\\". Ramesses II led several military expeditions into the Levant, reasserting Egyptian control over Canaan. He also led expeditions to the south, into Nubia, commemorated in inscriptions at Beit el-Wali and Gerf Hussein.  - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE.  - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.

The mother and son who are allergic to SUNLIGHT: Pair have rare condition which means exposure causes them agonising pain            Claire and Sam Turner have a condition that makes their skin very sensitive      Being exposed to sun or light, their skin can feel as if it's on fire            If they go outside during the day they have to cover all of their skin      They have to wear long sleeves, gloves and to tie scarves around their faces      Sam is even sensitive to light bulbs so at school has to sit in a dark corner            A mother and her son both suffer from a devastating allergy to the sun which means any exposure to it causes them agonising pain.            Claire Turner, 50, and son Sam, 13, have a rare medical condition called erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) - a condition which causes the skin becomes incredibly sensitive to natural light.            Any exposure to the sun causes them agonising pain and Sam’s allergy is so severe he has to remove some light bulbs in the family home because they cause his skin to feel as though it’s on fire.            Claire and Sam Turner have a rare genetic condition which makes their skin incredibly sensitive to sunlight      As a result, they are forced to stay under cover in the daylight hours and wear long sleeves, gloves and even masks to avoid spending days in agony.            Ms Turner and Sam even have to cover their faces with scarves if they venture out in sunlight.      Sam’s condition is so severe it is also triggered by low energy light bulbs and fluorescent strip lights - meaning every unknown building can be a danger to his health.      Ms Turner, from Thame, Oxfordshire, said: ‘We’re like a vampire family - we can’t come out in the sun and live our lives in the dark.            ‘If I stay in the sun for longer than a few minutes it feels like somebody is pouring boiling water over me.            ‘Sam is even affected by low energy light bulbs or fluorescent tubes, we have to remove the bulbs from the ceilings at school so that he has an area where he can sit in darkness.            If they go outside during the day, Ms Taylor and Sam both have to completely cover their exposed skin to avoid suffering an agonising reaction which makes them feel like they are having boiling water poured over them      ‘He lives his life looking up - to make sure he doesn’t get hit by the wrong kind of light.’            The windows in the family’s house and car are specially protected against UV rays and they now have a mobility badge so the family can park in spaces nearest to shops and limit exposure to the sun.            Ms Turner’s daughter Jo, 16, carries the EPP gene but is not light sensitive - meaning she can go outside in the sun without horrendous pain.            Ms Turner said: ‘I thought my children had escaped the condition - until my youngest Sam started having reactions to the light at the age of eight.            WHAT IS ERYTHROPOIETIC PROTOPORHYIA (EEP)?      EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem.      As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood.      As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues.      The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling.      The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation            ‘I was devastated - he’s had to learn to live his life all over again by keeping out of the light.            ‘If the other boys go outside he can’t go with them - he sits in his room playing Play Station.’            At work as a nursery nurse, Ms Turner has a special black tent for when the children go outside to allow her to perform her duties while staying out of UV rays.            She said: ‘Every outing has to be strategically planned - we have to sit at the back of restaurants away from the windows, and we can’t visit swimming pools with glass roofs.            ‘We spend our time skirting round the edge of buildings to avoid the sun - the only place we can go easily is the cinema - because we can just sit in the dark.’            The condition means that the family can’t visit hot countries or spend days outside.            Ms Turner said: ‘The best family holiday we ever had was a cruise, Sam and I could spend our days below deck playing games and activities whilst Jo sprawled in the sunshine.            ‘It’s hard for Sam - it’s something we’ll both have to live with for the rest of our lives.’            The pair have been supported by the British Porphyria Association and now give talks about dealing with the rare condition at their meetings.            Hermione Lawson from The British Skin Foundation said: ‘Erythropoietic protoporphyria, also known as EPP, is a rare skin disease that causes the skin to become oversensitive to sunlight.            ‘When sunlight reaches the skin, either directly or indirectly, it causes tingling, itching or burning, even redness and swelling, and can be very painful.            ‘The condition usually starts in childhood, and although it is a hereditary condition, it is not always passed on from parent to child - so it is not unusual to have just one child with the condition.’            EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood.            Ms Turner's daughter, Jo, does not have the condition and so is not sensitive to sunlight      It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem.            As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood.

The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling.       ||||| Sunny weather gives most people something to smile about, but I long for dark clouds and short days. I suffer from a rare skin condition that means I experience a severe burning sensation when exposed to UV light.      When it happens, my blood feels as though it's boiling and I can't bear anything touching my skin, including clothes. The pain can last for several days and nights, causing severe sleep deprivation. If it's a bad attack, my hands and face swell up. At times it has lasted for weeks.      I'm not even safe inside, because the windows of buildings and cars intensify the rays, and lightbulbs can emit small amounts of UV light, as can television and computer screens. On overcast days, the sun pokes through the clouds; it also reflects off concrete, water and snow.      My two younger sisters also suffer from the condition, and one of my earliest memories is of the three of us huddled in the porch of our house, desperately trying to keep away from the light. We would do anything to hide from the sun, and always wanted the curtains drawn. Our parents couldn't understand it – there were no physical signs of our pain, just some dirty-looking patches on our skin sometimes.      Eventually, when I was eight, a specialist diagnosed me and my sisters with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), a condition caused by a reaction to the combination of our parents' genes. The diagnosis felt like a mixed blessing: it meant we were allowed to wear jeans, long-sleeved blouses and big straw hats to school, and at break we were allowed to stay under a big oak tree, but it also meant the other children made fun of us, knowing we couldn't chase them.      I longed to fit in, and that feeling stayed with me at college. One really sunny day, when all the students went to the park, I decided to risk it and join them. That night, my face swelled up like never before and the pain was unbearable. I was supposed to meet my boyfriend – now my husband – the next day, but I couldn't face him, so I asked a friend to say I was ill. Not surprisingly, it didn't take long for him to realise that my condition could be debilitating.      Later, we wondered whether we should have children, but we went for it and eventually had four. I remember very tentatively taking each of them outside as babies, worrying they had the condition, too. Thankfully, none of them did.      I was determined that they shouldn't suffer because of my condition. But I did struggle to take them out on clear days, and if we went outdoors or in a very light building, I'd have to announce almost as soon as we got there that we couldn't stay long. School sports days and picnics were a nightmare because I had to sit in the shade, often some distance away, and I paid a high price afterwards. Hot holidays were out of the question and we never went to beaches.      Sometimes the condition can be extremely severe. In really bad years, it takes just a few seconds of exposure to set off a reaction, and I never get any warning signs. Sadly, the bad years seem to come more often now, and weeks or even months can pass without my being able to leave the house.      The emotional impact is the worst. While my marriage is strong, not going out much means it's difficult to make friends. When I do go out, I have to wear a big floppy hat, coat, gloves and large sunglasses, which I can't take off even indoors and which make people think I'm peculiar, so they avoid me and often stare. Even my family don't really understand – my daughter gets angry about how I'm dressed.      At home, my only solution has been UV protective film on all my windows. I used to have it in my car, too, but the law bans that now.      Two positive things have happened recently, though: I've been put on daily vitamin D tablets, which have helped with the aching bones caused by its deficiency; and a special protective cream minimises the pain more than anything has before. I have also met others with the condition, through Facebook. There are at least 1,000 people in the UK with EPP and I'm also in touch with sufferers in America. Though UV rays mean I can't stay on the computer for long, it's been wonderful to share experiences. For the first time, I have friends who truly get it.      • As told to Kate Hilpern      Do you have an experience to share?

Write a summary based on this article: At the nation’s top nuclear weapons labs and plants, safety mishaps have imperiled life and limb, and hindered national security operations. This Scientific American story is part of a one-year investigation by reporters at the Center for Public Integrity that reveals many problems and little accountability. In addition to the Nevada accidents, a near-fission calamity in 2011 at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico led to an exodus of nuclear safety engineers and a four-year shutdown of operations crucial to the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Yet penalties for these incidents were relatively light, and many of the firms that run these facilities were awarded tens of millions of dollars in profits—or even new contracts—after major safety lapses occurred.      Not a clue.      The government scientists didn’t know they were breathing in radioactive uranium at the time it was happening. In fact, most didn’t learn about their exposure for months, long after they returned home from the nuclear weapons research center where they had inhaled it.      The entire event was characterized by sloppiness, according to a quiet federal investigation, with multiple warnings issued and ignored in advance, and new episodes of contamination allowed to occur afterward. All of this transpired without public notice by the center.      Here’s how it happened: In April and May 2014, an elite group of 97 nuclear researchers from as far away as the U.K. gathered in a remote corner of Nye County, Nev., at the historic site where the U.S. had exploded hundreds of its nuclear weapons. With nuclear bomb testing ended, the scientists were using a device they called Godiva at the National Criticality Experiments Research Center to test nuclear pulses on a smaller and supposedly safe scale.      But as the technicians prepared for their experiments that spring—under significant pressure to clear a major backlog of work and to operate the machine at what a report called Godiva’s “upper energy range”—they committed several grievous errors, according to government reports.      The machine had been moved to Nevada nine years earlier from Los Alamos, N.M. But a shroud, descriptively called Top Hat, which should have covered the machine and prevented the escape of any loose radioactive particles, was not reinstalled when it was reassembled in 2012.      Also, because Godiva’s bursts tended to set off multiple radiation alarms in the center, the experimenters decided to switch the alarm system off. But because the alarms were connected to the ventilation and air filter system for the room, those were shut off as well. The only ventilation remaining was a small exhaust fan that vented into an adjacent anteroom where researchers gathered before and after experiments.      The Godiva reactor in Nevada released radioactivity accidentally. Credit: U.S. Department of Energy Wikimedia      On June 16, 2014, a month after the experiments were completed, technicians doing routine tests made an alarming discovery—radioactive particles were in the anteroom. They then checked the room holding Godiva, and found radiation 20 times more intense there. The Nevada site’s managers, who work for a group of private, profit-making contractors—like most U.S. nuclear weapons personnel—ordered the rooms decontaminated. But they didn’t immediately check exposures among the scientists and researchers who had gathered for the tests, many of whom had already gone back to their own labs.      None had any clue about the mishap until two months after the experiments, on July 17, when one of them—a researcher from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory nuclear weapons lab in California—got the results from his routine radiation monitoring. His urine tested positive for exposure to enriched uranium particles.      National Security Technologies,, LLC (NSTec), the lead contractor that runs the Nevada site, subsequently collected urine specimens from its own workers who’d been in the room with Godiva during the experiments. It discovered three of its technicians also had inhaled highly-enriched uranium.      News of trouble spread--but only among the scientists and their bosses, who were accustomed to a shroud of official secrecy covering their work. No public announcement was made. According to an initial U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) investigative report dated April 28, 2015, calls eventually went out to test the 97 people present for the Godiva experiments. But for reasons that remain unclear the testing went very slowly, and not until 2016 did the DoE state that 31 were discovered to have inhaled uranium.      In a letter last summer to the Los Alamos and Nevada lab directors, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Administrator Frank Klotz suggested that the employees’ radiation doses were not large—at the high end, they were roughly equivalent to 13 chest x-rays. But once inhaled, uranium particles can keep emitting radiation for years, and so they pose an added cancer risk. Klotz’s letter deemed the exposures “safety-significant and preventable.” It could have been even worse, of course, given the absence of any timely warning.      Lab Operations Riddled with Errors      The four key national facilities involved in the underlying experimentation—Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore, the Nevada Test Site and Sandia National Laboratory—are among the U.S.’s premier scientific labs. They collectively employ more than 26,000 people engaged in cutting-edge and often dangerous work, governed by myriad nuclear safety regulations, with two major contract enforcement mechanisms meant to inflict financial pain when needed on the private corporations that operate them.      And yet in this case, and in others like it, not only were the labs’ procedures and responses riddled with errors, but even after attention was called to these incidents, other safety mishaps occurred. And the financial penalties imposed by the government didn’t seem to have a major impact on the labs’ conduct.      A review by The Center for Public Integrity (CPI) of more than 60 safety mishaps at 10 nuclear weapons–related federal sites that were flagged in special, internal reports to Washington, along with dozens of interviews of officials and experts, revealed a protective system that is weak, if not truly dysfunctional: Fines are frequently reduced or waived while contractors are awarded large profits. Auditors say labs and production plants are overseen by an inadequately staffed NNSA and DoE, which as a result largely rely on the contractors to police themselves.      The CPI probe, partly based on documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveals a system in which extra profit is awarded under a rating profile that persistently places higher priority on the nuclear weapons labs’ national security “mission” than on worker protections, putting production far ahead of safety. Experts say it is a practice in keeping with a culture of urgent, no-holds-barred work that took root in the nuclear weapons complex during World War II. These production pressures flow down to the highly secured rooms where workers labor with special clearances, routinely handling highly toxic and explosive materials.      The DoE typically gives the private companies involved a financial bonus when they accomplish their missions on a deadline, notes Ralph Stanton, one of 16 workers exposed to radiation in an incident at Idaho National Laboratory in 2011. “When the [bonus] milestone is in play”—meaning on the occasions corporate lab operators gain extra pay by meeting production deadlines—some of the workers feel that “safety is completely gone.”      Tracy Bower, a spokesperson for the contractors that operate the Nevada Test Site, said its performance “scores” are high and that “our primary concern has been and continues to be the safety of our employees and our community.”      When the Nevada accident occurred, the Godiva experiments had considerable urgency. After being moved to Nevada from Los Alamos, the machine was originally supposed to resume operations in 2010, near three similar machines inside a tubular-shaped building about the size of two football fields, with a striking white top barely visible aboveground because it is swaddled in compacted earth.      But in August of that year the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, an independent federal safety agency that monitors nuclear weapons operations, warned in a letter (pdf) to NNSA that it was concerned about “deficiencies” at the experimental facility housing Godiva, including potentially unreliable radiation alarms. Neither NNSA nor the site’s private contractor had “conducted sufficiently detailed design reviews of the facility,” the board’s chair, Peter Winokur, wrote.      Godiva’s operation was postponed, but the controlled bursts of radiation were finally restarted in September 2013. That same month the DoE’s Office of Inspector General warned that some safety issues persisted with Godiva, including flaws in some instrumentation related to safety and incomplete documents meant to guide workers safely through their tasks. The inspector general’s report (pdf) also warned that more than a third of the time, when the contractors involved said they had fixed problems flagged by the government, they hadn’t actually done so. The inspector general blamed the delays and problems, in part, on “weaknesses in federal oversight.”      A Workplace Hazardous to Whistle-Blowers      But inadequate supervision from Washington was only part of the problem. According to a separate August 2013 report by the DoE’s workplace health and safety office, the leaders of NSTec were generally inattentive to workers’ safety concerns and resentful of NNSA oversight. Amid a rise in workplace injury and illnesses at the site—which the report did not explain—the contractor had depicted the government’s inquiries about it as an “overreaction.”      The report said that because the contractor did not consistently encourage open communications, frontline workers feared retaliation if they complained to their supervisors about safety issues. It said two such cases of retaliation surfaced during the safety office’s inquiry. Overall, the report said, significant stresses existed on the site’s “safety and security culture” and there were “indications of a chilling effect” on worried workers.      It was against this backdrop that the Godiva contaminations played out over several months the following year. The device is an open-faced, ugly stack of high-tech machinery, shelving and wires that stands as tall as a man. Inside are rings and blocks of highly enriched uranium, a key nuclear explosive; they are made to fission, just slightly, when they are delicately moved closer by at least two technicians.      The point is to generate modest bursts of radiation useful for researching nuclear power, training nuclear safety experts, predicting weapons effects and making bomb components less vulnerable to radiation storms in a nuclear war. Those who gathered for the experiments came from Los Alamos, which oversaw the work; Lawrence Livermore; Sandia; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington State; Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee; the Nevada Field Office of the National Nuclear Security Administration; and the U.K.’s Atomic Weapons Establishment.      In a push to make up for lost time, experimentation on Godiva was placed on an accelerated schedule. As a September 2016 report detailing the NNSA’s review of the contaminations noted, “During April and May 2014, there was an increased campaign of Godiva burst operations, some of which were in the upper energy range of Godiva's capability.”      All the while, with radiation alarms silenced, the particles of uranium were being piped into the main Godiva room and an area where experimenters thought they’d be safe. Although the contamination started showing up in June, it was not until August 7, 2014, that the DoE’s Nevada Field Office at the site shut down Godiva’s operations.      Another 11 days passed before technicians noted even higher contamination levels inside the room that housed the machine. The contractors involved—from Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and the Nevada test site—didn’t determine that this incident merited a formal safety report to Washington for another two weeks.      A spokesperson for NNSA, Greg Wolf, wrote in an e-mail that all the exposure levels were below regulatory limits and posed minimal health risks. He wrote Godiva’s operations are now being closely monitored and that the contractors that run Nevada and Los Alamos “take any unexpected exposure seriously.”      Still, with those types of exposures, “there is some incremental risk that you might get cancer,” said Joel Lubenau, a certified health physicist, industry consultant and former senior adviser to a chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. He said the degree of risk depended on how large the particles were and whether they were soluble enough to enter the bloodstream and reach key organs. He also said he was highly surprised to hear the alarms had been turned off and that the protective shroud was never installed.      No Fines for Repeated Safety Infractions      The fallout from the episode went on for years. On October 21, 2014, four months after the original Godiva leakage, technicians detected excess radioactive particle contamination outside the Flattop critical assembly device, another open-faced radiation-burst machine similar to Godiva, located in an adjacent building.      Contamination also showed up again in the Godiva equipment room. A week later workers shut down Flattop. But oddly, “no formal causal analysis was performed,” according to a 2016 settlement order summarizing DoE investigative findings on the Godiva incident. It was assumed that it was all related to Godiva, the order disclosed.      The settlement order called the Godiva room’s monitoring system inadequate, the hazard controls “insufficiently designed and implemented,” and the management response “slow” and “less than adequate.” But because the NNSA had docked contractors’ profits—87,000 for NSTec and 500,000 for Los Alamos National Security, LLC—due to overall operational shortcomings, it levied no fines specific to the safety infractions.

Credit: U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management      And following a common pattern, these events amounted to only a portion of the documented mishaps at both labs during this period. In September 2013, for example, security personnel at the Nevada site unexpectedly found a trailer full of Los Alamos’s low-level radioactive waste sitting in a parking lot outside Gate 100 of the Nevada site. The trailer had been sent there for disposal but the site had refused to accept it because it lacked appropriate shipping papers describing the trailer’s contents, so it was left in the parking lot for a week.      After an investigation, Los Alamos voluntarily suspended its shipment of low-level waste to Nevada. Due to continuing problems with paperwork, Los Alamos wasn’t cleared to restart its waste shipments to Nevada until September 15, 2014, a full year after the trailer was discovered.      During the same period Los Alamos was sending other, more dangerous waste to the DoE’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, N.M., for underground storage. But in December 2013 one of its subcontractors added organic instead of inorganic material to one of the drums—based on a mistyped transcript of an internal meeting where the waste-packaging requirements were discussed. And in February 2014, after being sent into the bowels of WIPP with the wrong material inside, a drum exploded, sending radioactivity throughout the facility and shutting it down for nearly three years—at an estimated 1.5-billion cost to the government. For that, in 2014 the Los Alamos contractor had its profits cut by 57 million, less than 4 percent of the repair bill.      In that episode the final Accident Investigation Board report (pdf) said supervisors had “fostered a culture where employees do not feel comfortable raising safety issues to management.” Ernest Moniz, secretary of Energy from May 2013 to January 2017, said shortly before leaving that the day the drum exploded at WIPP was by far the worst day of his tenure. Los Alamos, he said in a subsequent interview with CPI, had “inadequate quality control in how they were packaging the wastes. There is no sugarcoating that.”      Moniz also said that during his tenure, there was “a clear pattern” in which the nuclear weapons laboratories were annually ranked more poorly by his department on their “operations” than on their other tasks, with Los Alamos “in particular…the lowest.” He said he had “no doubt they have had some management problems.”      Even after the WIPP debacle, moreover, Los Alamos’ troubles with worker safety were not over. On May 3, 2015, when a worker sprayed cleaning fluid inside a cubicle with high-voltage connections that he thought had been turned off, he caused what’s known as an “arc-flash” explosion that blew him out of the cubicle and burned him over 30 percent of his body. “It caused him enormous suffering,” recalls Don Nichols, who was then the NNSA associate administrator for safety and health. “He made an understandable human error, where controls that should have protected him were not there.”      For these failings and more, NNSA’s then-Principal Deputy Administrator Madelyn Creedon in 2015 cut nearly 6 million from the Los Alamos contractor’s available profit in 2015, and the on-site contracting officer cut another 7.2 million just for the arc-flash. Yet the government still gave the contractor nearly 44 million in profit, or 71 percent of the total available to it.      In 2016, however, it decided to force a new competition for the roughly two billion dollar annual contract to manage the laboratory, a decision that Moniz attributed in the interview to the current contractors’ “operational failure.”      Impunity for Top Managers      David Overskei, a nuclear physicist and consultant in San Diego who has been hired by both the NNSA and its contractors, said, however, that in his view the award of profit based on performance is “having impact—it’s just not having the desired impact.” Instead of driving consistently good behavior, he said, performance-based profits inspire contractors to find ways to meet minimum standards to collect their bonus.      Overskei, who’s analyzed conditions at NNSA sites and led a congressionally chartered study of the NNSA’s management system in 2006, said in a telephone interview that “there need to be consequences when people don’t do their management job, and the consequence needs to be getting fired. That simply doesn’t happen.”      Unsealed nuclear waste drum shows explosion effects. Credit: U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management      He pointed out that even though the NNSA withheld substantial profit from the contractors that operate Los Alamos National Laboratory as well as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant after the 2014 accident there, the top leaders at Los Alamos, where subcontractors made the mistake that caused the radiation-exposure accident, kept their jobs. “In the commercial world, I guarantee you a lot of people would have lost their jobs, and not lower-level people,” Overskei said.      At NSTec, safety problems similarly persisted after the uranium incident. On June 13, 2014, a 55-gallon metal drum containing an explosive chemical blew up as it was being lifted by a worker, sending shrapnel into his leg and even into the tire of a truck some yards away. The worker was blown eight feet out of the shed bay where he was working, leaving him with shrapnel wounds, minor burns to his face and arms, and contusions. An investigation found that isopropyl alcohol in the drum had been transformed by the Nevada desert heat and air into organic peroxides, which are “exceptionally prone to explosive decomposition.”      An accident board determined that the explosion was “wholly preventable” and criticized the contractor team for not having a comprehensive, company-wide chemical safety program, according to the board’s report on June 13,, 2014.      Then, on February 26, 2015, a worker was overexposed to vapors in a degreasing operation. The chemical in question, 1-bromopropane, has been linked to neurological illnesses, cancer and reproductive disorders. An enforcement letter from Steven Simonson, director of the DoE’s Office of Enforcement, to NSTec dated October 6, 2015, said the incident “revealed recurring issues in chemical handling and control” that were also evident during the drum explosion. The letter, however, was just a warning and no fines were imposed.      Four months later, on June 24, 2015, some storage drums containing other chemicals spontaneously erupted in a fire. The drums had been stored in a warehouse but moved to an uncovered pad where the blistering Nevada heat hit 102.4 degrees—“temperatures well in excess” of what is considered safe, an enforcement letter from Simonson to NSTec said. It took almost three hours for the fire to burn itself out.      That letter, dated February 22, 2016, cited both the drum explosion and the fire as evidence of similar safety failures: “Both events resulted from improper storage of hazardous chemicals and a lack of understanding regarding storage and environmental factors that affect chemical stability,” the letter said. Once again, the correspondence expressed concern but levied no fines.      The Nevada contracting consortium—a partnership of Northrup Grumman, AECOM, CH2M Hill and Babcock & Wilcox—has run the site since 2006. On November 14, 2014, the year of the Godiva incident, NSTec had its profit cut by 4.2 million—to 26.4 million, or 86 percent of the maximum available—due to what the NNSA called recurrent, systemic problems such as a lack of transparency and accountability, ineffective operations, and weaknesses in its worker safety and health programs, according to a copy of the government’s payment letter.      The following year NSTec again earned roughly the same amount—26.3 million—in profits, or 90 percent of all that was available. An enforcement notice about the drum explosion, dated August 25, 2015, cited NSTec for multiple failings related to chemical storage and hazards, resulting in four Severity Level I violations and one Severity Level II. But because NSTec had its profits docked for other problems in 2014, NNSA Administrator Klotz levied no safety fines in 2015.      And in 2016 the consortium earned 29.4 million, or 93 percent of what was available that year.      Despite the high performance ratings it gave NSTec, the NNSA announced on May 12, 2017, that Mission Support and Test Services LLC – a consortium of Honeywell, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and Stoller Newport News Nuclear, Inc. – would take over operation of the Nevada site at the end of September as the NSTec contract expires after 11 years. The new contract could span a decade with a total budget of 5 billion if the government awards all extension options. Such options were awarded to NSTec every year that it ran the site.      The consortium that forms NSTec did not bid to keep managing the Nevada site, according to Bower, its spokesperson. She did not explain why. The new group, said NNSA spokesperson Wolf, “was awarded the contract because its proposal was determined to represent the best value to the government over the other offerers.”      NSTec’s run at the site may be extended, however. The shift to a new manager has been delayed by a legal fight about the NNSA’s decision between the winning bidder and a rival group. Until that dispute is resolved, Wolf said, NSTec will continue to operate the site. ||||| Nuclear Negligence      Nuclear Negligence examines safety weaknesses at U.S. nuclear weapon sites operated by corporate contractors.

Question: Question: \\"What was given to Napoleon's force?\\"  Context: \\"Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Napoleon's force, initially known as the Armée d'Angleterre and later as La Grande Armée, was given several key resources and advantages. These include: 1. Careful and invaluable training: The troops at Boulogne received thorough training in preparation for future military operations. This prepared them not only for potential invasion of England but also for various future campaigns. 2. Core formation of La Grande Armée: The men at Boulogne formed the foundation for Napoleon's renowned army, La Grande Armée. 3. Organized structure: The French army was organized into seven corps, with 200,000 men at the start. Each corps was a large field unit containing 36 to 40 cannons and capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. 4. Strong defensive positions: These corps were designed to survive at least a day without support in a strong defensive position, providing the Grande Armée with numerous strategic and tactical options during campaigns. 5. Cavalry reserve: In addition to the main force, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 men. This reserve included two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. 6. Expansion and growth: By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, showcasing its considerable size and strength. 7. Well-equipped and well-trained soldiers: The members of the Grande Armée were provided with proper equipment, training, and competent leadership from experienced officers. Overall, Napoleon's force was given careful training, strategic organization, a strong defensive structure, a dedicated cavalry reserve, and the necessary resources to become an effective and powerful fighting force."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – High-intensity interval training is all the rage, with research suggesting that just a few minutes of all-out sweating could reap the same health benefits as a 45-minute moderate workout, and that's true even for the elderly. The draw is clear—interval training takes less time, after all—but so is the drawback, as the New York Times reports: Pushing ourselves with such intensity even in short bursts can be grueling. But new research out of McMaster University in Ontario suggests that while it's hard, HIIT might not be all that unpleasant, and that when people listen to music while pushing hard, they rather like it. \\"This research tells us that they can actually enjoy it, and they may be more likely to participate in HIIT again if they try it with music,\\" says one researcher, per Psych Central. Reporting in the Journal of Sports Sciences, researchers say they studied 20 young, healthy, and physically active men and women performing HIIT for the first time in two scenarios—one without music, and one with—and that each session was followed an hour later by questionnaires. The volunteers rode stationary bikes, starting with an easy two-minute warmup before four 30-second bursts of all-out pedaling. Turns out that on a scale of 1 to 7, where 7 is \\"I loved it,\\" most ranked the exercise a 5, but their ratings climbed to 6 after they did the training to music. The tunes also made them more likely to continue with the training. Whether these findings would translate to a larger group of people who are more sedentary remains unclear. (Just don't exercise when you're angry.) Article:","output":"High-Intensity Interval Training, or HIIT, is a way of exercising where you work really hard for a short time, then rest, then work hard again. It's like mixing lots of short races into one workout! Some smart people did a study and found out that if you do HIIT, you can get the same good things for your body as if you did a longer, slower workout - even if you're older. That means you can have more time to play or do other fun things. But sometimes, pushing ourselves to work hard can be tough and not always fun. New research from a place called McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, found that HIIT might not be that bad after all, especially if we listen to music while we do it. The people who did the research said, \\"This tells us that people can actually enjoy HIIT, and they may be more likely to do it again if they try it with music.\\" They wrote about their study in the Journal of Sports Sciences. What they did was, they got 20 healthy young men and women to try HIIT for the first time. They did it in two different ways: one without music, and one with music. After each time, the people filled out a questionnaire to tell the researchers how they felt about the workouts. The people in the study used stationary bikes, like the kind you see in a gym. They started with an easy two-minute warmup, and then they pedaled really, really fast for 30 seconds, four times. When they asked the people how much they liked the workout, most of them said they liked it a medium amount, like a 5 out of 7. But when they did the workout with music, they liked it even more, like a 6 out of 7! The music also made them more likely to keep doing the workouts in the future. The researchers aren't sure if these findings would be the same for people who don't exercise a lot, but it's a good start. So, if you want to try HIIT and make it more fun, just turn up your favorite tunes and dance, run, or pedal away! Just remember, don't exercise when you're angry - it's better to be happy while working out."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Magna Carta edition found in Sandwich archive scrapbook      Magna Carta has been on display at the Houses of Parliament      Continue reading the main story Related Stories      An early edition of Magna Carta has been found in a Victorian scrapbook during a search of a council's archives      The discovery has come months ahead of the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta in Runnymede in 1215.      Kent archivist Dr Mark Bateson had been asked to search for another charter from the town of Sandwich.      Dr Bateson found the town's Charter of the Forest in a Victorian scrapbook in Kent County Council archives - with the long-forgotten Magna Carta edition.      The document was ripped with about a third missing but could still be worth up to £10m, according to Professor Nicholas Vincent, a specialist in medieval history from the University of East Anglia.      Its high value comes from the fact that it was found with the Charter of the Forest. The only other such pair - dating from 1300 - in the world is owned by Oriel College, Oxford.      Many pictures show King John signing Magna Carta at Runnymede - although experts agree it was sealed      Professor Vincent, who asked Dr Bateson to search for the forest charter in December and went on to authenticate the Sandwich Magna Carta after it was found, said it was \\"a fantastic discovery\\".      He said it backed the theory that Magna Carta was issued more widely than previously thought, to at least 50 cathedral towns and ports.      He also said the discovery gave hope that further copies would also turn up.      Twenty-four editions of Magna Carta, which established the principle of the rule of law, are currently known to exist.      The Magna Carta Research Project describes the Sandwich document as a \\"previously unknown exemplar of the 1300 Magna Carta\\", over half a metre in length, but missing text and its royal seal.      What was Magna Carta?      Magna Carta at Salisbury Cathedral dates from 1215, one of four of the first documents that are still around      Magna Carta outlined basic rights with the principle that no-one was above the law, including the king      It charted the right to a fair trial, and limits on taxation without representation      It inspired a number of other documents, including the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      Only three clauses are still valid - the one guaranteeing the liberties of the English Church; the clause confirming the privileges of the City of London and other towns; and the clause that states that no free man shall be imprisoned without the lawful judgement of his equals      Why are there so many Magna Cartas?      Experts said the 1300 Magna Carta was issued by Edward I and was apparently the last to be drawn up. They said the discovery of the Sandwich Magna Carta brought to seven the number of surviving originals of 1300.      It is understood Sandwich does not plan to sell its copy but does hope to benefit from it as a tourist attraction.      Paul Graeme, mayor of Sandwich Town Council, said owning the forest charter and Magna Carta was \\"an immense privilege\\".      He said: \\"Through the American Declaration of Independence, continuing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Magna Carta still underpins individual liberties worldwide.      \\"To own such a document - and the Charter of the Forest - is an honour and a great responsibility.\\"      This week, four 1215 versions were brought together at the Houses of Parliament; two from Salisbury Cathedral and Lincoln Cathedral and two from the British Library. ||||| An edition of Magna Carta which could be worth up to £10 million has been found after it lay forgotten in a council's archives. The discovery of the version of the historical parchment which established the principle of the rule of law, in the files of the history department of Kent County Council, has been described as an important historical find by an expert.      The document was found in the archives kept in Maidstone but belonging to the town of Sandwich. Speaking from Paris, Professor Nicholas Vincent, of the University of East Anglia, who authenticated the document, said: \\"It is a fantastic discovery which comes in the week that the four other known versions were brought together at the Houses of Parliament. It is a fantastic piece of news for Sandwich which puts it in a small category of towns and institutions that own a 1300 issue.\\"      Prof Vincent said the fact Sandwich had its own Magna Carta gives backing to the theory that it was issued more widely than previously thought to at least 50 cathedral towns and ports. And he added the discovery gives him hope that further copies will also turn up.      There are only 24 editions of the Magna Carta in known existence around the world.      Prof Vincent said: \\"It must have been much more widely distributed than previously thought because if Sandwich had one... the chances are it went out to a lot of other towns. And it is very likely that there are one or two out there somewhere that no one has spotted yet.\\"      Prof Vincent, who specialises in medieval history, said the value of the Sandwich edition could be up to £10 million, but it was ripped with about a third missing. He said: \\"This would be an upper value as it has, like the town of Sandwich, suffered over time from French invasions and the like.\\"      The discovery was made by archivist Dr Mark Bateson at the end of December just before the 800th anniversary year celebrations of King John's concession. The Sandwich Magna Carta was found when Prof Vincent asked Dr Bateson to look up a copy of the town's original Charter of the Forest.      It was found next to the charter in a Victorian scrapbook and its high value comes from the fact it also comprises the Forest Charter. There is only one other such pair in the world, owned by Oriel College, Oxford. It is understood that Sandwich does not intend to sell its Magna Carta but instead is hoping to benefit from its potential as a tourist attraction.      Paul Graeme, mayor of Sandwich Town Council, said: \\"On behalf of Sandwich Town Council, I would like to say that we are absolutely delighted to discover that an original Magna Carta and original Charter of the Forest, previously unknown, are in our ownership.      \\"To own one of these documents, let alone both, is an immense privilege given their international importance. Perhaps it is fitting that they belong to a town where Thomas Paine lived, who proposed in his pamphlet Common Sense a Continental Charter for what were then the American colonies, 'answering to what is called the Magna Carta of England... securing freedom and property to all men, and ... the free exercise of religion'.\\"      He added: \\"Through the American Declaration of Independence, continuing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Magna Carta still underpins individual liberties worldwide. To own such a document - and the Charter of the Forest - is an honour and a great responsibility.\\"      The four known 1215 editions are from Salisbury Cathedral, Lincoln Cathedral and two held at the British Library. They were brought together for a one-day exhibition at Parliament for a crowd of 2,015 chosen by a public ballot.      Speaking of the exhibition, the Lord Speaker, Baroness D'Souza, said: \\"Magna Carta established the principle of the rule of law and equality before the law; for 800 years we have been influenced by its contents and it remains one of the most important political documents in the world, with countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada tracing constitutional influences back to Magna Carta.      The Speaker, Rt Hon John Bercow MP, said: \\"Over the past eight centuries the public and their Parliament have shaped society and changed the way we live our lives. The sealing of the Magna Carta in 1215 and the Montfort parliament of 1265 marked the start of the journey towards modern rights and representation, paving the way for the House of Commons and democracy as we know it today.\\"      The parchment, which was issued by Edward I in 1300, is the final version of Magna Carta and three of its clauses remain on the statute books today. These include the defence of the church, the protection of the City of London and the right to trial by jury.      The first Magna Carta was drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and agreed by King John on June 15, 1215 to make peace with a group of rebel barons. It was reissued and reaffirmed on many occasions in subsequent years. |||||Summary:","output":"A very special old paper called the \\"Magna Carta\\" was found in a special book in a town called Sandwich in England. This paper is over 700 years old and is very important because it has special rules on it that help people have fair laws and protect their rights. The Magna Carta is so important that it helped make other important papers like the United States Constitution, which helps run the United States of America. People think this old paper could be worth a lot of money, like 10 million pounds! But the town of Sandwich wants to keep it and maybe show it to people who come visit their town.

This was followed by stints with The Dingoes (1973–1976), various solo projects (1978–80), Cold Chisel (1983–84) and Jimmy Barnes Band (1984–85). In 1969, Glass scored the role of Berger in the original Australian stage production of Hair, and performed on the award-winning original cast recording. After leaving that production, in the early 1970s (with David Pepperell he founded the pioneering Melbourne import record store \\"Archie & Jughead\\". In 1977 Glass established a new store and record label, Missing Link, which re-issued Cam-Pact material including a compilation album, Psychedelic Pop 'n' Soul 1967-69 (October 2002) alongside many other notable releases, including the earliest recordings by The Go-Betweens and The Birthday Party. Chris Löfvén became a film maker, creating pioneering Australian \\"film clips\\" (music videos) for Daddy Cool and Spectrum; he also directed a feature film, Oz (1976), alongside his continuing music work (often with Keith Glass). Russell Smith co-founded progressive rockers Company Caine (1970–75) and was also (with Arnott) a member of the short-lived Mighty Kong. Stockley was a founding member of early Australian \\"supergroup\\" Axiom (1969–71) and The Dingoes (1973–1978, 2009–present). Robert Lloyd went on to study and teach music and become a successful composer, poet, songwriter and recording artist.  Passage 3:Beechey began racing at the age of 22 in a Ford Customline V8. He came to prominence only a year later when he won the Olympic Touring Car Race at Albert Park, a support event at the Australian Grand Prix meeting which was held in conjunction with the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. As the expense of running this and two subsequent Customline V8s proved too prohibitive he reverted to a Holden 48-215 in 1959. After becoming part of David McKay’s Scuderia Veloce team he again returned to V8s, developing a Chevrolet Impala with which he won the New South Wales Touring Car Championship at Catalina Park. He progressed to a Ford Galaxie owned by Len Lukey and was then instrumental in forming the Neptune Racing Team in 1964. He raced a Holden EH S4 as part of that team alongside Jim McKeown’s Lotus Cortina and Peter Manton’s Morris Cooper S. He subsequently developed and raced a series of V8 powered Touring Cars with which he contested the Australian Touring Car Championship and other events. The first Ford Mustang to race in Australia was followed by a Chevrolet Chevy II Nova, a Chevrolet Camaro, a Holden Monaro GTS 327 and a Holden Monaro GTS 350.

Please add spaces between words: Whenthehumanfertilization,whichflowedintotheseafromtheland,helps,increasingtheamountofplanktonfurther.","output":"When the human fertilization, which flowed into the sea from the land, helps, increasing the amount of plankton further. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of what this statement is trying to convey, let me break it down and explain each segment. 1. \\"When the human fertilization\\": This phrase refers to human-induced nutrient input, specifically fertilizers, which are used to improve crop yield and growth in agriculture. Fertilizers typically contain high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, among other essential nutrients, to support plant growth. 2. \\"which flowed into the sea from the land\\": This phrase highlights the movement of the fertilizers from land to the sea. This transfer typically occurs due to runoff, where excess water carries the nutrients along with it as it makes its way into rivers, estuaries, and eventually the ocean. 3. \\"helps\\": The term \\"helps\\" suggests that the flow of nutrients is contributing positively to a process. In this context, we can assume that it is referring to the growth and increase of plankton populations. 4. \\"increasing the amount of plankton further\\": This phrase indicates that the addition of nutrients from human-produced fertilizers is causing a significant increase in the abundance of plankton in the ocean. Considering these different phrases, the statement essentially means: Human-induced nutrient input, specifically in the form of fertilizers, is carried from the land where it has been applied, through runoff into rivers and estuaries, eventually finding its way to the ocean. This nutrient-rich input serves to boost the growth and increase the overall population of plankton in the sea. This increase in plankton could have ecological and environmental implications, such as a potential boost in the food chain, where plankton serves as a primary food source for a multitude of marine organisms. However, it's worth noting that excessive nutrient input and the resulting increase in plankton populations can lead to harmful algal blooms, oxygen depletion in certain areas, and other negative consequences for marine ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What did the freehold lease?\\" is in \\"Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland. Needing money, James I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre (16,000 m2) mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to \\"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S.

The tobacco which is used to make cigarettes was first grown in what is now part of the United States. Christopher Columbus, who discovered America, saw the Indians smoking. Soon the dried leaves were transported to Europe. In the late 1800s, the Turks made cigarettes popular. Cigarette smoke contains at least two harmful substances, tar and nicotine. Tar, which forms as the tobacco burns, damages the lungs and therefore affects breathing. Nicotine, which is found in the leaves, causes the heart to beat faster and increases the breathing rate. Nicotine in large can kill a person by stopping a person's breathing muscles. Smokers usually take in small amounts that the body can quickly break down. Nicotine can make new smokers feel dizzy  or sick to their stomachs. The heart rate for young smokers increases 2 to 3 beats per minute. Nicotine also lowers skin temperature and reduces blood flow in the legs and feet. It plays an important role in increasing smokers' risk of heart disease and stroke. Smoking cigarettes is dangerous. Cigarette smoking was the cause of lung cancer and several other deadly diseases. The following effects are caused by Nicotine EXCEPT that   _  .

At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes. It would be their final conversation.

That's when their journey from Portland to Boston ended.  Now, to know how long it took them to reach Boston, we need to see the difference between when they started and when they finished. They started at 6:00 and finished at 6:45. So, it took them 45 minutes to reach Boston. Now we need to decide if \\"Three quarters of an hour\\" is the right answer. Well, we know that one hour has 60 minutes, and three-quarters of an hour is like cutting the hour into four equal parts and taking three of those parts. When we do that, we get 45 minutes.

It was written, composed, and produced by Morissette herself, and released as the album's lead single on 8 February 2002. It is a pop rock song, featuring a shuffling, largely acoustic-rock framework. Lyrically, \\"Hands Clean\\" caused controversy, since it is reportedly the singers recollection of a forbidden sexual relationship she shared with a much older man when she was approximately 14 years of age.  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American alternative rock singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actress. Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s, with two commercially successful dance-pop albums. Afterwards, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, and in 1995 released \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", a more rock-oriented album which sold more than 33 million units globally and is her most critically acclaimed work. Her following album, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\", was released in 1998.  - \\"Precious Illusions\\" is a song written, recorded and produced by Alanis Morissette, for her fifth album \\"Under Rug Swept\\" (2002). It released as the album's second and final international single on 5 August 2002. Its lyrics describe a conflict between idealism and realism, and its protagonist refers to her childhood fancies as \\"precious illusions\\" that she has distanced herself from with a feeling that reminds her of \\"parting with an imaginary friend\\".  - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions.  - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Under Rug Swept is the fifth studio album and third internationally released album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released by Maverick Records in the United States on February 26, 2002 and in the United Kingdom a day earlier (see 2002 in music), it was the first album Morissette had written and produced all on her own. It debuted at number one on charts in 12 countries, including the United States and Canada, and produced the singles \\"Hands Clean\\" and \\"Precious Illusions\\". Sales, however, did not match those of Morissette's previous two studio albums.  - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - \`\` Utopia '' is a pop rock song written by Alanis Morissette , and produced by her for her fifth album , Under Rug Swept ( 2002 ) .  - Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records. Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch.

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"In the given question, there are two aspects to consider: the availability of more water due to increased rainfall, and the second effect mentioned, which is the process of mixing pancake mix with water.  The increased rainfall would result in more water available for various uses, including mixing pancake batter. However, the actual effect on the amount of water used in the pancake mix would depend on several factors. If there is more rain and it results in a significant increase in the overall availability of water for the general population, it may lead to people being less restrictive with their water usage. Consequently, they might use more water while mixing the pancake batter, potentially leading to a thinner or less consistent batter. In this case, the effect on the second step mentioned in the process (mixing pancake mix with water) would be more significant due to increased availability of water. On the other hand, if the increase in rainfall doesn't have a substantial impact on the overall availability of water, it may not influence the amount of water used for pancake mix. People might still be cautious with their water usage and adhere to the recommended ratio of pancake mix and water. In this scenario, the effect of increased rainfall on the pancake mix-water ratio would be minimal or have no effect. Now, let's consider the supposed perturbation, which implies an unexpected or sudden change in the process or the system. The mention of a perturbation within the context of the question suggests a change in the overall availability of rainfall or water and how it may affect the second step in the process, i.e., mixing pancake mix with water. Assuming that the perturbation results in a sudden increase in rainfall and water availability, it could lead to a consequent increase in water usage while mixing the pancake batter, as explained earlier. This additional water could, in turn, influence the texture and overall outcome of the pancakes, making them less consistent or thinner than desired. However, if the perturbation doesn't have a significant impact on water availability, it would have minimal or no effect on the pancake mix-water ratio. In other words, the increased rainfall would not affect the second step, and the preparation of pancakes would continue as usual. In conclusion, the effect of increased rainfall on the amount of water used for pancake mix depends on various factors, primarily the actual availability of water and how people adjust their water usage accordingly. If there is a considerable increase in water availability due to the perturbation, it could lead to more water usage in the pancake mix. Conversely, if the perturbation doesn't have a significant influence on water availability, it would lead to no effect or minimal effect on the pancake mix-water ratio."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Library[edit] In the wrap-around story of the film, H. P. Lovecraft (Jeffrey Combs) learns of a monastery where a copy of the Necronomicon is held. Having been a regular there for his research, he sets up an appointment, his cab driver told to wait outside. Taking insult when the head monk calls his work \\"fiction\\", Lovecraft insists that all his writings are true. Requesting to read the Alchemical Encyclopedia Vol. III, Lovecraft steals a key from another monk and flees to the cellar where the Necronomicon is being held. Unknown to him, a monk has seen him. Unlocking the vault where the book is held, the door closes behind Lovecraft unexpectedly, making him drop the key down a grating and into the water below. As that happens, one of the seals is opened. Lovecraft sits to read and record what he is reading. It's not specified if he sees visions of the future through the book, or if the book contains future accounts. It's likely the stories will come to pass, and for the Necronomicon have already passed, alluding to the Necronomicon's timelessness, as all the stories take place well beyond the 1920s. The Drowned[edit] Edward De LaPoer, a member of the De La Poer family, is tracked down in Sweden after inheriting an old, abandoned family hotel. Left a sealed envelope from Jethro De La Poer, he learns of his uncle's tragic death. Upon a boat trip return to New England, a crash on the shore killed Jethro's wife and son.

Choices:  - library - drawer - dentist - bed - airport  The rationale to choose \\"bed\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","output":"Bed The rationale for choosing \\"bed\\" as the answer to the question \\"Where do young boys hide dirty magazines?\\" lies in the understanding of human behavior, particularly that of young boys who attempt to keep their possession of explicit material hidden and private. Out of the listed options, \\"bed\\" is the most plausible hiding place for such items for several reasons. 1. Privacy: A young boy's bedroom is widely regarded as their personal domain, a space associated with their belongings and preferred activities. The bed, in turn, plays an important role in the formation of emotional comfort and a sense of ownership. By hiding the magazines under the bed or within the bedding, the young boy believes he can secure their concealment and protect his privacy. 2. Accessibility: In maintaining a hidden stash of dirty magazines, it is crucial for the young boy to access them when desired without arousing suspicion. A bed presents a convenient location as it is both a private and easily accessible spot. Many beds may have a gap beneath them or bedding with pockets in which magazines can be stored and retrieved with minimal effort. 3. Familiarity: The young boy is well-acquainted with his room and its contents, possessing knowledge of its nooks and crannies that others may not be aware of. Utilizing this familiarity, a child conceals such materials in places they believe to be obscure and unknown to others, often resorting to the vicinity of their bed. 4. Sense of control: The fear of being discovered is a constant concern for the young individual with such magazines. Hiding them under or near the bed allows for an element of control over their secret, as they can monitor their belongings closely and take action to move them if necessary. While the other options presented - library, drawer, dentist, and airport - offer unique scenarios, they do not align with the reasons mentioned above. A library, dentist, or airport would be public spaces that do not provide the necessary privacy and personal control for a young boy to hide explicit content. A drawer, although within the confines of the child's room, may still be easily accessible by others and is a rather apparent hiding spot that does not satisfy the need for secrecy. In conclusion, the rationale behind choosing \\"bed\\" as the answer to the question \\"Where do young boys hide dirty magazines?\\" is rooted in the understanding of privacy, accessibility, familiarity, and control intrinsic to human behavior. These factors collectively make the area around the bed the most plausible choice for a young boy to conceal such material."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Image copyright AFP Image caption Anna Iriyama was one of two AKB48 members injured in Sunday's attack      Two members of popular Japanese pop group AKB48 were injured after a man attacked them with a saw.      Rina Kawaei, 19, and Anna Iriyama, 18, were meeting with fans in the northern city of Takizawa on Sunday when a man lunged forward and slashed them.      They sustained cuts on their hands and heads, reported Kyodo. A male staff member was also cut on his hand.      The group holds the Guinness record for being the world's largest pop group.      The police have arrested the 24-year-old man, identified as Satoru Umeta.      AKB48's manager was reported as saying the two girls' surgery was successful and they would be able to leave the hospital by Monday.      A Tokyo concert scheduled for Monday night and other fan events have been cancelled.      News of the attack was covered widely in national media. AKB48, which was founded in 2005, is hugely popular in Japan and other Asian countries.      Image copyright AFP Image caption Rina Kawaei, seen here in a June 2013 photo, reportedly suffered injuries to her right thumb      AKB stands for Akihabara, the technology district of Tokyo, where the group has its own theatre. Members perform there almost every day.      The number 48 reportedly refers to the original number of members in the group, although it has since expanded.      The current line-up on the group's website, spread over four main teams and other smaller ones, lists 140 names.      Every year tens of thousands of fans vote on who gets to join the group from a pool of more than 200 candidates, in an event that is widely covered by national media.      Members have to abide by strict rules set by their management, and are not allowed to date.      The band made international headlines last year when one of its members, Minami Minegishi, shaved her head and apologised to fans in a video posted online. She had been caught spending a night with her boyfriend.      The incident sparked debate on whether pop idols in Japan have the right to lead normal lives. ||||| Staff members are seen at a fan event site where members of Japanese girls' pop group AKB48 were stabbed in Takizawa, Iwate prefecture, in this photo taken by Kyodo May 25, 2014.      TOKYO (Reuters) - A man wielding a saw slashed and injured two members of Japanese female pop group AKB48, rated by Guinness as the world's biggest such group, at a fan event in Japan, leaving the country stunned at the extremely rare violent crime.      The group, known for its perky routines, was shaking hands with fans at a meet-and-greet function on Sunday, when the man attacked them with a weapon described variously as a 50-cm (20-inch)-long saw or a hatchet, Japanese media said.      \\"This sort of thing is unimaginable,\\" one fan told Japanese television. \\"I'm in shock.\\"      Group members Rina Kawaei,19, and Anna Iriyama, 18, received emergency surgery for cut and broken fingers, with Iriyama also suffering cuts to the face, media said.      \\"The surgery ended successfully and their condition is stable,\\" their manager said. \\"They should be able to leave hospital tomorrow.\\"      A male staff member received cuts to his hand.      Police arrested a 24-year-old high school dropout for attempted murder after the event, in the northeastern city of Takizawa, was interrupted by screams of \\"Stop!\\" and \\"No!\\"      There were no bag checks, and fans have said most of the group's events have only cursory checks at best, prompting newspapers to call for tighter security. The incident featured on several newspaper front pages and television shows.      Security checks tend to be light in Japan, which has stiff gun control laws, and violent crime involving weapons is rare.      AKB48, founded in 2005, is known for its high \\"kawaii,\\" or cuteness, quotient, and all its members are in their teens or early 20s.      Fans vote each year to determine 64 of the most popular girls from a 237-member pool, who then rotate in and out of four main troupes and several affiliated groups, based on their popularity.      The \\"AKB\\" in the group's name is a reference to Akihabara, Tokyo's high-tech mecca, where it has a theatre. They are also popular overseas, with a sister group based in Jakarta.      Every year fans elect the most popular members of the group, obtaining a ballot by buying the group's latest CD. Some hard-core fans buy hundreds to give their favourite a boost.      A Tokyo concert by the group scheduled for Monday night has been cancelled, as have other meet-and-greets, their management company said on its website.

She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades.

A strengthening El Nino is expected to bring torrential rain Thursday to parts of Southern California, including Los Angeles, and authorities warned of possibly severe mudslides in areas denuded by forest fires. The storm could dump 8 inches to 10 inches of rain on the Los Angeles area and higher amounts in the foothills, the National Weather Service said. Late Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa -- expecting a dangerous storm Wednesday -- urged hundreds of Californians to leave their homes. A torrential rainfall Tuesday unleashed flooding and spawned a rare tornado warning.  Are you being affected by the storms? Send your images, video. There has been some resistance to the advice, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department said.

Which inventor was known as ‘The Wizard of Menlo Park’????","output":"The inventor known as \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park\\" is Thomas Alva Edison, who was born on February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio, and passed away on October 18, 1931, in West Orange, New Jersey. This nickname is a reference to Edison’s laboratory and research facility, which was located in the village of Menlo Park in New Jersey (now part of the city of Edison). The name was given to him by a newspaper reporter, who was impressed by Edison’s vast array of inventions and the innovative environment he created in his laboratory. Thomas Edison was a prolific inventor and businessman whose inventions and contributions had a significant impact on the world. Over his lifetime, he held more than 1,000 U.S. patents, as well as numerous patents in other countries. Among his most famous and influential inventions are the electric light bulb, the phonograph, and the motion-picture camera. These inventions played a key role in shaping the modern world and have become integral to our everyday lives. Edison's process of invention involved not only his individual genius but also the collaborative efforts of a dedicated team. He established the first industrial research laboratory in Menlo Park, where he brought together skilled engineers, technicians, and scientists to work on various projects. This model of innovation through teamwork and collaboration has become a fundamental part of modern research and development. In addition to his well-known inventions, Edison made strides in various industries. He improved the telegraph and telephone systems, developed an alkaline storage battery, created an electric power distribution system, and worked on countless other projects. His tireless work in multiple fields earned him various accolades, including the title of \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park,\\" as his inventions seemed almost magical to people of his time. Edison's impact on the world went beyond his inventions; he founded and was involved in several companies, most notably the Edison Electric Light Company and the General Electric Company, both of which have grown into major corporations today. His groundbreaking work has had a lasting impact on various fields, including communication, entertainment, and energy. Thomas Edison's legacy as \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park\\" lives on through the countless lives he's touched and transformed with his inventions and innovations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: Are multi-label CNNs trained using images containing multiple lables? Question 2: Which one is best among these dual booting or vmware and why? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer your two questions individually, let's break them down and analyze them step-by-step. Question 1: Are multi-label CNNs trained using images containing multiple labels? Step 1: Identify the main topic in the question. The main topic here is \\"multi-label CNNs\\" (Convolutional Neural Networks). Step 2: Understand the query. In this case, the question is about the type of images used in training. Step 3: Provide the answer. Multi-label CNNs are indeed trained using images containing multiple labels. This is because these networks are designed to identify and classify multiple objects within an image, rather than focusing on just a single object as it is the case in single-label CNNs. Question 2: Which one is best among these dual booting or VMware and why? Step 1: Identify the main topic. In this case, the main topic is the comparison between \\"dual booting\\" and \\"VMware.\\" Step 2: Understand the query. The question asks for the better choice between the two options and a justification for the choice. Step 3: Provide the answer. The choice between dual booting and VMware (or any other virtualization software) depends on your specific needs and preferences. Dual booting allows you to run two separate operating systems on your computer, which may provide better performance and a more native experience for the secondary OS. However, switching between the two systems requires a reboot. VMware, on the other hand, uses virtual machines to run multiple operating systems simultaneously but may use more system resources and could lead to less optimal performance. Your choice should be based on whether you prioritize performance/native experience (dual booting) or the convenience of running multiple OSs simultaneously without rebooting (VMware). Now, to determine if the answers to these questions would be the same, we need to analyze their topics and context.  Step 1: Compare the topics of the questions. - Question 1 discusses Multi-label CNNs and their training. - Question 2 compares dual booting and VMware in terms of usage and preferences. Step 2: Determine if there is any overlap between these topics. - There is no apparent overlap between these topics. One is related to artificial intelligence and image classification, while the other revolves around operating systems and virtualization. Based on this analysis, the answers to these two questions would not be the same, as they address unrelated subjects and inquiries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: By Mike Lopresti, Gannett News Service BEIJING  So the Olympic message gets muted, and the symbolic doves were barely out of the stadium. Peace and brotherhood are the goals here, and not just winning the discus and badminton. An extraordinary Opening Ceremony had told us so. And now there is a murder to investigate. We are not sure yet why the American volleyball coach's father-in-law had to die in front of his family Saturday, when all he wanted was be another tourist at the Beijing Drum Tower. Someone stabbed him to death barely five miles from the Olympic flame. Two more were injured, his wife seriously so. The killer committed suicide, using a tower leap as his exit. Suddenly, the Olympics did not seem quite as happy, or quite as safe. But we don't yet know why. The crowds were barely seated at the first round of events when the news spread Saturday. The word reached as far as the Great Wall, where the cycling road race was finishing. This is what the Olympics are supposed to be on their first day, riders grinding through the Juyongguan Pass where Genghis Khan used to roam. Not crime scenes. For the record, Beijing now has as many victims of violence as Atlanta. A lousy number to share. The motive is still not understood. Can we agree on what we're all thinking? Did some Beijing head case go out looking for Americans? If not that, more routine answers might have to be explored. Robbery. Madness? Simply the urge to kill? China has not seen much trouble of this sort. The man might have taken his twisted rationale with him when he jumped. It seemed unfathomable, regardless of reason. This is a city with security on red alert, and police on every corner. You can't swing a shopping bag without hitting soldiers marching down the street. Somewhere out there, too, are missiles and helicopters and metal detectors. All that, and one man kills another in broad daylight, at a busy landmark. The Chinese have been desperately waiting on the sun for their Olympics. But here came a dark cloud. Should we be afraid now, or just sad at how quickly bad news can strike, 12 hours after the fireworks closed a stirring Opening Ceremony? There was such a strong message Friday night about sport's place in a better world. Obviously, one future killer was not paying attention. Something quickly comes to mind about this assault; Beijing's chosen slogan for its Games. \\"One world, one dream.\\" We are all in this together, is the general idea. More alike than we know. And here, suddenly, is bloody proof. A story with such malice might be rare in China, but it is nothing new on the other side of the world. In the USA, the story of a senseless fatal attack followed by a suicide leap would hardly qualify as news. On Saturday, then, China looked an awful lot like us. This is probably not the one world the Olympic hosts had in mind. They must be mortified by the act. No expense has been spared in energy or cash to put on this gala. China has tried to woo the world with its contented masses, and now one sick soul has made his own headlines. By Saturday evening, there was sand spread on the pavement near the scene, presumably where the killer leapt to his death. An 800-year-old tower had become part of the Beijing Games, and also part of America's view of them. The Olympics go on, though. The USA meets Venezuela Sunday, with an unexpected dose of poignancy. Meantime, the Chinese police have a case to crack. Garden variety street crime, or terrorist attack? It'd certainly be good to know.

But bet you don't know why \\"Gemütlichkeit\\" is untranslatable (let alone unpronounceable), what false teeth were doing in the lost property bin last year and whether the yodeling or oompah tent would best suit your personality. Read on, Lieblings. Bavaria's biggest beer love-in kicks off in Munich on Saturday, September 21, and runs through October 6. 1. Gird your bosom, hitch those hosen Worried that squeezing into a bosom-lifting dirndl or a pair of skin-tight lederhosen will make you look ridiculous? Bavarian bonding is about sing-alongs, and one such tune you'll hear time and again at the festival is \\"Ein Prosit der","output":"Gemütlichkeit.\\" Or simply \\"A toast to Gemütlichkeit.\\" The term \\"Gemütlichkeit\\" does not have a direct translation in English, but it is associated with a sense of well-being, comfort, and conviviality, which come as an integral part of Oktoberfest's atmosphere. Conveying much more than the loose interpretations of 'cosiness' or 'conviviality'; this word is at the heart of Bavarian attitudes to socializing. So don't worry about how you look; Oktoberfest is all about Gemütlichkeit. One fun fact about Oktoberfest; you might be surprised at the number of strange items that get lost and end up in the lost & found each year. Among last year's findings were not only countless IDs, wallets, and phones, but also more peculiar items including false teeth. It might seem strange, but with the relaxed, convivial atmosphere and perhaps a beer too many, the festival-goers sometimes end up misplacing some of the most unexpected items.  When it comes to the musical choice of the Oktoberfest, it largely depends on personal preferences. If you have a fondness for traditional folk music, then the yodeling tent is the place for you. Yodeling has a long history in Bavarian culture and offers an unconventional, joyful musical experience for those interested.  On the other hand, if you prefer rhythmic, catchy music that can carry on the night and make you sway in no time, an oompah tent is the right choice for you. Oompah bands, characterized by their unique deep brass sound, are a staple of any Bavarian festivity. The lively beats of oompah music will undoubtedly keep you in high spirits throughout the night.  The main thing to remember is, whether you're donning a dirndl or lederhosen, whether you choose yodeling or oompah, Oktoberfest is about embracing and enjoying Bavarian culture in all its facets. It's about laughter, camaraderie, hearty food, and, of course, great beer.  Join the festival from Saturday, September 21, and experience the very essence of Oktoberfest by girding your bosom or hitching your lederhosen. The exceptional quality of Bavarian beer, the infectious cheeriness of the crowd, and the fascinating traditions will guarantee unforgettable memories.

Answer the following question: Information:  - An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device. Electric motors give electric cars instant torque, creating strong and smooth acceleration. They are also around three times as efficient as cars with an internal combustion engine. The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s. Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in internal combustion engines, electric starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles. The energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s brought a short-lived interest in electric cars; although those cars did not reach the mass marketing stage, as became the case in the 21st century.  - Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. is an Italian car manufacturer, founded as A.L.F.A.

The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability.  - Engineers design materials, structures, and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The word \\"engineer (\\"from the Latin \\"ingeniator\\"\\")\\" is derived from the Latin words \\"ingeniare\\" (\\"to contrive, devise\\") and \\"ingenium\\" (\\"cleverness\\").

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: South Korea Launches Plan to Drive Out Older Cars SEOUL—South Korea has announced stricter emissions standards for vehicles starting next year, as part of efforts to clean up the air in its major cities. The Ministry of Environment said Thursday that old diesel-powered vehicles weighing 2.5 tons or more will be banned from Seoul if they aren’t equipped with an emission-reducing device or a low-pollution engine. The ban will be extended to Incheon and 17 other cities in Gyeonggi province in 2018, and to the remaining metropolitan areas in 2020. A diesel car produced before 2005 emits eight times more bad gases than the latest models that meet the toughened Euro 6 standards, the ministry said in a statement. About 1.04 million vehicles will be subject to the regulations. Cars that violate the regulations will be fined 200,000 won (180) per detection, it said. The ministry said it would help partially finance the costs needed for low-income drivers and smaller firms to buy the latest diesel cars or equip their vehicles with emission-reducing devices. Diesel-powered vehicles have risen in popularity in Korea in recent years, largely because of better fuel efficiency than gasoline-powered cars and a shift in consumer appetite to sport-utility vehicles. Diesel cars account for more than half of newly registered vehicles in Korea. The latest measures come after Korea in May found that some diesel vehicles emitted up to 21 times more nitrogen oxides on the roads than at laboratories in tests conducted in the wake of Volkswagen AG VLKAY 1.69 % ’s admission last year that it falsified U.S. emissions tests on some diesel-powered cars. On Tuesday, Korea banned the sale of almost all Volkswagen cars after revoking the certifications of 80 models and handed down heavy fines, saying the German auto maker faked documents on emissions and noise-level tests. Following the Volkswagen scandal, the country has taken a series of measures to address growing public concerns about air pollution, with a view to bringing its air quality to the levels of some advanced European countries. Last month, the government said it will cut consumption taxes for consumers who turn in diesel-engine cars that are at least 10 years old when purchasing a new car. Korea also plans to spend 5 trillion won (4.48 billion) by 2020 to have more green cars on the road and improve air quality. Some cities in Europe have also taken steps to tackle air pollution. Paris last month launched a ban on cars registered before 1997 during weekday daylight hours, while London is considering introducing an extra charge on polluting cars entering the center of town. Write to In-Soo Nam at In-Soo.Nam@wsj.com","output":"South Korea is making new rules to get old cars off the roads starting next year, so that they can have cleaner air in their cities. They will ban big old diesel cars from Seoul, and the cars need to have a special part that makes less pollution or else they won't be allowed in the city. If the car owners do not follow these rules, they will have to pay a fine. The government will help some people buy new cleaner cars if they cannot afford it. They want to have cleaner air like some European countries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Step 1: Understanding the premise - The premise states that Buddhism in Tibet and Nepal is influenced by elements of Tantrism, which are techniques that claim to speed up enlightenment. Step 2: Understanding the hypothesis - The hypothesis says that there are techniques called Tantrism that can speed up enlightenment. Now let's compare the premise and hypothesis: - The premise implies that Tantrism is present within some forms of Buddhism in Tibet and Nepal and that these specific techniques claim to speed up enlightenment. - The hypothesis states that there are techniques called Tantrism aimed at speeding up enlightenment. Step 3: Comparing the premise and hypothesis - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention Tantrism and techniques for speeding up enlightenment. - While the premise specifically mentions Buddhism in Tibet and Nepal as being influenced by Tantrism, the hypothesis does not mention any specific location but merely states that Tantrism exists. Given the analysis, the hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise, as the premise clearly mentions the same idea as the hypothesis (i.e., that there are techniques called Tantrism designed to speed up enlightenment). The only difference is that the premise provides additional context about where this influence is present (i.e., in Buddhism in Tibet and Nepal)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The young man (boy, really) played with his fingers in the garish light cast from the lone bulb in the concrete bunker. He scratched at an imaginary itch on his right hand (just below his thumb) to take his mind off the man in the lab coat who sat across from him at the beaten, scarred, wood table. It didn't work. And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork.

He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter.

Since 2014, RBS and NatWest have not used so-called teaser rates on savings accounts. These introductory bonuses boost the interest received in the first 12 months after an account is opened. The bank has argued that these rates make accounts difficult for customers to compare when shopping around. Les Matheson, chief executive of personal and business Banking at RBS and NatWest, told BBC Radio 4's You & Yours that such rates did not help customers. He said people found them difficult to understand and to compare. People often forgot to switch accounts once the bonus rate had expired. Last year, the bank also stopped offering 0% periods on its credit cards, during which cardholders pay no interest on their balance. Once the 0% period ends, cardholders will pay a higher interest rate - at the moment, often about 18.9% APR on their purchases. Criticising the offering of other High Street banks, Mr Matheson said they relied on customers paying the higher rate of interest. \\"We don't think that's a good way for people to manage their finances, so we've stopped doing that,\\" he said. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is currently reviewing rules on teaser rates for savings accounts, but has said it will not ban them. Mr Matheson said he agreed with FCA proposals to remind customers when a bonus period was about to end, but argued the proposals did not go far enough. RBS and Natwest offer 0.5% interest on all their savings accounts. He admitted that the rate was not very high, but insisted it was more than some customers received elsewhere. \\"Rather than people having to continually switch, let's just give them a fair everyday rate,\\" he said. Mr Matheson also defended the 100 branch closures planned by RBS and NatWest this year. He said that in some cases, only six people had been regularly going into a branch. He pointed to an arrangement with the Post Office that allows customers to access banking services and mobile banks that will move between locations. \\"If you actually look at the number of access points that a customer has, they are far, far, more today than five years ago,\\" he said. Summary:","output":"RBS and NatWest argue against teaser rates on savings accounts, stating they are difficult for customers to understand, compare, and remember to switch, ultimately not benefiting consumers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Leslie Townes \\"Bob\\" Hope, KBE, KC*SG, KSS (May 29, 1903 - July 27, 2003) was an American comedian, vaudevillian, actor, singer, dancer, athlete and author. With a career that spanned nearly 80 years, Hope appeared in more than 70 short and feature films, with 54 feature films with Hope as star, including a series of seven \\"Road\\" musical comedy movies with Bing Crosby as Hope's top-billed partner. In addition to hosting the Academy Awards show nineteen times, more than any other host, he appeared in many stage productions and television roles, and was the author of 14 books. Hope was born in Eltham, Kent (now part of the London Borough of Greenwich), the fifth of seven sons. His English father, William Henry Hope, was a stonemason from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and his Welsh mother, Avis (nee Townes), was a light opera singer from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, who later worked as a cleaner. William and Avis married in April 1891 and lived at 12 Greenwood Street in Barry before moving to Whitehall, Bristol, and then to St George, Bristol. In 1908, the family emigrated to the United States, sailing aboard the SS Philadelphia. They passed through Ellis Island, N.Y., on March 30, 1908, before moving on to Cleveland, Ohio.  From age 12, Hope earned pocket money by busking--public performing to solicit contributions (frequently on the streetcar to Luna Park), singing, dancing, and performing comedy. He entered numerous dancing and amateur talent contests as Lester Hope, and won a prize in 1915 for his impersonation of Charlie Chaplin. For a time, he attended the Boys' Industrial School in Lancaster, Ohio, and as an adult donated sizable sums of money to the institution. Hope had a brief career as a boxer in 1919, fighting under the name Packy East. He had one win and one loss, and he participated in a few staged charity bouts later in life.  Hope worked as a butcher's assistant and a lineman in his teens and early twenties. He also had a brief stint at Chandler Motor Car Company. In 1921, while assisting his brother Jim in clearing trees for a power company, he was sitting atop a tree that crashed to the ground, crushing his face; the accident required Hope to undergo reconstructive surgery, which contributed to his later bizarrely distinctive appearance.  Deciding on a show business career, Hope and his girlfriend at the time signed up for dancing lessons. Encouraged after they performed in a three-day engagement at a club, Hope formed a partnership with Lloyd Durbin, a friend from the dancing school. Silent film comedian Fatty Arbuckle saw them perform in 1925 and found them work with a touring troupe called Hurley's Jolly Follies. Within a year, Hope had formed an act called the Dancemedians with George Byrne and the Hilton Sisters, conjoined twins who performed a tap dancing routine in the vaudeville circuit. Hope and Byrne had an act as Siamese twins as well, and danced and sang while wearing blackface until friends advised Hope he was funnier as himself.  In 1929, Hope informally changed his first name to \\"Bob.\\" In one version of the story, he named himself after race car driver Bob Burman. In another, he said he chose the name because he wanted a name with a \\"friendly 'Hiya, fellas!' sound\\" to it. In a 1942 legal document, his legal name is given as Lester Townes Hope; it is unknown if this reflects a legal name change from Leslie. After five years on the vaudeville circuit, Hope was \\"surprised and humbled\\" when he failed a 1930 screen test for the French film production company Pathe at Culver City, California.  Hope's short-lived first marriage was to vaudeville partner Grace Louise Troxell, a secretary from Chicago, Illinois, who was the daughter of Edward and Mary (McGinnes) Troxell. They were married on January 25, 1933, in Erie, Pennsylvania, with Alderman Eugene Alberstadt officiating. They divorced in November 1934.  The couple had shared headliner status with Joe Howard at the Palace Theatre in April 1931, performing \\"Keep Smiling\\" and the \\"Antics of 1931.\\" The couple was working together at the RKO Albee, performing the \\"Antics of 1933\\" along with Ann Gillens and Johnny Peters in June of that year. The following month, singer Dolores Reade joined Hope's vaudeville troupe and was performing with him at Loew's Metropolitan Theater. She was described as a \\"former Zeigfeld beauty and one of society's favorite nightclub entertainers, having appeared at many private social functions at New York, Palm Beach, and Southampton.\\"  Their long marriage was fraught with ambiguities. As Richard Zoglin wrote in his 2014 biography Hope: Entertainer of the Century, \\"Bob and Dolores always claimed that they married in February 1934 in Erie, Pennsylvania. But at that time he was secretly married to his vaudeville partner Louise Troxell, after three years together on and off. I found divorce papers for Bob and Louise dated November 1934, so either Bob Hope was a bigamist or he lied about marrying Dolores in February that year. He'd actually married Louise in January 1933 in Erie when they were traveling on the vaudeville circuit. When he claimed he had married Dolores in Erie he was miles away in New York, on Broadway. More intriguing, there is no record anywhere of his marriage to Dolores, if it happened. And there are no wedding photos, either. But he never forgot Louise and quietly sent her money in her later years.\\" It is interesting to note that \\"New York City, Marriage License Indexes, 1907-1995\\" at Ancestry.com, includes a 1993 marriage license for Dolores Mary Defina and Lester Townes Hope in Manhattan.  Dolores (DeFina) Reade had been one of Hope's co-stars on Broadway in Roberta. The couple adopted four children through an Evanston, IL, adoption agency called The Cradle: Linda (in 1939), Tony (1940), Kelly (1946), and Eleanora, known as Nora (1946). From them, they had several grandchildren, including Andrew, Miranda, and Zachary Hope. Tony (as Anthony J. Hope) served as a presidential appointee in the George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations and in a variety of posts under Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan.  The couple lived at 10346 Moorpark Street in Toluca Lake, California from 1937 until his death. In 1935, they lived in Manhattan.  Hope continued an active entertainment career past his 75th birthday, concentrating on his television specials and USO tours.  Although he had given up starring in movies after Cancel My Reservation, he made several cameos in various films and co-starred with Don Ameche in the 1986 TV movie A Masterpiece of Murder. A television special created for his 80th birthday in 1983 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., featured President Ronald Reagan, actress Lucille Ball, comedian-actor-writer George Burns, and many others. In 1985, he was presented with the Life Achievement Award at the Kennedy Center Honors, and in 1998 he was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. Upon accepting the appointment, Hope quipped, \\"I'm speechless. 70 years of ad lib material and I'm speechless.\\"  At the age of 95, Hope made an appearance at the 50th anniversary of the Primetime Emmy Awards with Milton Berle and Sid Caesar. Two years later, he was present at the opening of the Bob Hope Gallery of American Entertainment at the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress has presented two major exhibitions about Hope's life -- \\"Hope for America: Performers, Politics and Pop Culture\\" and \\"Bob Hope and American Variety.\\"  Hope celebrated his 100th birthday on May 29, 2003. He is among a small group of notable centenarians in the field of entertainment. To mark this event, the intersection of Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles was named \\"Bob Hope Square\\" and his centennial was declared \\"Bob Hope Day\\" in 35 states. Even at 100, Hope maintained his self-deprecating sense of humor, quipping, \\"I'm so old, they've canceled my blood type.\\" He converted to Roman Catholicism late in life.

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City. The college's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it. The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition. Columbia University's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates is named the Alexander Hamilton Society.

Holden is the calmer, more reasonable of the duo; Banky, meanwhile, is the caustic and short-tempered half. The story opens at a comic book convention in New York City where the two are promoting their latest comic series 'Bluntman and Chronic'. During a panel discussion, they meet Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams). She is a struggling comic book writer whom is friends with the African-American comic book writer and activist Hooper (Dwight Ewell) who puts on this militant image to hide his flamboyantly gay personality.That evening, the four go out for drinks together at a local bar where Holden is attracted to Alyssa based on their conversation during a dart game. Through Hooper she invites Holden to a get together at a bar she frequents. Banks comes along and while there Alyssa is asked to sing a song. During the song Banky notices that they are in a female gay bar and that Alyssa is singing the love song to a woman in the audience and not to Holden who thinks the song is for him. The four of them end up at a booth and Alyssa and Banky have an involved conversation about sex with women and Holden is visibly upset about Alyssa being a lesbian. However, they have discovered they are both from the same area of New Jersey and the two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops. During their discussions it is clear that Holden has a very narrow heterosexual view on male female relationships and sex in general. The new friendship does not sit well with the homophobic Banky, who dislikes and distrusts Alyssa and is bothered by the relationship that develops between her and Holden. Holden and Banky's business relationship suffers as well -- the two had been on the verge of signing a lucrative deal to turn Bluntman and Chronic into television show and Banky feels that Holden is no longer taking their combined efforts or the TV show seriously.Eventually, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and...

We have this equation: -q - 4*q + 20 = 0, and we need to find out what q is. First, let's combine the two parts with q: -q - 4*q. This is like having one negative cookie and then taking away four more negative cookies. So, we get -5*q. Now our equation looks like this: -5*q + 20 = 0. To solve for q, we want to move the 20 to the other side. So, we subtract 20 from both sides: -5*q = -20. Now, we want to find out how many times -5 should be multiplied to get -20. This is like having -5 frowny faces and we want to see how many of those we need to make -20 frowny faces. We can do this by dividing both sides by -5: q = -20 / -5. A negative number divided by a negative number becomes a positive number. So, -20 / -5 becomes 20 / 5 which gives us q = 4. So the solution is q = 4.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Premier League Adopts Stricter Concussion Protocol The debate about how to best handle head injuries in soccer became even more inflamed in the aftermath of this summer’s World Cup, when fans witnessed multiple incidents in which players clearly sustained serious blows to the head yet quickly returned to the field. Now, as the top domestic leagues in Europe are set to begin their new seasons, England’s Premier League has announced changes to its in-game injury protocols. Effective immediately, the Premier League will require that any player who has a “confirmed or suspected period of loss of consciousness” on the field must be removed from the game and not be permitted to return. More important, the league is now mandating that team doctors – and not coaches or the player himself – will be unilaterally empowered to determine whether the player was knocked out and, if he was not, whether he is fit to continue after sustaining a head injury. Clubs will also be required to perform baseline cognitive testing on players before each season. Critics will note that, even with the new regulations, it is still a team employee – the doctor – making the call on whether a player can keep playing. The new rules do require, however, that Premier League clubs have a third doctor present at each game who will be stationed in the tunnel between the locker room and the field where he or she can monitor play and also utilize video replay to help identify players who may have sustained head injuries. The so-called tunnel doctor will be a significant presence in identifying when players have lost consciousness, though he or she will also be paid by the home club and not the league. “My biggest concern right when I saw the announcement was there not being a ‘neutral’ doctor making the decisions because you still have the conflict of interest when a doctor being paid by a team makes personnel decisions,” said Taylor Twellman, a former United States national team player whose career was cut short by the effects of multiple concussions. Twellman has become an outspoken advocate for reform with regard to the care of players who sustain head injuries, and he added that it will be difficult for team physicians not to feel pressure from fans or other team members if he has to evaluate a star player in an important game. “What happens if a team doctor is overcautious?” Twellman said. “You know there will still be pressure on doctors to keep best players in” the game. In a sport that is notoriously slow to change, however, the Premier League’s modifications are at least an improvement on past practices. Last season, the league was harshly criticized after an incident involving Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. Lloris clearly lost consciousness following a scary collision with an opposing player in a league game against Everton but, after receiving treatment for just a few minutes on the field, continued to play. Then, during the World Cup, there were at least three incidents in which players appeared to sustain serious head injuries but continued playing. The most notable came during the group stage, when Uruguay’s Alvaro Pereira crumpled to the ground after a collision with England’s Raheem Sterling. Pereira was obviously unconscious – several players motioned frantically for trainers to hurry onto the field and help their supine teammate – and it seemed inevitable that he would be substituted. But after being revived, and after Uruguay’s team doctor had signaled for a substitute to get ready, Pereira argued vociferously with team officials and succeeded in convincing them to let him remain in the game. (Uruguay won 2-0.) Similarly, Germany’s Christoph Kramer lost consciousness early in the World Cup final against Argentina but returned to the field anyway before ultimately being substituted about 10 minutes later. It was later revealed that Kramer was so dazed that, during play, he approached the referee to inquire as to whether the game that was going on around him was in fact the championship match. In both instances, if the rules now in place in the Premier League were enforced the players would not have been allowed to risk further injury. Yet most leagues around the world do not have clear-cut policies in these situations. Pereira had another instance recently in which he was knocked out during a Brazilian league game; again, he returned to the field minutes later. The main sticking point in most discussions about how to handle head injuries in soccer is the sport’s limit onsubstitutions. Teams are allowed only three substitutions per game, and for that reason coaches are often loathe to make one, particularly early in a match. Some have proposed that teams should be granted an additional substitution for a player who sustains a head injury, though that has raised questions about potential manipulation as well as the incongruous nature of allowing an extra sub for one type of injury but not another. Twellman said he has wondered whether it would be effective to allow teams an extra substitution in the case of a head injury but require the substituted player to then sit out for an additional period (say, a week), presumably limiting the potential for clubs to take advantage of the allowance. “I am not sure what to make of the substitution dilemma because I understand both sides,” he said. “I just know I would love to see advancement on substitutions because it would eliminate any anxiety from coaches or players who feel like making a safe substitution might be letting their team down.”","output":"The Premier League in England has made some changes to its rules regarding head injuries in soccer. Now, if a player has a confirmed or suspected period of loss of consciousness on the field, they must be removed from the game and not allowed to return. Team doctors will decide if the player was knocked out and whether they can continue playing if they've had a head injury. This is to make sure that players don't get hurt more by playing after a head injury. Some people worry that team doctors might not be neutral, but having new rules is better than not having any rules at all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Options: - one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them   - not enough information   - when one is able to acquire produce in bulk   - after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Sometimes the problem isn't us -- it's the people around us. In the nicest way possible, of course. Part of the issue could be that you just don't jive with the people around you. Maybe an older (or younger) age group, different demographic, etc., would be more up your alley. These people could bring out a side of you that is more talkative and, quite frankly, enjoys people more. Think about it. Test this theory out by joining a club. Anything that is a small class where you could get to know a group of like-minded people could show you that it's not everyone who makes you clam up -- it is just certain types of people. Some people inhibit us and others don't -- find the ones that draw you out. Maybe you're a great listener but not a great talker. Maybe you read a lot instead of partying. Newsflash! Your introverted strengths can be extroverted strengths. The next time an acquaintance is making it quite clear they're having a bad day, go up to them and ask them what's up. Your listening skills will take over. Start a conversation about the book you're reading -- if you didn't know it, extroverts read, too! Odds are if you're truly introverted, you're reflecting a lot, getting in your head, observing and noticing things. If that's the case, you're set: you have an attention to detail that is hard to cultivate organically. Use that. Notice something small and comment on it. People might be taken aback for a split second before a smile erupts on their face that someone finally noticed something about them. Everyone loves that feeling. Once you're in a social situation (which is really half the battle), get to talking. Anything. Anything at all. You obviously have opinions! And if you're uncomfortable stating how you feel, ask questions. Everyone loves it when people seem interested in them. Asking questions is an easy way out. If this is an issue, start talking when you're by yourself. Start talking more around your family and best friends. Sometimes it's hard just getting used to the sound of our own voices. Practice doesn't make perfect, but it does make habit. The more you get used to talking a lot, the better you'll be at it in all situations. The next step after talking is asserting yourself. When a chance comes up to give your opinion, take it. Unless you're advocating mass genocide or that an amorphous purple blob follows you around on Tuesdays, you probably won't incite chaos or rejection. In the scheme of things, is saying what movie you'd like to see momentous at all? Nope. How about what you thought of your boss' presentation? Nope. Just spit it out. Let other people set the tone if you'd like. One of the things most people are good at is complaining and they get really good at it when they're in groups. Find a time when you and a few friends / acquaintances are jabbing about nothing and give your opinion. If others don't like it, so be it. The conversation will move on. Introverts are guilty of often being too nice. An extrovert will grab the conversation by the horns and take a hold. Let that be you! You don't have to wait for an opening -- because it may not come. It's not rude if it's timely. Extroverts do it all the time. The only issue is to know when to do it. If you think about it, you'll probably recognize acceptable opportunities. The middle of a story about your friend's sick best friend isn't the best place. The middle of a soap box on veganism might be. If it's an active conversation or debate, go for it. If the person is venting or grieving, wait to state your business. The smaller stuff is outta the way -- now it's time to break out the big guns: attracting attention to yourself. This may involve being loud, it may not. However, more often than not, it does involve instigating action. Start a game. Talk about doing something Friday night. Get people organized. Get people doing things. Bring up a subject that everyone can talk about. Start tossing popcorn down the table. Hide awkwardly behind a small pole. Send a funny video to all your friends. Get people doing things and get people talking. . Though not all extroverts are comedians and not all comedians are extroverts, if you want to be noticed socially, a good way is to do it is to get your group laughing. The step in attracting attention is a good place to start, but you can take it even further. Even if it has to be at your own expense! Even something simple like making funny noises or moving in slow motion can get people laughing. If quirky is doable, it'll work. People will be amused and hopefully put at ease. Being social will just skyrocket from there when they join in with you! A true, true extrovert can take any awkward silence and run with it, even if it means talking about their cat. If you're in a group of people and thumbs are a-twiddling, start talking. See how many marshmallows you can balance on your forehead. Ask someone \\"truth or dare.\\" Turn on the Macarena and get dancing. Different crowds will respond to different things. If you are with a group post-Vivaldi operetta and the classic debate of steel-barrel wine vs oak-barrel wine has awkwardly drawn to a close, turning on the Macarena may not be your best bet. Know your audience -- what might get them going? What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article revolves around the topic of transitioning from introversion to extroversion, and how introverts can effectively socialize and integrate in group dynamics. The author suggests possible ways for introverts to utilize their latent capabilities to be more assertive, such as exploiting their listening skills and attention to detail. The writing emphasizes understanding the people around oneself and finding those with whom one can comfortably interact. Firstly, individuals need to analyze if the issue lies in their compatibility with their current social circle. It could be that certain demographics might be more conducive to opening up. The author proposes exploring this theory by joining a club with like-minded individuals who might draw out the more conversational side of one. Secondly, introverted strengths can also be used as extroverted strengths. For instance, capitalizing on being a good listener when someone is having a bad day or starting a conversation about a book one is reading. It requires the utilization of the power of observation and detail recognition that many introverts possess. The article also highlights the significance of practicing conversational skills in safe spaces like with family and friends to develop a habit of talking and gradually asserting oneself. It encourages taking chances to express personal opinions without fearing upsetting the status quo. One key approach suggested to break the introverted shell is to take control of the conversation when it seems fit. However, discerning when to do so is equally essential. The author also recommends attracting attention by instigating activities or starting engaging group discussions that can actively involve others. Further, the article encourages using humor or silly antics to ease the atmosphere and make the interactions more enjoyable. It states that turning any awkward silence into an opportunity for engaging the group is a hallmark of an extrovert. However, the author underlines the importance of understanding one's audience; knowing what might stimulate the group is crucial in ensuring successful social interaction. Every crowd, whether post a wine debate or a party, will require a different approach.  In essence, the article provides a comprehensive guide for introverts to leverage their inherent qualities and develop new skills to be more social and extroverted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"B: Jeff Step 1: Define the problem We need to determine whose ping will be higher: Jim, who lives 20 miles away from the server, or Jeff, who lives 2000 miles away from the server. Both have the same internet speed. Step 2: Understand ping Ping is a measure of the latency (delay) between a device and the server it's communicating with. Ping is measured in milliseconds (ms) and depends on the distance between the device and the server, as well as the speed and quality of the network connection. Step 3: Assess the impact of distance on ping Since the speed of light in glass or fiber is around 124,000 miles per second, it takes approximately 0.1 ms for a signal to travel 20 miles and about 10 ms for a signal to travel 2000 miles. However, this is an oversimplification, as many other factors such as routing, network quality, and server processing can affect ping.  Step 4: Choose the answer based on the information provided In this case, we are only given the distance from the server and the internet speed. With longer distances, it takes longer for the signal to travel between the device and the server, even if the connection speed is the same.

The American Civil War started on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces under General P.G.T. Beauregard opened fire on Union-held Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. This attack led to the fort's surrender and marked the beginning of the conflict between the Union (Northern states) and the Confederacy (Southern states) which lasted until April 9, 1865, when General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. The war was fought over numerous issues, including states' rights, economic differences, and most prominently, slavery. The Union's primary goal was to preserve the United States as a single nation, while the Confederacy sought independence and the right to maintain their way of life, which included the institution of slavery.

To do this, we will add 34*c to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -34*c term on the right side: -19*c + 34*c = -34*c - 225 + 34*c This simplifies to: 15*c = -225 Step 2: Solve for c. Now we need to find the value of c. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 15: 15*c / 15 = -225 / 15 This simplifies to: c = -15 So the solution to the equation -19*c = -34*c - 225 is c = -15."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The expression \\"14 - 0\\" simplifies to 14, so we rewrite the equation as: 2*b = 14 We are trying to isolate the variable 'b' on one side of the equation. Since b is multiplied by 2 in this equation, we will use the operation that is the opposite of multiplication, which is division, to isolate b. We divide both sides of the equation by 2. This doesn't change the equality of the equation because we are doing the same operation to both sides. This gives us: (2*b) / 2 = 14 / 2 The 2's on the left side cancel out because any number divided by itself is 1, leaving us with just 'b' on the left side of the equation: b = 14 / 2 Dividing 14 by 2 gives us 7: b = 7 So the solution to the equation 2*b = 14 - 0 is b = 7. This means that if we substitute 7 for b in the original equation, both sides of the equation will be equal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It had been previously known as the Erlachhof, a traditional hunting estate and lodge of the Dukes of Württemberg that was destroyed in 1692, during the Nine Years' War. Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, fought against France and Bavaria. Württemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704 that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of Württemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, Stuttgart, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored.Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's cornerstone by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent Philipp Joseph Jenisch to study architecture abroad. Eberhard Louis made Jenisch director of construction upon his return the next year, but he only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau's (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before 1707. The duke spent the winter of 1705–06 at Nymphenburg Palace, residence of the Elector of Bavaria, and was impressed by what he saw there and in architectural publications. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, and defiant following the loss of the Stuttgart residence, Eberhard Louis decided to follow the example of Bavaria, Baden-Durlach, and the Rhineland Palatinate. He elected to build a new palace and town inspired by Versailles, which would be the center of his domestic society and diplomacy. Located 10..., can you guess it ?

In 1938 Egypt, a team of archaeologists discover the tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah, including a young Cecil Fredericks, finding the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah. The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party. Larry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets.

As they are settling into a flat, we learn explicitly that Frankie is deaf.We hear Frankie's voice over as he writes a letter to his father, Petty Officer Davey Morrison, care of his ship the Accra. It's clear Frankie is a frequent letter-writer, with a stamp collection supplied from his correspondent -- which, it turns out is his mother. Frankie's father is clearly not on the scene, and from Nell's reaction to a personal ad seeking Lizzie, it's clear the family is anxious to avoid being found.At a new school (again) Frankie suffers some predictable petty bullying, and some counter-balancing friendship from another classmate, Catriona (Jayd Johnson). Frankie agrees to a bet with the chief pest, Ricky Munroe (Sean Brown), who asserts that Frankie's Da won't show up when the ship arrives.Desperate as the day of the ship's arrival nears, Lizzie embarks on a pick-up outing to the local pub, but quickly leaves, disgusted and distraught. When Lizzie admits her predicament -- to find a total stranger to act as Frankie's Da for one day -- to her friend (and boss) Marie, Marie provides her a name and number. Lizzie meets the man, and when he agrees to the charade she hands him all the letters from Frankie to his Da.Early the day the ship is due, Frankie bolts out of the flat and goes missing for hours. His surrogate Da is at the flat when Frankie returns. He gives Frankie a book that is somewhat skeptically received, until he tells Frankie that chose it based on what he read in Frankie's letters. Frankie's face lights up, and he runs to embrace the man.At the football tryouts, Frankie delightedly claims the spoils of his bet from Ricky Munroe. The stranger and Frankie spend the rest of the day slowly getting acquainted, by the harbor. Frankie and the man ask Lizzie for one more day, which she... The answer to this question is:","output":"Frankie has a stamp collection."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: Weekly unemployment claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 352,000 last week, the lowest level since April 2008, a sign that the country’s job situation could be improving. Stephen Bronars, chief economist with Welch Consulting, called it a “good number,” although weekly jobless claims are volatile this time of year because of post-holiday layoffs and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The Department of Labor relies on reports from state agencies, and because many field offices were closed Monday, Thursday’s report is an estimate. Until a few more weeks of data continue to signal improvement, “we should not overreact to one week of good news,” Bronars said. “After years of downsizing and job losses, there were fewer layoffs in 2011 than any year in the past decade,” he said. ”So its actually surprising that jobless claims are as high as they have been.” In 2007, right before the recession, weekly jobless claims averaged 320,000 per week. For the week ending Jan. 14, the Labor Department reported weekly applications for unemployment benefits decreased by 50,000, the biggest drop in more than six years. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 402,000 from 399,000. The four-week average, which smooths out fluctuations, dropped to 379,000, the second lowest level in more than three years, the Associated Press reported. “The key to a job market recovery is more hiring, especially in start-ups,” Bronars said. “Unfortunately, the new jobless claims report tells us little about the pace of hiring. Other surveys indicate that hiring and job creation is still behind what we have seen in previous recoveries.” Thursday’s report follows the December jobs report released earlier this month, which showed the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.5 percent, the lowest since February 2009. The U.S. economy added 200,000 jobs last month, which was better than expected. The unemployment rate, which has fallen for four straight months, has decreased in part because the labor force has barely grown in the past year. States reported that 3,026,855 people claimed Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits for the week ending Dec. 31, an increase of 100,179 from the pervious week. Congress and the president authorized a two-month extension of federal EUC benefits as of Dec. 23, which extends unemployment beyond the standard 26 weeks in most states. The Labor Department reported the highest insured unemployment rates in the week ending Dec. 31 were in: 7. Rhode Island, 4.5 percent 9.

Answer based on context: Italy had seized military control over Libya from the Ottoman Empire during the Italo-Turkish War in 1912, but the new colony swiftly revolted and transferred large areas of land to Libyan local rule. Conflict between Italy and the Senussis - a Muslim political-religious tariqa based in Libya - erupted into major violence during World War I when the Senussis in Libya collaborated with the Ottomans against Italian troops. The Libyan Senussis also escalated the conflict with attacks on British forces in Egypt. Warfare between the British and the Senussis continued until 1917. In 1917 an exhausted Italy signed the Treaty of Acroma that acknowledged the effective independence of Libya from Italian control. In 1918, Tripolitanian rebels founded the Tripolitanian Republic, though the rest of the country remained under nominal Italian rule. Local agitation against Italy continued, such that by 1920 the Italian government was forced to recognise Senussi leader Sayid Idris as Emir of Cyrenaica and grant him autonomy. In 1922 Tripolitanian leaders offered Idris the position of Emir of Tripolitania. However before Idris was able to accept the position, the new Italian government of Benito Mussolini initiated a campaign of reconquest. From 1923 to 1924, Italian military forces regained all territory north of the Ghadames-Mizda-Beni Ulid region, with four fifths of the estimated population of Tripolitania and Fezzan within the Italian area; and Italian forces had regained the northern lowlands of Cyrenaica in during these two years. However attempts by Italian forces to occupy the forest hills of Jebel Akhtar were met with popular guerrilla resistance. This resistance was led by Senussi sheikh Omar Mukhtar. How many years did it take for Italian military forces to regain all territory north of the Ghadames-Mizda-Beni Ulid region?","output":"It took Italian military forces approximately two years, from 1923 to 1924, to regain all territory north of the Ghadames-Mizda-Beni Ulid region during their campaign of reconquest in Libya. This period saw the Italian forces reclaiming control over major portions of Tripolitania and Fezzan, as well as the northern lowlands of Cyrenaica.

Q:Process:  - Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more clean energy produced happens, how will it affect LESS acid rain.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. More clean energy production: This step involves increasing the production of energy from sources that do not involve burning coal, such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear energy. Effect on the process: When more clean energy is produced, the demand and reliance on coal as an energy source would decrease. As a result, less coal would be burned, leading to a reduction in the amount of sulfur released into the atmosphere. 2. Reduction in coal burning: With less demand for coal-generated energy, the overall burning of coal would decrease. Effect on the process: Since coal burning contributes to the formation of sulfur oxides, reducing the burning of coal would lead to a decrease in the amount of sulfur oxides released into the atmosphere. 3. Less sulfur oxide release: With the decline in coal burning, there would be a subsequent decrease in sulfur oxide emissions. Effect on the process: With fewer sulfur oxides emitted into the atmosphere, there would be less potential for sulfur trioxide formation, ultimately leading to a reduction in the generation of sulfuric acid. 4. Decrease in sulfuric acid formation: The reduced emissions of sulfur oxides and lower atmospheric sulfur trioxide levels lead to a decrease in the amount of sulfuric acid formed. Effect on the process: When sulfuric acid production decreases, the acidity level of rain would also decrease, making it less acidic. 5. Less acidic rain: The reduction in sulfuric acid formation leads to a decrease in the overall acidity of the rain. Effect on the process: Lower acidity levels in rain reduce the harmful effects of acid rain on the environment, such as soil and water pollution, damage to plant life, and degradation of aquatic ecosystems. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more clean energy is produced, it would have a direct and indirect effect on the process of acid rain formation, ultimately leading to a reduction in acid rain. The key connection between the perturbation and the process is the decrease in coal burning, which results in reduced sulfur oxide emissions and subsequently less acidic rain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy. After Churchill's death, Lady Churchill...","output":"The answer to the question \\"What did Chartwell have extensive views of?\\" from the given article is that Chartwell, the country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England, and the home of Winston Churchill for over forty years, had extensive views over the Weald of Kent.

I would not have known about this film if not for its \\"surprise\\" Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature film. Thankfully, it came to pass that I was able to watch this animated little treasure. The story is about the child Brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective Abbot of the township of Kells. The main pre-occupation of the Abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, the renowned illustrator from Iona, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan befriended the white forest sprite Aisling, as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration. \\"The Secret of Kells\\" is unlike most of the animation released these days. It is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism, as much as symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of \\"Kung Fu Panda.\\" However, it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience. The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting. Try to catch this quiet gem of a film. It is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as \\"Monsters vs. Aliens\\" and the like. The sparse Celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film. OK, the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting. I would have liked to know more about the Book that Brendan and Aiden was working on.

As 2013 winds down, it’s clear mobile Internet use is at an all-time high, with 63 percent of all cell phone owners admitting they use those devices to go online. The number of consumers who say they primarily use cell phones for Internet access is up to 21 percent. While desktops will likely remain the primary method of Internet use for most users in 2014, there’s no denying mobile is a big player. For businesses, this means some serious changes as more workers than ever shift from being tied to a desktop or laptop PC to connecting to files from anywhere. This not only enables workers to connect to presentations and documents from anywhere, but it also opens up new concerns for the businesses interested in protecting data. 2014 will also bring more widespread consumer mobile adoption, bringing additional changes to corporate marketing strategies. To prepare for this increasingly-mobile world, here are a few steps businesses should take: If your business doesn’t have a BYOD policy in place, you’re already behind. Businesses are increasingly putting remote wipe and encryption software on personal devices, as well as mobile virtual workspaces that separates work data in a separate, encrypted area on a user’s personal device. If there’s even a remote possibility one of your workers could access work data on a personal device, you should have a written, signed policy in place for each of your workers. The line between work and personal will continue to blur as employees complete work during evening and weekend hours, as well as on vacation. Mobile device ownership means workers have the ability to remain connected to work at all times and that will breed an expectation that workers be reachable at all times, as well. This could mean good news, though, if employers allow their workers to be more flexible in the hours they are officially on duty. An employee who stays on the phone until ten p.m. working through an issue with a client may be forgiven for taking off early on a Friday. Unfortunately, chances are this constant connectivity will only result in Americans working longer hours and being expected to respond to calls during valuable family time. As businesses redefine the devices used to connect to servers, more employers will opt to make the move to the Cloud. Solutions like Office 365 will become the norm as these businesses realize the cost savings in having their apps supported by an outside provider for a low monthly fee. Cloud providers who provide connectivity from any approved device will be at an advantage as businesses begin to troubleshoot ways they can continue to do business in a mobile-preferred workplace. When a new solution is needed, businesses will be able to immediately find and download that solution without having to pay a team of software developers to create one. This also eliminates the need to pay tech support personnel to install and troubleshoot the software, especially if the app provider offers tech support. Even Google is recognizing that the world of search is changing. The site’s new Hummingbird algorithm addresses the role mobile now plays in search today. Users are more likely to ask a question into a mobile device than type in keywords and Google is now prepared to deliver those answers. For this reason, it’s important each business take a step back and ask themselves what questions a consumer would ask that would lead them to their website. Site content should answer questions like, “Where do I find a good plumber?” or “What’s the best Mexican restaurant near my house?” This can be done, in large part, through ensuring contact information, directions, and other frequently asked questions are addressed clearly and accurately. The suite of electronic tools a business needs to conduct daily operations is shifting. At one time, a business owner needed an Office suite, e-mail, and industry-specific software to open for business. Today’s business owner has an infinite number of apps available, many for a far lower price than traditional software. The trend toward mobile means businesses will open their minds when it comes to the software necessary to run operations. Everything from billing and scheduling to project management may be moved to Cloud-based apps, allowing small businesses with small budgets to compete against much larger companies. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. The significant rise in mobile internet usage, with 63% of cell phone owners using their devices to go online and 21% of consumers primarily using cell phones for internet access. 2. The implication for businesses as they adapt to an increasingly mobile-oriented customer base and workforce, with remote access to files and data becoming more common. 3. The importance of implementing a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy to secure work data on personal devices, including remote wipe and encryption features. 4. The potential blurring of work and personal life boundaries due to constant connectivity to work through mobile devices. 5. The increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions for businesses, such as Office 365 and various applications that can be accessed from any approved device. 6. The shift in search behavior with users more likely to ask questions on their mobile devices, prompting changes in Google's algorithm (Hummingbird) to better address these queries. 7.

Given the question: Process: - The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery - They process it with millions of tiny nephrons - Remove all the waste - The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery - Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters.  Question: suppose the person is less thirsty happens, how will it affect less waste is passed to the bladder.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"B: Less When a person is less thirsty, it indicates that their body is well-hydrated and has sufficient water levels. In this situation, the body regulates the production of urine to maintain its balance of fluids and electrolytes, which ultimately affects the amount of waste passed to the bladder. To understand this process and why less waste will be passed to the bladder when a person is less thirsty, we need to delve deeper into the workings of the kidneys and the factors that influence urine production. The primary function of kidneys is to filter blood, remove waste products, excess water, and electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and calcium, which are all present in the urine. This process is achieved through millions of tiny filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus (a tuft of small blood vessels) and a tubule (a small tube). These nephrons work together to produce urine and regulate the concentrations of various substances in the blood. When a person is well-hydrated, the hypothalamus (a region in the brain that controls thirst) signals the release of an antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, from the pituitary gland. This hormone acts on the nephrons in the kidneys, specifically on the collecting ducts, where the final concentration of urine takes place. The presence of ADH increases the permeability of the collecting ducts' walls, allowing more water to be absorbed back into the bloodstream instead of becoming part of the urine. This results in less urine being produced and consequently, less waste being passed to the bladder. As the kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery, they only send the concentrated urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters. In summary, when a person is less thirsty, their body maintains an optimal balance of fluids and electrolytes, resulting in lower urine production. Consequently, less waste is passed to the bladder under these circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Belief: Conservative MP Helen Grant said she was a 'God-fearing woman' and that gay marriage plans were consistent with her beliefs. Gay marriage is consistent with Christian values of ‘justice’ and ‘fairness’, the equalities minister has told religious critics. Helen Grant said she was a ‘God-fearing woman’ and suggested those of faith should support Government plans to legalise gay unions. Speaking ahead of a key vote on the issue next week, in which 100 Conservative MPs are expected to refuse to back the reform, Mrs Grant dismissed the idea that there was no mandate for it since it was not included in the party’s general election manifesto. She said the proposal was in a ‘contract for equalities’ published at the same time as the manifesto in 2010 and it was ‘quite clear what our intentions may well be’. ‘I am a God-fearing woman. My faith is very fundamental to everything I do and think. 'I am a member of the Church of England, a Christian, and my faith is very, very important to me,’ the Tory minister said in an interview with political magazine The House. ‘I think it’s [same-sex marriage] absolutely consistent with my beliefs. 'For me, as a Christian, I see it as about justice, equality, fairness, ending discrimination and opening up marriage to more people on the basis that marriage is a very special institution.’ Mrs Grant said the Government would make sure there was ‘proper protection’ in place for religious organisations and ministers who do not want to perform same-sex marriages. And she insisted that Tories who voted against gay marriage next week would not be damaging the party’s image.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  number of passengers  for the following movie plot:  Hercule Poirot is travelling on the Orient Express. While on the journey, Poirot meets a very close friend Bouc, who works for the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. The train is stopped when a landslide blocks the line on the second night out from Istanbul, and American millionaire Samuel Edward Ratchett is found stabbed to death the next morning. Since no footprints are visible around the train and the doors to the other cars were locked, it seems that the murderer must still be among the passengers in Ratchett's car. Poirot and Bouc work together to solve the case. They are aided by Pierre Michel, the middle-aged French conductor of the car. A key to the solution is Ratchett's revealed involvement in the Armstrong tragedy in the United States several years earlier, in which a baby was kidnapped and then murdered. (The fictitious Armstrong case was apparently inspired by the real-life kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's baby boy.)

According to Stats Canada, the population of Kensington Market increased by approximately 300 people (or 7%) from 3,740 in 2006 to 4,029 in 2011. Breaking this number down into generation status, it has been found that first generation residents increased by 75 and second generation residents increased by 20. The remaining 200 or so residents of the area are placed in the third generation or more category. Thus, the number of third generation or more residents increased significantly from 2006 to 2011. In terms of percentages, from 2006 to 2011, first generation residents dropped about 7% from 64.92% to 57.73%. Second generation residents decreased slightly from 19.04% in 2006 to 16.88% in 2011 while the percentage of third generation or more residents increased dramatically from 16.04% in 2006 to 25.39% in 2011, which represents approximately a 10% increase in residents from this generation status.

How to feed an american bully puppy  Talk with your veterinarian about what type of food is best for your bully pup.  Due to their breeding and physical appearance, bullies are a unique breed of dog and have specific food needs. At some point shortly after you adopt your bully, ask the vet what type of food they suggest you feed the dog.","output":"The vet will take into consideration factors such as your puppy's age, weight, activity level, and overall health. It is essential to provide a balanced diet rich in protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals for the proper growth and development of your American Bully puppy. The ideal food choice should support muscle growth as well as bone and joint health. When selecting a dog food brand, make sure to opt for a premium, high-quality product that is designed specifically for large breed puppies or bully breeds. Look for a food that has a high protein content, which should make up about 22-28% of the dog food. Essential fatty acids, like omega-3 and omega-6, are also vital for maintaining a shiny coat and healthy skin. Avoid foods with fillers like corn, soy, and wheat as they can cause digestive issues and offer little nutritional value. Start by feeding your puppy three to four times a day, dividing the daily amount of food recommended on the packaging. As your bully grows, you may need to adjust the meal frequency and quantity. Keep in mind that puppies have smaller stomachs but require more calories in comparison to adult dogs. Monitor your puppy's weight and body condition to identify if any changes are needed in the meal plan. Ensure that your puppy has access to clean, fresh water at all times. Dehydration can be harmful to your pet's health, and puppies are particularly prone to it. Change the water in your dog's bowl at least once a day and clean it regularly to prevent bacteria buildup. In addition to providing an appropriate diet, it is essential to establish good eating habits from the start. Avoid feeding your American Bully puppy table scraps, as this can lead to obesity and other health issues. Instead, limit treats to specific instances, such as during training or rewarding good behavior. Moreover, try to maintain a consistent feeding schedule and feeding location so that your puppy can develop a routine. Remember that providing a balanced and nutritious diet is crucial for your American Bully puppy's growth and well-being. By consulting with your vet, selecting a suitable food, and taking care of the feeding habits, you can support your bully's health and development throughout their puppyhood and into adulthood. With proper attention to diet, exercise, and training, your American Bully will grow into a strong, well-adjusted, and loyal companion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - An explosive eruption is a volcanic term to describe a violent, explosive type of eruption. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was an example. Such eruptions result when sufficient gas has dissolved under pressure within a viscous magma such that expelled lava violently froths into volcanic ash when pressure is suddenly lowered at the vent. Sometimes a lava plug will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. Explosive eruptions can send rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material up to 20 km into the atmosphere at rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred meters per second. This cloud will then collapse, creating a pyroclastic flow of hot volcanic matter.  - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\".  - An effusive eruption is a type of volcanic eruption in which lava steadily flows out of a volcano onto the ground. Effusive eruption differs from explosive eruption, wherein magma is violently fragmented when expelled from a volcano. The shape of the lava flows created by effusive eruptions is governed by the type of lava, rate and duration of eruption, and slope of the surrounding areas.  - Bristol Bay (\\"Iilgayaq\\" in Central Yup'ik) is the eastern-most arm of the Bering Sea, at 57° to 59° North 157° to 162° West in Southwest Alaska. Bristol Bay is 400 km (250 mi) long and 290 km, (180 mi) wide at its mouth. A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the Cinder, Egegik, Igushik, Kvichak, Meshik, Nushagak, Naknek, Togiak, and Ugashik.  - The Alaska Peninsula is a peninsula extending about to the southwest from the mainland of Alaska and ending in the Aleutian Islands. The peninsula separates the Pacific Ocean from Bristol Bay, an arm of the Bering Sea.   - A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They are named for their low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid lava they erupt, which travels farther than lava erupted from stratovolcanoes. This results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form. The shape of shield volcanoes is due to the low viscosity of their mafic lava.  - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland.  - Andesite (or ) is an extrusive igneous, volcanic rock, of intermediate composition, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and dacite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO) as illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts. The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks are illustrated in QAPF diagrams.  - Mount Dutton is a stratovolcano in the Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska , on the Alaska Peninsula .  - The Bering Strait (\\"Beringov proliv\\", Yupik: \\"Imakpik\\") is a strait of the Pacific, which borders with the Arctic to north. It is located between Russia and the United States. Named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born explorer in the service of the Russian Empire, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Circle being at about 65° 40' N latitude. The present Russia-US east-west boundary is at 168° 58' 37\\" W.  - Katmai National Park and Preserve is a United States National Park and Preserve in southern Alaska, notable for the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and for its Alaskan brown bears. The park and preserve covers , being roughly the size of Wales. Most of this is a designated wilderness area in the national park where all hunting is banned, including over of land. The park is named after Mount Katmai, its centerpiece stratovolcano. The park is located on the Alaska Peninsula, across from Kodiak Island, with headquarters in nearby King Salmon, about southwest of Anchorage. The area was first designated a national monument in 1918 to protect the area around the major 1912 volcanic eruption of Novarupta, which formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a , pyroclastic flow. The park includes as many as 18 individual volcanoes, seven of which have been active since 1900.  - The Bering Sea is a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean. It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity. It may also be defined as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\"  - Rhyolite is an igneous, volcanic rock, of felsic (silica-rich) composition (typically > 69% SiOsee the TAS classification). It may have any texture from glassy to aphanitic to porphyritic. The mineral assemblage is usually quartz, sanidine and plagioclase (in a ratio > 2:1see the QAPF diagram). Biotite and hornblende are common accessory minerals. It is the extrusive equivalent to granite.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.  - The Aleutian Range is a major mountain range located in southwest Alaska, and it extends from Chakachamna Lake (80 miles/130 km southwest of Anchorage) to Unimak Island, which is at the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. It includes all of the mountains of the peninsula, and what makes it so special is its large number of active volcanoes, which are also part of the larger Aleutian Arc. The mainland part of the range is about 600 miles (1000 km) long; the Aleutian Islands are (geologically) a partially submerged western extension of the range that stretches for another 1,600 km (1000 mi). However the official designation \\"Aleutian Range\\" includes only the mainland peaks and the peaks on Unimak Island. The range is almost entirely roadless wilderness, and Katmai National Park and Preserve, a large national park within the range, must be reached by boat or plane.  - Unimak Island is the largest island in the Aleutian Islands chain of the U.S. state of Alaska.  - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.  - Yukon (also commonly called the Yukon) is the westernmost and smallest of Canada's three federal territories (the other two are Northwest Territories and Nunavut). The territory is very sparsely populated with its about 35,000 people on almost half a million square kilometres. Whitehorse is the territorial capital and Yukon's only city.  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - In geology, felsic refers to igneous rocks that are relatively rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz. It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are relatively richer in magnesium and iron. It refers to those rocks rich in silicate minerals, magma, and rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium.  - Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation.  - Pumice, called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light colored. Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser.  - The Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area , as defined by the United States Census Bureau, is an area consisting of the Municipality of Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough in the south central region of Alaska.  - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains.  British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.  - The Aleutian Arc is a large volcanic arc in the U.S. state of Alaska. It consists of a number of active and dormant volcanoes that have formed as a result of subduction along the Aleutian Trench. Although taking its name from the Aleutian Islands, this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Aleutian Arc extends through the Alaska Peninsula following the Aleutian Range to the Aleutian Islands.  - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as .  - Attu is the westernmost and largest island in the Near Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and the westernmost point of land relative to Alaska, the United States, North America and the Americas. The island became uninhabited in 2010.  - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Dacite is an igneous, volcanic rock. It has an aphanitic to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. The word dacite comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described.

The North Korean government has expressed its frustration with Washington's approach to the recurring conflicts and lack of progress on diplomatic efforts surrounding denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. For years, the United States has maintained that complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is necessary for global security and stability. However, the progress towards achieving this objective has been meager, as US-North Korea relations remain hostile and mistrustful. Despite various attempts at diplomacy through multiple administrations, the two countries have not been able to reach an agreement on denuclearization. North Korean officials have condemned the US for their perceived apathy and unwillingness to find a mutually satisfying solution to the nuclear situation. They argue that the United States has not demonstrated a genuine commitment to diplomacy and has instead chosen to pursue a path of hostility, intimidation, and economic sanctions as a means of trying to force North Korea to comply with their demands. Public statements from Pyongyang are indicative of their disillusionment with the US's continuous aggressive stance rather than pursuing peaceful diplomatic solutions. Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, accused the Biden administration of \\"raising the smell of gunpowder\\" instead of working towards harmony. The North Korean officials further claim that the United States has not earnestly tried to engage in meaningful dialogue. The American response to these allegations has emphasized their commitment to a diplomatic solution and working closely with allies in the region. The US has maintained its position that they are committed to a comprehensive and verifiable path towards denuclearization, in close collaboration with South Korea and Japan. Despite North Korea's criticism of the US's approach, skepticism remains on their motivation as well. Critics argue that North Korea's key motivation is to alleviate the crippling economic sanctions they face. US officials maintain that a tangible and measurable commitment to denuclearization should be demonstrated by North Korea before sanctions can be lifted. This recent escalation in tensions between the United States and North Korea underscores the ongoing challenges in resolving the nuclear issue. As both sides continue with their hostile narrative, it remains to be seen whether diplomacy can prevail in finding a solution to the impasse. The complexities involved require a delicate balance of addressing security concerns and fostering trust and cooperation. The impact of this conflict is far-reaching, with regional and global ramifications. Alleviating tensions and moving closer to a resolution would have significant benefits for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the wider international community. For now, it is crucial that both parties remain committed to dialogue and exhaust all diplomatic options in their pursuit of a comprehensive and lasting solution to the nuclear issue."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The Rebellion of Arbanon in 1257-1259 was a revolt of the Principality of Arbanon  against the Empire of Nicaea and in favour of the rival Despotate of Epirus. Arbanon had long been an autonomous principality within Epirus, and the Nicaean conquest around 1255 was resented. The rebellion was a reaction to the imposition of Nicaean rule in the person of governor Constantine Chabaron. The rebels were active in Durrë, Ohrid, Debar and Mat. The Nicaean forces were under the command of George Akropolites, who described the events himself in his history. In the autumn of 1257, Akropolites left Thessaloniki and by way of Kastoria entered Kounavia, Mat and Debar in an effort to convince the local chieftains to abandon the Despot of Epirus, Michael II, and submit to imperial rule. Yet, in February 1258 the Nicaean garrisons were annihilated. Taking advantage of the situation, Michael II started his campaign against the Nicaeans and captured Chabaron in Kanina. The Albanians drove back the imperial troops sent as reinforcements and Akropolites set fresh troops in the move, opening his way to Ohrid and Prespa, but without having a chance to engage the rebels in the inner regions. He was forced to return to Prilep and fell captive to Michael II. The revolt was suppressed after troops from Asia Minor were sent in the spring of 1259, headed by John Komnenos. The most decisive battle was fought in the city of Devol. After suffering heavy losses, the Byzantines were finally able to control the situation, but in the years 1260-1270 the Albanian rulers revolted again in the region of Durrës.

They did not have a manager to tell them what to do during their games. They were playing in a big soccer competition called League One.

The loser would be in big trouble of falling out of the league, which is a very sad thing for soccer teams. The game took place in a big field called the Proact Stadium. Both teams played very hard to try and win the game. The players were running super fast and kicking the ball as hard as they could. The game was very exciting and close. It was hard to tell who would win. Finally, towards the end of the game, something amazing happened! A player named Dan Gardner scored a goal for Chesterfield! This goal would help them win the game. Everyone on Chesterfield was so happy and proud of their teammate Dan. They had won this important game without a manager, and now they had a better chance of staying in League One.

I read this background article the other day: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.  I am facing a new situation today: Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would Archimedes' device more likely or less likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one? The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the background information provided, machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. In the given situation, Archimedes, being a great inventor of machines, came up with a great machine as expected by the king of Sicily. On the other hand, Ptolemy, given the limited time, could not create a machine, but instead produced a device that was not a machine. In order to evaluate which device would more likely make work easier, we should consider the principles mentioned in the background article. Since Archimedes' device is a machine, it would inherently adhere to one or more of the principles that make work easier—increasing force, increasing distance, or changing the direction of force. These principles enable machines to complete tasks more efficiently and with less effort than if the tasks were performed manually. Ptolemy's device, however, is not a machine, which implies it does not follow the principles of machines that make work easier. Consequently, it might not be as effective at increasing force, distance or changing the force direction, leading to inefficient or more difficult work relative to Archimedes' machine. Given this understanding of the situation, it can be concluded that Archimedes' device would more likely make work easier than Ptolemy's device because it is a machine following the principles that make work easier, while Ptolemy's device is not a machine and does not adhere to those principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Roberto Lee: \\"I don't think I'd be as complete a manager as I am today without the EMBA.\\" Roberto tells CNN how his EMBA has helped his career. CNN: Tell us about your current role. Roberto Lee Jr: I'm president of Fresh Bread & Company, in Shanghai, which I started in 2004. We supply finished products like sandwiches, cakes and desserts for Starbucks, Walmart, Metro AG, Tesco, and a number of franchised restaurants. We also have a more upscale chain with bakeries, coffee shops and the biggest bread chain in the Shanghai subway system. We currently have 620 employees, 32 shops in Shanghai, and we hope to expand into Eastern China next year. CNN: You already had an MBA, what made you decide to do an EMBA? RL: We are hoping to expand Fresh internationally, at least in Asia, and it could become an international company. The Tsinghua/INSEAD EMBA is a really global MBA. We had classes in Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, Abu Dhabi, and Fontainebleau (in France) so it gave a very international focus. In each city INSEAD arranged for guest speakers from very large companies to tell us about the business environment in each country. It gave me much more of an international focus. CNN: How has that global focus helped you with your business? RL: In my class I had senior people from 17 countries. We became like a family and we are still in touch. I've been in different countries the last few years and my classmates have entertained me and showed me around in each of the countries. Down the road, if we decide to go into some of these countries, I have contacts and I've learned from my classmates, from their past experiences and the experiences they're going through. CNN: What was the biggest difference between the MBA and the EMBA? RL: A key difference is seniority. The average age on the MBA was 28 and on the EMBA it was 37. On an MBA people are getting ready to move into senior management, whereas much more senior management things being discussed on the EMBA. The other difference is that for the MBA you take off two years of your life. With the EMBA you still work, so every five to six weeks you meet for a week or two and you go to classes. With the EMBA you don't get spend as much time on the books, so an MBA is more theoretical and with the EMBA you learn a lot more from your classmates. I had numerous high-level people in my class and they shared how they've done things in the past. Read more business related features. CNN: So because you're working at the same time, can you put what you've learned into practice? RL: That's what was really cool -- all my classmates did it, taking stuff from class and applying it. I was able to get help from my finance professor about international standards for how some things are done on the books. The professors all have working experience -- they're not just people with PhDs who teach -- so you can ask for advice and even now I can email them and ask their advice. CNN: Can you think of any example where you've directly applied something you learned from the EMBA to your business? RL: We learned about how one company got all its senior managers together and went out for a weekend brainstorm to set out their strategy for the next year. That's something we did this past year at Fresh, and we set out a really clear path and goals. So far we've met all our goals this year, so it was a really great way of doing it. CNN: Would you have got where you are today without the EMBA? RL: It helped me out a lot -- I don't think I'd be as complete a manager as I am today without the EMBA. It's given me a broader perspective for being a manager for all departments. My strong point has always been sales and when the company started that was the area I pushed the hardest, but now I'm diving more into finance, accounting, marketing and HR. After the EMBA I have a much clearer idea what's going on in my company within all the different departments -- that's where it's really been a huge help for me. CNN: What would you say to people put off by the expense of an MBA? RL: If you're going to do an EMBA program, do a good one. Tuition plus time and expense will usually run into six figures in U.S. dollars, but if you get into a good program it's very worth it.

Article: Children in the United States are exposed to many influences other than that of their families.Television is the most significant of these influences,because the habit of watching television usually begins before children start attending school. Parents are concerned about the lack of quality in television programs for children.The degree of violence in many of these shows also worries them.Studies indicate that,when children are exposed to violence,they many become aggressive or insecure. Parents are also concerned at,out the commercials that their children see on television. Many parents would like to see fewer commercials during programs for children.And some parents feel that these shows should not have any commercials at all because young minds are not mature enough to deal with the claims made by advertisers. Educational television has no commercials and has programs for children that many parents approve of The most famous of these is Sesame Street,which tries to give preschool children a head start in learning the alphabet and numbers.It also flies to teach children useful things about the world in which they live. Even though most parents and educators give Sesame Street and shows like it high marks for quality,some critics argue that all television,whether educational or not,is harmful to children.These critics feel that the habit of watching hours of television every day turns children into bored and passive consumers of their world rather than encouraging them to become active explorers of it. Question: In what ways do children suffer from television? Answer: The answer is:","output":"Children suffer from television in several ways: 1. Exposure to violence: Many television programs, including those for children, contain a degree of violence.

Influence of commercials: Parents are concerned about the commercials their children see on television. Young minds are not mature enough to deal with the claims made by advertisers, and many parents would like to see fewer commercials during children's programs. 3. Lack of quality content: Parents are concerned about the overall lack of quality in television programs for children. Many shows may not provide adequate educational or intellectual stimulation for young minds. 4. Impact on active exploration: Critics argue that even educational television can be harmful to children, as the habit of watching hours of television every day turns children into passive consumers of their world, rather than encouraging them to become active explorers of it. In summary, children may suffer from television due to exposure to violence, the influence of commercials, a lack of quality content, and the potential hindrance to their active exploration and understanding of the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You would be forgiven for thinking this was a typical urban concert in the U.S. -- but it's thousands of miles away in the tiny African nation of Gabon. I've journeyed to this equatorial country for \\"Inside Africa\\" to find out why the Gabonese are such faithful followers of the American hip hop scene and its culture, I also want to know what makes contemporary music here different from other African nations. My first stop is 104.5 Urban FM, one of the most popular radio stations in the country. He's helping the government in its effort to reach out to","output":"youth and promote local talent while also fostering cultural exchange between the United States and Gabon. As I speak to the station's music director and several hip hop artists, it becomes clear that the deep connection between Gabonese youth and American hip hop stems from a shared experience of struggle and aspirations for a better future, transcending geographic boundaries. It's not just about the music; it's also about the values and messages embedded in the lyrics, which often resonate with the challenges faced by young Gabonese in their day-to-day lives. While American hip hop has undoubtedly influenced the local scene, Gabon's unique blend of cultural elements and traditional sounds sets its contemporary music apart from that of other African nations. From the vibrant rhythms of the Gabonese dance style \\"Ekang\\" to the pulsating beats of the \\"gros tambour\\" drum, Gabon's rich musical heritage is infused into the modern hip hop sound, creating a distinctive fusion that sets it apart on the African music scene. As I continue my journey through Libreville and beyond, I am struck by the power of music in uniting people across cultures and continents. The dedication of Gabonese artists and the unabated support of their fans have provided a platform for creative expression that has the potential to inspire and shape future generations. In this ongoing exchange of ideas and artistry, the Gabonese hip hop community is not only strengthening its ties with the United States but also asserting its unique identity on the global stage."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: Who got expelled?

With their state-of-the-art campus and highly esteemed educators, Evergreen High School is considered one of the best schools in the region.  Tiffany, a straight-A student, is the perfect exemplar of discipline and grace. Known for her pristine reputation, she is the school council president and also a part of the drama club. Justin, on the other hand, is known for his charm and popularity. He is the captain of the football team, adored by his classmates and often finds himself on the receiving end of lenience from the school authorities. One day, the entire school is shaken by a scandalous rumor that Tiffany and Justin have been secretly involved in an underground drug syndicate that operates within the school premises. Initially dismissed as baseless gossip, the rumor continues to grow, with the students and faculty members becoming increasingly convinced of Tiffany and Justin's dubious activities. Despite their efforts to prove their innocence, the school authorities decide to make an example of them by expelling both students– an unprecedented event in the history of Evergreen High. Their expulsion leaves Tiffany and Justin ostracized from their peers, and their families struggle to cope with the loss of their reputation. Determined to uncover the truth behind these false accusations, Tiffany and Justin join forces to conduct their clandestine investigation. The deeper they delve into the school's dark underbelly, the more they realize the sheer web of lies and deception that exists within the institution they once loved and trusted. Throughout their journey to uncover the truth, Tiffany and Justin are faced with countless struggles and mental battles, ultimately making them grow closer and realize they have more in common than initially thought. They stumble upon a secret, and powerful cabal, composed of some of their fellow students and faculty members, including the principal, who profit from the illegal drug trade within the campus. As their will and determination are tested, Tiffany and Justin form unbreakable bonds with one another, and together, they embark on a path to expose the people responsible for their downfall. Defying the odds, they fight for justice, eventually pulling the strings to bring the sinister machinations to light. In the dramatic climax, armed with compelling evidence and the support of a rogue journalist, Tiffany and Justin confront the manipulative principal and expose the organised, criminal conspiracy that has plagued Evergreen High School for years.

Justin had heard that stir fry food was a great way to eat more vegetables, which Kevin struggled with.","output":"Justin had heard that stir fry food was a great way to eat more vegetables, which Kevin struggled with, so he decided to introduce his friend to the delicious and nutritious world of stir-fried dishes and help him improve his dietary habits. To begin their culinary adventure, Justin researched various stir-fry recipes that were packed with flavorful sauces and an assortment of vegetables. He wanted to ensure that the meals they would prepare were not only healthy but also mouthwatering, in order to encourage Kevin to genuinely enjoy consuming more vegetables. Justin even consulted with a dietitian to better understand the nutritional benefits of different vegetables, like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants they offered, as well as the healthiest ways to cook them without losing too many nutrients. Upon gathering an array of recipes and tips, Justin invited Kevin over to his place for a cooking session, during which they would prepare a few of these stir fry meals together. Kevin was quite hesitant at first, unsure of whether he would like the dishes or not, but Justin's enthusiasm and passion won him over, and they began their exploration of various ingredients and cooking techniques. As they chopped, sauteed, and experimented, Justin explained the health benefits of each vegetable they included, emphasizing its importance to one's overall well-being. He also shared tips on retaining the texture and flavors, such as avoiding overcooking or using high heat when stir-frying. Along the way, Kevin discovered a wealth of flavors and textures he hadn’t experienced before, and his interest in incorporating vegetables into his meals began to grow. To make the experience even more enjoyable and social, they invited friends and family to join them for a stir-fry dinner party. They served a colorful spread of dishes, such as vegetable stir-fry with tofu, spicy chicken and broccoli stir-fry, and shrimp with mixed peppers and mushrooms. Kevin was pleasantly surprised by the rave reviews their cooking received and found himself engaging in conversations about the health benefits of the meals they'd prepared. In the weeks that followed, Justin and Kevin continued to explore new recipes, their friendship growing stronger as they bonded over their shared love of healthy, delicious cuisine. They experimented with various sauces, such as teriyaki, garlic and chili, and sweet and sour, learning how to create the perfect balance of flavors to enhance the natural taste of the vegetables. Gradually, Kevin became more comfortable with the thought of incorporating a wide variety of vegetables into his meals, and his once limited palate expanded to appreciate the range of textures and tastes offered by stir-fried dishes. Over time, not only did Kevin successfully increase his daily vegetable intake, but he also inspired his friends and family to follow suit. His journey alongside Justin had unlocked a newfound appreciation for the power of good nutrition and the capacity for stir-fry meals to transform one's relationship with vegetables entirely."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet. The next day I couldn’t apply any pressure and couldn’t walk at all. I was dirty and smelly and needed some serious help on my leg but I was too far from any civilization.

Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun. Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \\"No skating\\" signs to make sure you can skate there. How is the passage organized? A) It tells stories about skating.

In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa.

Step 3: Round each integer in the list one by one. Now let's solve the given instance: 1. Round -811: The nearest multiples of 10 are -810 and -820. Since -811 is closer to -810 (difference is 1), we round -811 to -810. 2. Round -58: The nearest multiples of 10 are -60 and -50. Since -58 is closer to -60 (difference is 2), we round -58 to -60. 3. Round 411: The nearest multiples of 10 are 410 and 420. Since 411 is closer to 410 (difference is 1), we round 411 to 410. 4. Round -296: The nearest multiples of 10 are -290 and -300. Since -296 is closer to -300 (difference is 4), we round -296 to -300. 5. Round -396: The nearest multiples of 10 are -390 and -400. Since -396 is closer to -400 (difference is 4), we round -396 to -400. 6. Round -295: The nearest multiples of 10 are -290 and -300. Since -295 is exactly halfway between -290 and -300, we round up to -290. 7. Round 911: The nearest multiples of 10 are 910 and 920. Since 911 is closer to 910 (difference is 1), we round 911 to 910. 8. Round -619: The nearest multiples of 10 are -610 and -620. Since -619 is closer to -620 (difference is 1), we round -619 to -620. 9. Round -370: The nearest multiples of 10 are -360 and -380. Since -370 is exactly halfway between -360 and -380, we round up to -360. 10. Round -50: Since -50 is already a multiple of 10, no rounding is needed. It remains -50.

Translate to Russian: Corvara, Abruzzo","output":"Your phrase \\"Corvara, Abruzzo\\" remains the same in Russian because it's a proper noun describing a location. In Russian, it's \\"Корвара, Абруццо\\".  Just to give a little more information, places and names are usually not translated but rather are transliterated to match the pronunciation system of another language. In other words, it is written or spelled as it sounds in the language of origin. \\"Corvara, Abruzzo\\" refers to a municipality in the Province of Pescara in the Italian region of Abruzzo. Now, when we say it in Russian, we don’t change the spelling but adjust the pronunciation to suit the Cyrillic script, hence it's \\"Корвара, Абруццо\\". Moreover, remember how each country's language uses different alphabets. Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, which can often create differences in pronunciation or spelling from the Roman/Latin alphabet that English, Italian, and a majority of other languages use. So, when you are translating names or places from a Latin script language to Cyrillic script language, you don't actually translate but transliterate to preserve the name's original identity. For pronunciation, you would say:  - Корвара is pronounced as \\"Korvara\\" (emphasis on the first syllable), - Абруццо is pronounced as \\"Abrutso\\" (emphasis on the second syllable). Overall, it's important to note that translations for names, especially ones in different scrips, can differ slightly based upon regional accents and dialects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: \\"I'd be better off dead.\\" he said, without any hesitation . Hearing those words come out of my best friend's mouth tore my heart apart. He has repeated that phrase more than once, and my mind continually plays it over like a voice recording. I met him about three years ago. After knowing me for six months, he told me about his struggles with depression . Sadness was not the only feeling that came over me; I was shocked. He seemed so outgoing and happy all the time. I soon learned that he was hurt physically and mentally as a young child, causing him to have the thought of killing himself. He refuses to talk to others about his depression because he now distrusts adults, especially those in his family. However, he feels as if I understand him and that I know the right words to speak. Therefore, when it comes to helping him, convenience is not in my vocabulary. It does not matter where I am or what I am doing, for he always comes first. Many students at his school laugh at him when they notice scars on his arms from cutting. As he sees it, other kids have every right to make fun of him. But no one holds such a right, so I encourage him to ignore the heartless kids who treat him badly. When he feels the weight of judging eyes or hateful voices, I always remind him that I care about him unconditionally. Just hearing me say I will always be his best friend seems to give him the safety he needs to keep on going. My best friend once told me that if he had not had me, he would not be alive. He said that my encouraging words helped him not to take his life. Our friendship has taught me that a single kind word can influence someones life. Life is not easy for every one, which makes me strongly believe in the necessity of encouragement. Question: What is the best title for the passage?

If yes, write \\"True\\", otherwise write \\"False\\". Question: How are the directions of the velocity and force vectors related in a circular motion Suggestion: It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation (and constant speed), or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. Answer:","output":"False. The suggested answer does not directly address the relationship between the force and velocity vectors in circular motion. Instead, it simply describes that circular motion can be uniform or non-uniform. To answer the question, the relationship between the directions of the force and velocity vectors in circular motion must be discussed. In a circular motion, velocity is always tangent to the circular path, pointing in the direction of motion. On the other hand, the centripetal force, which is responsible for keeping an object in circular motion, always points towards the center of the circular path. For uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is constant, and its direction is always perpendicular to the velocity vector. This means that the force and velocity vectors are at a right angle, providing a change in the direction of the motion without changing the speed. In non-uniform circular motion, an additional tangential force can be applied parallel to the velocity vector, either in the same direction (accelerating) or opposite direction (decelerating). In such scenarios, the resultant force acting on the object would not be exactly perpendicular to the velocity vector. However, the centripetal force component would still be perpendicular to the velocity vector and is responsible for changing the direction of motion. Therefore, the relationship between force and velocity vectors in circular motion lies in the fact that the centripetal force is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, while the tangential force is parallel to the velocity vector. In uniform circular motion, the force vector is solely due to centripetal force, which is always perpendicular to the velocity vector. In non-uniform circular motion, the total force vector is the combined effect of centripetal and tangential forces."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"the crystals arent able to form\\" happens, how will it affect MORE minerals forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"In order to determine if the perturbation hypothesis has an effect on the process, let's first analyze the steps of the process and then consider the impact of the perturbation where \\"the crystals aren't able to form.\\" Process steps: 1. Magma cools inside the crust. 2. Magma crystallizes to form intrusive igneous rocks. 3. Lava cools on the surface. 4. Lava crystallizes to form extrusive igneous rocks. 5. Minerals dissolved in water crystallize. Perturbation hypothesis: \\"the crystals aren't able to form.\\" Now, let's examine how this perturbation would affect each step of the process: 1. Magma cools inside the crust: This step remains unaffected as it doesn't involve crystal formation. 2. Magma crystallizes: Here, the perturbation comes into play. Since the crystals aren't able to form, the magma will not solidify to form intrusive igneous rocks. Instead, it might remain as a semi-solid, amorphous material. 3. Lava cools on the surface: This step remains unaffected as it doesn't involve crystal formation. 4. Lava crystallizes: Similar to step 2, the perturbation affects this step. The lava will not solidify to form extrusive igneous rocks. Instead, it will also stay as a semi-solid, amorphous material. 5. Minerals dissolved in water crystallize: The perturbation would also impact this step. Minerals dissolved in water will not crystallize, leading to an accumulation of dissolved minerals and altering the composition of the water body. In conclusion, the perturbation where \\"the crystals aren't able to form\\" does have a direct effect on the mineral formation process at steps 2, 4, and 5. This can result in the absence of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks, as well as an accumulation of dissolved minerals in water bodies. Indirectly, these changes could affect the geological and geochemical processes that involve mineral formation and crystal growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: (CNN) Dylan Thomas, the Georgia high school football player who died after a game last month, succumbed to cardiac arrest stemming from a head injury, the Pike County coroner said in a Tuesday statement.      The 16-year-old's death has been ruled an accident, the statement said. Specifically, his cardiac arrest was the result of \\"traumatic brain injury due to or as a consequence of a closed head injury.\\"      No autopsy was conducted because Thomas' injuries were documented at the hospital, according to the statement.      The athlete's parents are fine with the decision not to conduct an autopsy, coroner Terrell Moody said, adding that the mother and father did not wish to make any statement.      Game stopped after injury      Pike County high school player Dylan Thomas died Sunday after a hit on the field in a game.      Dylan needed assistance standing but was alert and responsive to questions when he told trainers that he had lost feeling in his left leg, the coroner's statement said.      He was helped off the field and examined by an orthopedic surgeon and the Pike County certified trainer, the Georgia High School Association said.      Dylan's condition began deteriorating roughly seven minutes after he came off the field, according to the coroner.      Known as \\"DT\\" to those who loved him, Dylan lost consciousness and was taken to a hospital in the rural Zebulon, about an hour's drive south of Atlanta, before being taken to another hospital in Atlanta. The coaches agreed to call off the rest of the game, Pike County High School Principal Kevin Huffstetler said.      Dylan Thomas' jersey hangs in a wreath of roses before the Pike County High School game against Rutland High School.      He died at the Atlanta hospital on September 30, after at least 40 hours of surgery, medical testing and additional life-saving measures, the coroner said in a statement.      He was in \\"great physical shape,\\" and there were no pre-existing medical conditions detected, the statement said.      Without an autopsy, there is no way to know whether Dylan had an unidentified pre-existing condition.      Doctors \\"described to Dylan's parents the nature of the injury as an anomaly, requiring the perfect amount of pressure on the perfect spot at the perfect angle,\\" according to the statement.      No evidence of negligence      The Georgia High School Association, the organization that oversees Georgia high school sports, said there \\"is no indication of any negligent action by anyone associated with Pike County in this incident.\\"      \\"The coaches had taken every precaution to prepare for potential injuries and went beyond the required standards when working within the concussion protocol,\\" the organization said.      In reviewing the game film and speaking with school officials, the association said there was no indication that Dylan received an injury in the second quarter.      Pike County Coach Brad Webber said officials are not sure when or how Dylan was injured. Coaches reviewed video of the game to try to pinpoint what happened -- whether he had taken a hit to the head, for example -- but nothing stuck out, he said.      Video of Dylan's final game was released by Pike County High School. The footage does not show any traumatic or catastrophic hits to his head. At one point in the second quarter, he is seen in the video being hit by two players on a running play and is slow to get up. He continues playing.      \\"The questioning coming from everyone is when did it happen,\\" Pike County School Superintendent Michael Duncan said. \\"We understand. We just don't know.\\"      Teen laid to rest      Dylan's teammates and members of the junior varsity team wore their red jerseys, as his family requested. The number 32 was scrawled in red on car windows in the church parking lot, some accompanied by the words \\"Dylan Strong.\\"      Football players from Peach County, the team the Pirates were playing when Dylan fell unconscious, also attended the service in their gray jerseys.      On Friday, the Pirates suited up to play Rutland High School. No. 32 balloons were released under the Friday night lights of the field in Macon.      Teammates said they were determined to play for Dylan and for everyone in their community. Dylan's parents wanted the team to play, too.      \\"The loss of Dylan will now force us to strengthen our hearts,\\" teammate Jordan Holley said. \\"We may not be the fastest, strongest or best team in our region and we may not win another game this season, but moving forward there's not a single high school team in the United States that has more heart than us right now.\\"      The Pirates defeated Rutland 48-2. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      A Georgia high school football player who died after suffering injuries during a game last month died of cardiac arrest as a result of a traumatic brain injury and the death was classified as an accident, the coroner said Tuesday.      Dylan Thomas, a 16-year-old linebacker at Pike County High School in Zebulon, died after being injured in a Sept. 28 game and he was pronounced dead on Sept. 30, Pike County Coroner Terrell A. Moody said in a statement. The boy’s age had previously been reported as 17.      \\"Dylan's official cause of death is: Cardiac Arrest, due to, or as a consequence of Traumatic Brain Injury, due to, or as a consequence of a Closed Head Injury,\\" Moody said, and he classified the manner of death as accidental.      Play was stopped for an injured player in the third quarter of a game against Peach County, Moody said. Dylan was standing, with assistance, and was able to verbally communicate with staff, but his condition soon deteriorated and he was transported by ambulance and flown by helicopter to a hospital in Atlanta.      Dylan's uncle, Nick Burgess, told the Associated Press earlier in October that after the teen was hit he later collapsed on the sidelines when his arm and leg went numb. Moody said Dylan underwent multiple surgeries and other life saving measures over 40 to 45 hours at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta before being declared dead.      The determination of the cause of death was based on documented injuries and treatments he received, and after a crime lab determined an autopsy was not necessary, Moody said in the statement.      Coach Brad Webber called Dylan, of Hollonville, \\"one of the finest young men I have ever had in my life\\" and \\"just an outstanding young man.\\"      His family said in an obituary that \\"Dylan lived life to the fullest. He was a true friend, who never met a stranger. He was a loving son and brother.\\"      Moody said in Tuesday’s statement that Dylan was a healthy 16-year-old and no preexisting medical conditions had been found in any physicals, or during treatment at Grady Memorial Hospital.      He said that \\"Medical staff at Grady described to Dylan's parents the nature of the injury as an anomaly, requiring the perfect amount of pressure on the perfect spot at the perfect angle.\\"      The Georgia High School Association said in a statement last week that a review of the incident determined Dylan was wearing a brand-new 2018 Riddell helmet and that that helmet type is the highest-rated helmet that the company manufactures. The GHSA said there was no indication of any negligence and that \\"the coaches had taken every precaution to prepare for potential injuries and went beyond the required standards when working within the concussion protocol.\\"      \\"Pike County continues to extend its condolences to the family of Dylan Thomas during this time and in view of this unfortunate tragedy,\\" Moody said. \\"The outpouring of love and support from the community and many others has been amazing.\\"      Recent injuries in high school, collegiate, and professional football have opened a debate over whether stricter safety regulations are needed. And some parents question whether teenagers and young children should be allowed to play football at all.      A poll earlier in the year conducted by NBC News found that 48 percent of Americans say they’d encourage a child who wanted to play football to play a different sport due to concerns about concussions.      On Oct. 5, the first game played by Pike County High School since Dylan's death, players paid tribute to the fallen player before going on to win the game against Rutland High, NBC affiliate WXIA of Atlanta reported. Players from both teams shook hands and carried Dylan's jersey onto the field to take a knee, and other jerseys displaying his number, 32, were hung around the field, the station reported. |||||Summary:","output":"Dylan Thomas, a 16-year-old Georgia high school football player, died of cardiac arrest resulting from a traumatic brain injury sustained during a game. The death has been ruled an accident, and no autopsy was conducted. Thomas's injuries were documented at the hospital, and his parents were fine with the decision not to conduct an autopsy. The Georgia High School Association found no indication of negligence on the part of Pike County, and the coaches had taken every precaution to prepare for potential injuries. This incident raises questions about safety regulations in high school football and whether stricter rules are necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Prestige Movie plot: The Prestige begins with shots of several dozen top hats inexplicably strewn about in a forest.Cutter (Michael Caine), in voiceover, explains the three parts of a magic trick while performing a disappearing bird trick for a little girl. Part one is the pledge, where the magician shows you something ordinary, like a bird. Part two is the turn, where he does something extraordinary, like make the bird disappear. But this isn't enough. There always has to be a third act, the prestige, where you have a twist, and bring the bird back. Only then will the audience applaud.Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), stage name \\"the Great Danton,\\" attempts a transporting trick that involves walking under a giant electrical machine with a Tesla coil and then disappearing through a trapdoor. Except that he falls straight into a giant tank of water that has been placed under the stage, and is automatically locked inside. A man in the audience, who we shortly learn is fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), stage name \\"the Professor,\\" forces his way beneath the stage in time to see Angier drown.After this introduction, we follow three timelines at once. In the present day (19th century England), Borden is on trial for murdering Angier, who we learn was his greatest rival. Cutter is revealed to be Angier's engineer, the man who builds the machinery for his tricks, and the little girl is Borden's daughter Jess (Samantha Mahurin).Cutter confides to the judge in a private meeting that the machine Angier was using wasn't built by him, but by \\"a wizard,\\" and it legitimately did what it appeared to do.The trial does not go well for Borden, and he faces execution. Later, in jail, Borden is approached by the solicitor for a collector, Lord Caldlow, who is interested in buying his secrets, particularly the secret of Borden's famous \\"Transported Man\\" trick.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on... How long ago did Trump probably pay Cohen 130,000?

Question: Information:  - Android 2 is a shoot 'em up maze video game written by Costa Panayi and published by Vortex Software in 1983 for the ZX Spectrum and in 1985 for the Amstrad CPC.  - The Amstrad CPC (short for \\"Colour Personal Computer\\") is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990. It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and the German-speaking parts of Europe.  - Highway Encounter is a computer game released on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Commodore 64, and Tatung Einstein by Vortex Software in 1985. It was written by Costa Panayi who also coded \\"Android\\", \\"Android 2\\", \\"TLL\\", \\"Cyclone\\" and \\"Revolution\\".  - MSX is the name of a standardized home computer architecture, first announced by Microsoft on June 16, 1983, and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then Vice-president at Microsoft Japan and Director at ASCII Corporation. Microsoft conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various hardware makers of the period.  - Revolution is an isometric 3D puzzle video game released by U.S. Gold in 1986 for the Sinclair Spectrum and Amstrad CPC . It was programmed by Costa Panayi and is a development of the earlier 3D games Highway Encounter and Alien Highway .  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory.  - Vortex Software was a video game developer founded by Costa Panayi and Paul Canter in the early 1980s to sell the game \\"Cosmos\\" which Panayi had developed for the Sinclair ZX81. They converted the game to the ZX Spectrum, but due to the low sales of the ZX81 version they licensed the game to Abbex.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.  - U.S. Gold was a British video game publisher and developer from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s, producing numerous titles on a variety of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit platforms.  - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory.  - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - Costa Panayi is a computer game programmer during the 1980s. He founded Vortex Software with Paul Canter, publishing games for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Yes  for the following movie plot:  On July 29, 1939, renowned British big game hunter Captain Alan Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon) slips through the forest undetected near the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's residence near Berchtesgaden. Getting the dictator in his telescopic sight, he pulls the trigger on his unloaded rifle and gives a wave. He ponders a moment, then loads a live round, but is discovered at the last second by a guard, and the shot goes wild.After being beaten up, Thorndike is taken to Major Quive-Smith (George Sanders). Quive-Smith is also a devoted hunter and an admirer of Thorndike. Thorndike explains that it was a \\"sporting stalk\\", not to kill, but just for the thrill of going after the biggest game of all. The Nazi half-believes him, but insists he sign a confession that he was in fact working for His Majesty's government. When Thorndike refuses, he is tortured, but remains steadfast and warns of \\"questions being asked in high places\\" if he is killed, as his brother, Lord Risborough (Frederick Worlock), is a very important diplomat. The phrase gives Quive-Smith the idea to have Thorndike thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident.Thorndike survives when his knapsack gets caught in a tree, breaking his fall. He eludes his German pursuers and reaches a port. He steals a rowboat, but is forced to abandon it hastily when a patrol boat comes near. He swims to a Danish ship about to sail for London. Vaner (Roddy McDowall), the English cabin boy, helps Thorndike hide. The Germans find Thorndike's coat and passport aboard the rowboat and search the nearby ship. Though they find nothing, they place agent Mr. Jones (John Carradine) on board using Thorndike's passport to continue looking even after the ship leaves the harbor.Jones is met by German agents in London. Thorndike, mistakenly believing he is now safe, casually debarks and is spotted. He manages to shake off his pursuers by ducking into the apartment of Jerry Stokes (Joan Bennett), a young woman. Jerry lends him money so he can reach his brother.When Lord Risborough...

Write an article based on this summary: In the latest Newsround Special Frontline Families, we look at the impact war can have on military families. Article:","output":"Title: Frontline Families: The True Impact of War on Military Families Introduction In the latest Newsround Special, we delve into the untold stories of Frontline Families – the military families who bear the brunt of the emotional, logistical, and financial challenges that come with being intimately connected to the harsh realities of war. The weight of these burdens often goes unnoticed or ignored, and for many military families, the impact reverberates long after the last shots have been fired. Emotional challenges faced by military families It is no secret that war can take a heavy emotional toll on soldiers. However, less attention is given to the impact on the families of these heroes. The emotional stress experienced by military families can range from constant worry and anxiety for the safety of their loved ones to grappling with the uncertainty of when they might return home. Moreover, when soldiers return from deployment, they might undergo a period of emotional disturbance or exhibit signs of PTSD. This can profoundly affect their relationships with their families, who must adapt to changes in behavior and demeanor while also seeking to help their loved ones heal. The strain on marriages and family dynamics Consider the strain of having one parent away for long periods, with the ever-present possibility of danger. The spouse who stays behind must assume the role of both parents, fulfilling responsibilities and managing household duties that would have otherwise been shared. Moreover, children may grow up with a void in their lives, missing out on the bonds and memories usually formed with both parents present. The divorce rate in military families is alarmingly high compared to civilian marriages, and the root cause lies in the pressure of constant separations and the emotional turmoil experienced by both the deployed and those waiting at home. It takes considerable resilience and determination for a military family to adapt to these circumstances and maintain a healthy support system among themselves. Financial constraints and other practical challenges Aside from the emotional strain, military families often face practical challenges. One such challenge is managing their finances. Deployed soldiers are entitled to additional benefits and allowances, but for many, this is not enough to cover the extra costs associated with moving or maintaining two households in the case of multiple deployments. Additionally, military families often have limited access to adequate healthcare and education facilities, as the location or frequent relocations can hinder their ability to receive consistent, high-quality services. Conclusion As the Newsround Special Frontline Families discusses, the impact war has on military families is significant and far-reaching. Coping with emotional distress, strained family dynamics, financial challenges, and limited access to essential services underscores the tremendous sacrifice military families make in supporting their loved ones called to serve. Greater awareness of these issues is crucial for society to acknowledge and appreciate the sacrifices made by these families. As we commend the bravery of soldiers on the frontlines, let us not forget the struggles and courage of their families at home, striving to hold together the very fabric of what these soldiers fight for – family, love, and unity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign.

Chesty Morgan, a woman whose bust is 73 inches in size, plays Jane Tennay, a large breasted secret agent. Her agency wants her to assassinate, one by one, an organized crew of low grade heroin pushers. In order for her to prove her killings, they plant a tiny camera in her big left breast. Each time she needs a photo taken, she takes off her shirt and clicks over her left breast. Unlike the previous film, there's no smothering and only one death sequence involves her monstrous breasts.

The construction contract was placed with William Broadhead , Bethel Furness and William Anderson in 1795 . Furness having died later in 1795 , the aqueduct was completed by the remaining partners in 1799 , but not brought into use until 1800 . Seven men lost their lives during its construction .

The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome. The original members of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. The Communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009. No member state has left the EU or its antecedent organisations (Greenland, an autonomous territory within Denmark, left the Communities in 1985). The United Kingdom signified its intention to leave after a membership referendum in June 2016 and is negotiating its withdrawal. The United Kingdom and its independent territories are scheduled to leave the European Union by 31 January 2020.

One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's named Dr. Bizet arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance (Maxine Doyle) is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows.","output":"How does Dr. Bizet's revelation about Professor Kristan's mother being bitten by a vampire bat and the concept of Lamarckism connect to the mysterious murders happening in the village and Kristan's trance-like state of murderousness?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a \\"A).\\" movie review (OPTIONS: A). negative; B). positive;).","output":"A). Negative Movie Review: Title: \\"Invasion of the Clichés: The Movie That Fell Short\\" In an era where creativity and innovation reign supreme, \\"Invasion of the Clichés\\" stands as a painful reminder that some films still choose to throw originality to the wind, opting to rely on tropes and stereotypes that were outdated years ago. This film was riddled with inconsistencies, gaping plot holes, average performances, and a borrowed aesthetic that left me feeling cheated of my time, as well as my hard-earned money. Beginning with the screenplay, or rather, the skeletal framework that it is, \\"Invasion of the Clichés\\" aims to combine elements of sci-fi, action, and romance in a futile attempt to entice diverse audiences. Unfortunately, the storyline is ridiculously predictable, allowing the viewer to accurately gauge upcoming events, character twists, and ultimately, the drab and unsatisfying ending. The film is laden with clichéd dialogues that make the audience cringe instead of evoking emotion. Relying on stock phrases, cardboard character traits, and a plot structure reminiscent of countless films before it, \\"Invasion of the Clichés\\" lives up to its name far too effectively. The characters populating the film suffer from a severe lack of depth, making it difficult to engage with them on any meaningful level. Our \\"hero\\" – if he can even be called that – is an uninspired action film archetype, seeming more like a collection of worn stereotypes that tepidly limps onto the screen rather than a fully-fleshed out human being. Side characters are no better; thrown in purely to drive the plot forward, but bereft of any detail that would make them the slightest bit memorable or worthwhile. Performances from the film's primary cast are unremarkable, with each actor struggling to bring a sense of realism to their stale, one-dimensional roles. There are no standout moments or riveting monologues, simply a cast that, at best, is occasionally watchable. A portion of the blame must also be placed on the director, who appears to have been comfortable with the thought of plagiarizing scenes and techniques from previous blockbusters, rather than showcase any original vision. The result is an imitation of a film that could have been passable, if not for the glaring inadequacies in every other aspect. Visually, \\"Invasion of the Clichés\\" borrows heavily from its genre counterparts, but leaves the audience feeling that something is constantly amiss. CGI sequences, processed to the point of becoming cartoonish, often detract from what little suspension of disbelief the cliché-sodden storyline provides. The editing of the film, coupled with erratic pacing, only reinforces the sense that an inexperienced hand guided this production from start to finish. In conclusion, \\"Invasion of the Clichés\\" is a film that simply does not deliver, on any level, what moviegoers deserve and expect. It's a movie that leans too heavily on passé trends, tropes, and visual gimmicks in an unsuccessful attempt to overshadow its glaring inadequacies.
