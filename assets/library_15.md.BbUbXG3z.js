It supersedes Integer BASIC and is the BASIC in ROM in all Apple II series computers after the original Apple II model. It is also referred to as FP BASIC (from \\"floating point\\") because of the Disk Operating System (DOS) command used to invoke it, instead of INT for Integer BASIC. Applesoft BASIC was supplied by Microsoft and its name is derived from the names of both Apple and Microsoft. Apple employees, including Randy Wigginton, adapted Microsoft's interpreter for the Apple II and added several features. The first version of Applesoft was released in 1977 only on cassette tape and lacked proper support for high-resolution graphics. Applesoft II, which was made available on cassette and disk and in the ROM of the Apple II Plus and subsequent models, was released in 1978. It is this latter version, which has some syntax differences from the first as well as support for the Apple II high-resolution graphics modes, that most people mean by the term \\"Applesoft.\\"  - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\".

Mark was attending the music festival in his city. First, he went to stage one, where the music was playing in high decibel. Then he went to stage two. There the music was playing in low decibel. He kind of liked the latter one.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which stage would be louder, stage one or stage two?  Hint: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, stage one would be louder than stage two. This is because stage one has music playing at a high decibel level, which means it has greater intensity and loudness compared to stage two, where the music is playing at a lower decibel level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Because of this he has an amazing view of the sunset. One day Michael decides to head out to the cliff and notices the sky looks much more red than normal. He also remembers that on the previous day he couldn't see his shadow at all.  Given Michael goes out one day and notices he can't see his shadow, which is the most likely weather, clear skies or overcast?  Hint: When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.

Step 1: Establish the nutrient value of each option. - (i) A used popcorn bucket: A used popcorn bucket would have barely any popcorn left, offering very little nutritional value. - (ii) An empty can of corn: An empty can of corn implies that all the corn has been removed, so there would be no nutrients available from the corn itself. There could be a bit of residual juice/liquid remaining in the can, but its nutritional value would be minimal. - (iii) A dead strawberry bush: Although dead, a strawberry bush could still have lingering nutrients in its branches, leaves, and roots. This would provide energy for decomposers such as fungi and bacteria. However, the overall nutritional value for living things would be limited. - (iv) A pickled jicama root: Jicama is a root vegetable with nutrients like fiber, vitamin C, and potassium.

It grows in a variety of wetlands, including pond and lake margins across an extremely large range from eastern Canada south to Argentina. A few examples include northern rivers, the Everglades and Louisiana. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? it can be found in argentina","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"it can be found in Argentina\\" does follow given the preceding text. The text explicitly mentions that Pontederia cordata, also known as pickerelweed, is native to the American continent and has an extensive range extending from Eastern Canada to Argentina. This means that it can indeed be found in Argentina, as it is within the plant's geographical distribution. Pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata) is an important plant in the ecosystems it inhabits, providing numerous benefits to both wildlife and water quality. Its attractive purple-blue flowers make it an aesthetically pleasing addition to ponds and lakes, while its broad leaves create an ideal habitat for many aquatic animals such as frogs and small fish. As an aquatic plant, pickerelweed plays an essential role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. Excess amounts of these nutrients can lead to eutrophication and algal blooms, which can be detrimental to aquatic life. By removing excess nutrients, pickerelweed helps to ensure that the aquatic habitats remain healthy and balanced. In addition to providing habitat and improving water quality, pickerelweed is a valuable food source for various wildlife species, such as ducks and other waterfowl. The seeds of the plant are a favored food source for these birds, and the plant’s leaves and stems are also sometimes eaten by herbivorous mammals like muskrats. Pickerelweed is not only important as a native plant of the American continent but is also often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking flowers and foliage. Gardeners and landscapers often use it in water gardens, rain gardens, and naturalistic pond edges, adding both beauty and functionality to these settings. In Argentina, Pontederia cordata can be found in various wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and the shores of ponds and lakes. Since this plant is highly adaptable, it can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a suitable candidate for various aquatic restoration projects throughout the country. In conclusion, Pontederia cordata, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a versatile and beneficial aquatic plant native to the American continent, including Argentina. It contributes to the health and diversity of pond and lake ecosystems as a habitat provider, nutrient absorber, and food source, while also being an attractive feature for ornamental purposes in various types of water gardens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the place with the iron overshot wheel? is inside the article: The newest bridge across the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington., can you guess it ?

The Black Pearl is a fictional ship in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. (The physical ship used as a prop during filmmaking is actually named the Sunset.) In the screenplay, the Black Pearl is easily recognized by her distinctive black hull and sails. Captained by Jack Sparrow she is said to be \`\`nigh uncatchable''. Indeed, in the first three films she either overtakes or flees all other ships, including the Interceptor (regarded as the fastest ship in the Caribbean) and the Flying Dutchman (which is actually faster against the wind).

Next question: who replaced judas as a disciple of jesus?","output":"After Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and subsequently committed suicide out of remorse, the remaining eleven apostles felt the need to fill the void left by Judas in their ranks. They believed that bringing the number of apostles back to twelve was essential as it symbolized the twelve tribes of Israel. The replacement of Judas as a disciple of Jesus is recorded in the New Testament, specifically in the Book of Acts, chapter 1, verses 15-26.  In this account, the apostle Peter took the initiative to address a gathering of about 120 disciples and propose that they choose someone who had been with them since the beginning of Jesus' ministry, witnessing his baptism, miracles, teachings, and ultimately his crucifixion and resurrection. The aim was to find someone who could be a credible witness to Jesus' life and his message of salvation. Two potential candidates were identified: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. After the apostles prayed for guidance, they cast lots to decide which of the two would replace Judas as the twelfth apostle. The lot fell on Matthias, and he was subsequently chosen to become the new disciple. The casting of lots was a customary way to make decisions and seek divine judgement in Jewish tradition, as it was believed that the outcome would reflect God's will. Not much is known about the life and deeds of Matthias from the canonical scriptures. However, some early Christian traditions offer additional information about him. For example, the apocryphal texts of Clementine Recognitions and the Apostolic Constitutions mention that Matthias was among the seventy disciples sent out by Jesus to spread his teachings during his ministry. The Acts of Andrew and Matthias, another apocryphal work, recounts a missionary journey of the two apostles to a city of cannibals. According to various traditions, Matthias preached the gospel in different regions, including Judea, Ethiopia, and Cappadocia (present-day Turkey), where he eventually suffered martyrdom. It is important to note that the selection of Matthias as the replacement disciple is not universally accepted. An alternative perspective considers Paul the Apostle – originally known as Saul of Tarsus – as the rightful successor to Judas. Paul, who was initially a persecutor of early Christians, underwent a dramatic conversion after experiencing a vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus. He later became one of the most influential figures in the spread of Christianity and the development of its theology. Although not chosen directly by the other apostles to replace Judas, Paul's self-proclaimed apostleship and his crucial role in the growth of the early Christian Church have led some to view him as the God-appointed replacement for Judas Iscariot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995.

Such nuggets fuel an industry of prophetic warnings of decline, exemplified by the phrase \\"How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented\\" in the subtitle of Thomas Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum's recent best-seller.

Step 4: Develop the ending As the years passed, the United States began to see the benefits of a more globally balanced world, despite having to concede its unrivaled dominance. International cooperation increased, and the world began to tackle pressing issues such as climate change, poverty, and education with greater unity. Global partnerships were bolstered by increased cultural understanding and mutual respect among nations. The US continued to remain a key player on the world stage, collaborating and competing with the emerging Asian powers and the consolidated European Union. Recognizing its own strengths in innovation, higher education, and cultural influence, the United States leveraged these assets to forge a new, mutually beneficial relationship with the rising nations of the East. In this world of shared prosperity, the idea of a singular superpower became a thing of the past. The United States, along with China, India, and other influential nations, worked side by side to address global challenges and shape the course of history. Fear of decline gradually gave way to a steadfast commitment to collaboration and progress for all. And so, the story ends not with a tragic fall, but rather with a hopeful vision.

Article: The formal study of adolescent psychology began with the publication of G. Stanley Hall's \\"Adolescence in 1904.\\" Hall, who was the first president of the American Psychological Association, viewed adolescence primarily as a time of internal turmoil and upheaval (sturm und drang). This understanding of youth was based on two then new ways of understanding human behavior: Darwin's evolutionary theory and Freud's psychodynamic theory. He believed that adolescence was a representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s when psychologists such as Erik Erikson and Anna Freud started to formulate their theories about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological disturbances associated with youth were biologically based and culturally universal while Erikson focused on the dichotomy between identity formation and role fulfillment. Even with their different theories, these three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently a time of disturbance and psychological confusion. The less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such as peer relations and cultural influence, were left largely ignored until the 1980s.

The supposed perturbation would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. To clarify, high heat exposure to water during recycling could affect a few steps in the process: 1. Washing and cleaning: High heat exposure to water might alter the efficiency of cleaning and washing processes, which are crucial for removing contaminants from recyclable materials. This can impact the quality of the final recycled product. 2. Thermal recycling processes: Some materials undergo thermal recycling processes like melting or heating for further processing. An unexpected fluctuation in heat exposure could potentially impact the efficiency of these processes, leading to inconsistencies in the final product's quality. 3. Cooling and solidification: After the materials have been processed, they need to cool and solidify before being used in manufacturing. High heat exposure to water might interfere with the cooling process, leading to irregular shapes and inconsistencies in the solidified material properties.

During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.

The incident has caused outrage across the country, renewing discussions on racial tensions and inequality that still persist in South Africa. Background and Context The disturbing video, which went viral on social media, captures the distressing ordeal faced by a black man who is forced into a coffin by the white perpetrators. The aggressors can be heard laughing and making racist remarks during the incident, as the victim pleads for his release. Following a swift investigation by law enforcement authorities, the two white men were apprehended and now face charges of assault and kidnapping. Officials have condemned the racially motivated violence, emphasizing that such incidents only serve to exacerbate racial divisions in South African society. Moreover, the authorities assured the public that all perpetrators of racially-charged crimes would be brought to justice. Persistent Racial Inequality in South Africa Although South Africa has made significant progress since the end of apartheid in dismantling segregation and addressing racial disparities, the coffin incident is a sobering reminder that the country still struggles with racism and inequality. Racial tensions often flare up in areas where communities are segregated by historical design. Unemployment and poverty rates among non-white South Africans remain significantly higher compared to their white counterparts. Racial incidents like the coffin video also serve as a wake-up call for the need to address broader systemic issues, such as the ongoing land reform debate in South Africa. The government has been grappling with the challenge of redressing the unequal land distribution that was a product of apartheid policies, with land ownership highly skewed towards a white minority. The Need for Reconciliation and Dialogue It is evident that South Africa has made substantial strides in recent years to foster a more inclusive and just society. However, the coffin incident underscores that there is still much work to be done to eradicate the lingering racial disparities. Continuous dialogue and reconciliation efforts are crucial in bridging the divide and promoting understanding between different racial and ethnic groups in the country. One such way citizens can actively participate in the fight against racism is by reporting any incidents of racial violence or discrimination to authorities, to ensure that justice is pursued. Furthermore, educational initiatives aimed at teaching South Africans about the nation's history and overcoming its dark past must be promoted. Conclusion The recent coffin video incident is a stark reminder of the persistence of racial tensions and inequality in South Africa. The arrest of the white perpetrators is an essential step towards achieving justice and serves as a warning against racially motivated crimes. The incident emphasizes the importance of ongoing reconciliation efforts, dialogue, and systemic changes to create a truly diverse and equal society for all South Africans."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Recently the news broke that Microsoft are acquiring GitHub. Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft’s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce...

The focus of the text is primarily on the reactions and opinions surrounding Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub, as well as the transformation that Microsoft has undergone during Satya Nadella's tenure as CEO. However, the main point of the passage is to address the lingering cynicism and skepticism from some individuals regarding Microsoft's involvement in open source. It highlights how the company has evolved from its earlier stance against open source, having become a significant investor, participant, and supporter of numerous open-source projects. The author also acknowledges the fact that not everyone will fully trust Microsoft, regardless of its progress in the open-source community. With the discussion of someone's grumbling about Microsoft, it is implied that skepticism exists due to the company's past actions and the emotional attachment many have to open source's mission and values. In conclusion, there is no mention of an individual named John or his emotional state, hence the answer is D. not enough information."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: How does the General prevent the troll from leaving?

The key to keeping the beast within the confines of the book's pages is hidden among the fantastical stories. Our protagonist embarks on a thrilling adventure to explore the enchanted storybook and must confront the characters within to protect the kingdom. Act 1 - The General Awakens The General, a stoic and sturdy warrior named Argus, is awoken to a grave message; the prophecy of a vicious troll that would ravage the kingdom has finally come to pass. Argus hesitantly accepts this weight on his shoulders and is guided by the kingdom's sorceress to where the enchanted storybook lies: a forgotten library hidden in the heart of the castle. Act 2 - The World Within Argus opens the enchanted storybook and is transported into its fantastical world, where he must confront the magical characters within. These characters represent parodies of familiar folktales. Argus learns that the troll's prison is weakening, and if he doesn't complete a series of challenges to fortify the enchanted storybook, the troll will escape, and the kingdom will be destroyed. Act 3 - Between the Lines As Argus furthers his mission, he discovers that knocking down specific pages of the book will interfere with the troll's plans, ultimately preventing it from escaping. He battles his way through the myriad of characters and challenges, even as they try to stop him. Some of the storybook characters have been negatively influenced by the troll's dark aura, manipulating them into loyalty to the monstrous creature. Act 4 - The Key to the Kingdom In the climax of the story, the troll has almost fully escaped from the enchanted storybook. In the nick of time, Argus uncovers a vital piece of information. It is revealed that the troll's storybook is a metaphorical cage itself, broken apart by Argus' experiences through each page. To trap the troll, Argus must complete the book's challenges and face his deepest fears. Act 5 - The Final Chapter Argus gathers allies that he met throughout the storybook world, and with their help, confronts the troll one last time. They battle the creature to prevent it from leaving the book, and as each storybook page closes once again, they restore the troll's prison. The troll's destructive power is contained, and Argus returns to his beloved kingdom, triumphant. In the end, Argus revitalizes the forgotten library, preserving the enchanted storybook for future generations, ensuring the troll's permanent confinement. Through the power of storytelling, the kingdom learns the importance of unity, courage, and the limitless potential of the imagination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now under the assumed name \\"Sweeney Todd\\", Barker returns to London with sailor Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower). At his old Fleet Street lodgings above Mrs. Nellie Lovett's (Helena Bonham Carter) pie shop, he discovers that Lucy, having been raped by Turpin, has poisoned herself, and his teenage daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) is now Turpin's ward, and like her mother before her, is the object of his unwanted affections. Nellie has kept Todd's silver barber knives hidden in the Barkers' old room, which is supposedly haunted. Todd vows revenge, reopening his barber shop in the upstairs flat.While roaming London, Anthony spots Johanna and falls in love with her, but is ejected from the Judge's house by Turpin and his associate, Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall). Far from being discouraged, the sailor becomes determined that the pair will elope.

Options are: (a). negative (b). positive","output":"The sentiment of the following sentence could be considered as positive. The sentence can be parsed into two main ideas: 1. Children of varying ages are in the audience the speaker is addressing. 2. These children are well-behaved throughout the event, as they don't cough, fidget, or need constant bathroom breaks. The focus of the sentence relies on the observed behavior of the children, which is described as non-disruptive. The speaker specifically notes that they are not causing distractions or seeking attention during the event. This lack of improper behavior implies that their demeanor is positive or, at the very least, non-negative. Furthermore, the sentence is written as if to report something worth mentioning. The use of \\"in all fairness\\" denotes a sense of being balanced and justified in their observation—implying that the situation's outcome was somewhat unexpected or went against a potential preconceived notion about the children's behavior. The speaker could have assumed that, due to their varying ages, the children could have disrupted the event, but the result was quite the opposite. By considering the context and implications of the sentence, we can conclude that the sentiment leans towards being positive. The children's good behavior made the situation enjoyable and harmonious, which can be perceived as a positive outcome.

Context: I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. Question: What did the narrator attempt to request of the doctor? Answer: OPT: i. not enough information. ii. an innocent request. iii. to let them choose which arm to get the shot in. iv. to give them the shot in the left arm.

Natural uranium consists of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-236 and -240, which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244. It is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay, which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): When uranium isotope is formed from the decay of neptunium-237?","output":"Uranium-233 is the isotope that is formed from the decay of neptunium-237.

With its distinct console-inspired interface and numerous customization options, this app has truly enriched my smartphone experience, earning it a solid 4-star rating. Upon launching the app, I was pleasantly surprised by the innovative command-line interface that immediately transported me back to my days tinkering with MS-DOS on my old PC. As smartphones become increasingly cluttered with apps and features, ohi.andre.consolelauncher's minimalistic design offers a refreshing change of pace. By typing commands to open apps, make calls, or send messages, I have rediscovered the simple joys of using my phone for essential tasks. The customization options added an extra layer of personalization, with the ability to change colors, fonts, and highlighting to suit my preferences. I was equally impressed by the RAM saving feature, and my phone seemed to run smoother than ever. The built-in command list proved very helpful in learning my way around the app. Additionally, the ability to create shortcuts for frequently used commands provided a touch of convenience that made navigating the launcher even more enjoyable. However, there were a few areas that I felt could be improved, slightly impacting the overall user experience. For beginners, the learning curve may initially appear steep compared to traditional launchers. An interactive tutorial or similar in-app guidance would undoubtedly help users acclimate more quickly to the environment. During my time with the app, I also encountered occasional glitches with command execution. While not overly disruptive, these bugs could present potential frustrations for some users. Finally, I would appreciate a wider range of readily available commands and support for third-party app integration. This would make the launcher feel more comprehensive and versatile, becoming an even more powerful and valuable tool for users with diverse needs. In conclusion, ohi.andre.consolelauncher is a fantastic app that brings a unique and engaging console-inspired interface to Android devices. The customization options, RAM saving feature, and overall design make this launcher a pleasure to use. With a few minor improvements, such as enhanced in-app guidance, ironing out execution glitches, and expanding command offerings, this app could easily reach a 5-star rating. I highly recommend giving ohi.andre.consolelauncher a try - you might just find yourself reinvigorated by a fresh, innovative smartphone experience!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bucs' Galloway Will Miss Four to Six Weeks TAMPA, Fla. - Tampa Bay's sputtering offense suffered a major blow Monday when the team learned receiver Joey Galloway will miss four to six weeks after aggravating a groin injury... What is this text about?","output":"This text is about an unfortunate development within the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' football team, specifically regarding their offense. The team has discovered that their wide receiver, Joey Galloway, will be absent from the field for four to six weeks due to a recurring and aggravated groin injury. Joey Galloway, an essential player in Tampa Bay's offense, has suffered a setback that will have a significant impact on the team during the time he is sidelined. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, already struggling with their offense, will now face the challenge of finding ways to compensate for this loss and adapt their game strategies. Groin injuries are relatively common in sports that involve running, sudden directional changes, and quick leg movements, like in football. They can be extremely painful and can require substantial recovery time. Thus, Joey Galloway will need to focus on proper healing and therapy in order to return to the field in full form and prevent further complications to the injury. The team, in turn, will need to establish plans to cover for Galloway's absence. This may involve relying on backup receivers, modifying their plays, and potentially reshuffling the team roles in order to compensate for the gap left by Galloway. The coaching staff may have to reassess their offensive strategies for the upcoming games and consider adjustments to minimize the impact of this loss on the team's performance. In summary, the text is about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' wide receiver Joey Galloway being sidelined for four to six weeks due to an aggravated groin injury, and the potential consequences this development may have on the struggling offense of the team. The Buccaneers will have to face the challenges of adapting their game plan and finding alternative ways to strengthen their offense during Galloway's recovery period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Going into a trance is often associated with what sort of unconscious involuntary movement at night? Options:  A. hungry  B. peacefulness  C. religious experience  D. loss of balance  E. sleepwalking A:","output":"E. Sleepwalking Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a behavior that occurs during sleep and is characterized by unconscious and involuntary movements at night. Sleepwalking typically occurs during stages 3 and 4 of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which is the deep, restorative stage of sleep. This is the option most in line with common sense when discussing going into a trance and unconscious involuntary movement at night. While some people might associate trances with a sense of religious experience (C) or peacefulness (B), these options are less commonly associated with unconscious involuntary movements that occur at night. Furthermore, hunger (A) would not be a logical option to consider, as it does not involve any involuntary movements while a person is asleep. Lastly, loss of balance (D) might occur during sleepwalking but is not, in and of itself, a best fitting description of the question. In conclusion, sleepwalking (E) is the most fitting option in line with common sense to describe a trance-like state associated with unconscious involuntary movement at night. Sleepwalking is a well-known phenomenon, and it typically occurs during the deep stages of sleep, turning the individual into an unconscious and involuntary participant of walking or moving within their environment."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Process:  - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose air is cleared of carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect there is no carbon dioxide in the area.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of clearing all carbon dioxide from the area will have an indirect effect on the process. Let's analyze this step-by-step: 1. Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - This step will not be directly affected by the lack of carbon dioxide in the area, as the body will still be able to inhale oxygen through the nose or mouth. 2. The air travels into the windpipe - This step will not be directly affected, as the air inhaled will still travel through the windpipe. 3. The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - This step will not be directly affected, as the air (with or without carbon dioxide) will be divided to both lungs. 4. The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - This step will not be directly affected by the lack of carbon dioxide in the area, as the lungs will still be able to oxygenate the blood. 5. Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - Here, an indirect effect may happen. Since there is no carbon dioxide in the inhaled air, the cells will not have to filter it out. However, they will still produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct of cellular respiration. 6. The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - This step will not be directly affected, as the produced carbon dioxide will still be carried back to the lungs by the bloodstream. 7. The carbon dioxide is exhaled - This step will not be directly affected, as the body will still exhale the carbon dioxide that was produced by the cells. In conclusion, the perturbation of clearing all carbon dioxide from the area will have an indirect effect on the process of respiration since the cells would not have any carbon dioxide to filter. However, this may not make a significant impact on the overall functionality of the respiratory system, as the cells would still produce and exhale carbon dioxide as a natural byproduct of cellular respiration."},{"instruction":"I read this background article the other day: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream...  I am facing a new situation today: Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires.

The relentless airstrikes have resulted not only in immense destruction but also in the heart-wrenching loss of innocent lives. In the midst of such despair, medical professionals, like Dr. Muhammad Waseem Moaz, have risked their lives to provide much-needed assistance and hope. Regrettably, Dr. Moaz, one of the last remaining pediatricians in rebel-held Aleppo, was killed in an air strike on Thursday. Dr. Moaz's Life and Legacy Dr. Muhammad Waseem Moaz, a Syrian national, committed his life to the service of his fellow citizens, primarily focusing on the plight of the vulnerable children caught in the crossfire.  Step 1: Elaborating on Dr. Moaz's background. Dr. Moaz was trained as a pediatrician and had been practicing in Aleppo for several years before the start of the Syrian conflict. His dedication to the medical profession led him to persevere, even as the situation in Aleppo deteriorated. Step 2: Describing Dr. Moaz's immense contribution during the Aleppo crisis. Throughout the conflict, Dr. Moaz continued to provide essential healthcare services to thousands of children in need. He worked tirelessly, often under dangerous conditions, and served as a beacon of hope for besieged families in Aleppo. Step 3: Sharing testimonies from colleagues and patients. Colleagues and patients of Dr. Moaz were left heartbroken by his tragic demise. They fondly remember his compassion, courage, and unwavering commitment to serving the children of Syria. Some of these testimonials highlight the lasting impact of his work and the enormous void left behind. The Impact of Dr. Moaz's Loss Step 4: Acknowledging the repercussions of losing a dedicated pediatrician in a conflict-ridden area. The loss of Dr. Moaz is a devastating blow to the already fragile healthcare system in rebel-held Aleppo. With a limited number of pediatricians remaining, children will face even greater hardships in accessing adequate healthcare. Dr. Moaz's death has further increased the burden on healthcare workers and put countless lives at risk. Step 5: Contextualizing the loss within a broader pattern of attacks on healthcare facilities and professionals. Dr. Moaz's tragic death is a regrettable addition to the growing list of targeted attacks on healthcare facilities and professionals in Syria. These attacks not only deprive people of desperately needed care but also add an extra layer of threat to an already hazardous profession. International organizations have called for the protection of healthcare workers and facilities, and for an end to these atrocities. Conclusion: Moving Forward and Honoring Dr. Moaz's Legacy  Step 6: Reflecting on the need for a lasting and meaningful solution to the ongoing Syrian conflict. The tragic passing of Dr. Muhammad Waseem Moaz serves as a stark reminder of the immense challenges faced by Syrian civilians and healthcare professionals. It is pertinent upon the global community to rally together in search of a just and lasting solution to the ongoing Syrian conflict. Step 7: Encouraging readers to honor Dr. Moaz's memory through support and advocacy. In commemoration of Dr. Moaz's life and enduring commitment to the welfare of children, we must endeavor to amplify the voices calling for peace, security, and an end to the violence that has claimed countless innocent lives.

The same difficulty I have with the musical version of \\"Les Miserables\\" applies equally to \\"Oliver.\\" Instead of the composers' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings, they merely wrote Broadway-type melodies, which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed. Too, the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score. It's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste. The casting of the boy Oliver doesn't help matters: tentative of timbre and vexingly precious, there's something less than solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, though the tunes he's obliged to sing have little basis in period manner. \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" is given a strident rendition, throaty and strained. The two big production numbers, \\"Who Will Buy\\" and \\"Consider Yourself\\" seem over-produced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. It's one thing to go all out, yet another to cross over the line into excess.  The gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess I have trouble with Mr. Dickens' consciousness, in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the given equation -5445*x + 583*x = 606*x + 278868 for x, we'll perform the following steps: Step 1: Combine the terms containing x on the left-hand side of the equation. (-5445 + 583) * x = -4862 * x The new equation will be: -4862 * x = 606 * x + 278868 Step 2: Move the term containing x from the right-hand side to the left-hand side. By subtracting 606 * x from both sides, we'll have: -4862 * x - 606 * x = 278868 (-4862 - 606) * x = -5468 * x So the equation is now: -5468 * x = 278868 Step 3: Divide both sides by -5468 to solve for x. x = 278868 / -5468 x ≈ -50.974 So the solution for the given equation is x ≈ -50.974."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism.  - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU.  - The Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia was the area of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia that was placed under a military government of occupation by the Wehrmacht following the invasion, occupation and dismantling of Yugoslavia in April 1941. The territory included Serbia proper, with the addition of the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat. This territory was the only area of partitioned Yugoslavia in which the German occupants established a military government. This was due to the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals. On 22 April 1941, the territory was placed under the supreme authority of the German military commander in Serbia, with the day-to-day administration of the territory under the control of the chief of the military administration staff. The lines of command and control in the occupied territory were never unified, and were made more complex by the appointment of direct representatives of senior Nazi figures such as \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" Heinrich Himmler (for police and security matters), \\"Reichsmarschall\\" Hermann Göring (for the economy), and \\"Reichsminister\\" Joachim von Ribbentrop (for foreign affairs). The Germans used Bulgarian troops to assist in the occupation, but they were at all times under German control. Sources variously describe the territory as a puppet state, a protectorate, a \\"special administrative province\\", or describe it as having a puppet government. The military commander in Serbia had very limited German garrison troops and police detachments to maintain order, but could request assistance from a corps of three divisions of poorly-equipped occupation troops.  - The Russian Corps was an armed force composed of anti-Communist Russian émigrés in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia during World War II. Commanded by Lieutenant-General Boris Shteifon, it served primarily as a guard force from the autumn of 1941 until the spring of 1944. It was incorporated into the Wehrmacht on 1 December 1942 and later clashed with both the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetniks. In late 1944 it fought against the Red Army during the Belgrade Offensive, later withdrawing to Bosnia and Slovenia when the Germans withdrew from the Balkans. Shteifon was killed in April 1945 and was replaced by Colonel Anatoly Rogozhin, who subsequently managed to evade the Communists by surrendering to the British instead. He and his men were eventually set free and were allowed to resettle in the West.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.  - Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a \\"transitional\\" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe.  - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr.  - Belgrade is the capital and largest city of Serbia. It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, where the Pannonian Plain meets the Balkans. Its name translates to \\"White city\\". The urban area of the City of Belgrade has a population of 1.34 million, while over 1.65 million people live within its administrative limits.  - Albania (; ), officially the Republic of Albania, is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a population of 3.03 million as of 2016. Tirana is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Durrës and Vlorë. Albania is located in the south-western part of the Balkan peninsula, bordered by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south and southeast. The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins. Albania is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Boris Aleksandrovich Shteifon (6 December 1881  30 April 1945) was a general in the Imperial Russian Army, who subsequently served as a general in the Russian anti-communist White army, and as the leader of the Nazi-allied Russian Corps in Serbia during World War II.  - The Belgrade Offensive or the Belgrade Strategic Offensive Operation ( ) (14 September 1944  24 November 1944) was a military operation in which Belgrade was liberated from the German Wehrmacht through the joint efforts of the Soviet Red Army, Yugoslav Partisans, and the Bulgarian People's Army. Soviet forces and local militias launched separate but loosely cooperative operations that undermined German control of Belgrade and ultimately forced a retreat. Martial planning was coordinated evenly among command leaders, and the operation was largely enabled through tactical cooperation between Josip Tito and Joseph Stalin that began in September 1944. These martial provisions allowed Bulgarian forces to engage in operations throughout Yugoslav territory, which furthered tactical success while increasing diplomatic friction.   - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991.  - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.  - The Imperial Russian Army was the land armed force of the Russian Empire, active from around 1721 to the Russian Revolution of 1917. In the early 1850s, the Russian army consisted of more than 900,000 regular soldiers and nearly 250,000 irregulars (mostly Cossacks).  - Kosovo  is a disputed territory and partially recognised state in Southeast Europe that declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 as the Republic of Kosovo. Kosovo is landlocked in the central Balkan Peninsula. Its capital and largest city is Pristina. It is bordered by the Republic of Macedonia and Albania to the south, Montenegro to the west, and the uncontested territory of Serbia to the north and east. While Serbia recognises administration of the territory by Kosovo's elected government, it still continues to claim it as its own Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.  - Boris Aleksandrovich Shteifon ( December 6 , 1881 -- April 30 , 1945 ) ( Russian :    ) was a general in the Imperial Russian Army , who subsequently served as a general in the Russian anti-communist White army , and as the leader of the Nazi - allied Russian Corps in Serbia during World War II.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.

On Sundays, Danielle Goldman, 17, Studies the Science of Hanging Out Katie Orlinsky for The New York Times Danielle Goldman, 17, right, a senior at the Bronx High School of Science, prefers to finish her homework on Fridays so she can spend the weekend hanging out with friends. For Danielle Goldman, 17, a senior at the Bronx High School of Science, Sunday begins on Friday night, when she finishes her homework so she’ll have the weekend free. “I don’t wait till the last minute,” she said. This work ethic — along with a project that studied neurotransmitter levels in adolescents with mood disorders — helped make her one of 40 finalists in this year’s Intel Science Talent Search, which concludes on Tuesday. A 100,000 award will go to the winner. She lives in Astoria, Queens, with her parents and the family’s parrot, Puppy. She plans to attend Columbia College. Connect with us on Twitter for breaking news and headlines in New York. Danielle with her family's parrot, Puppy. \\"Basically Iâm up for anything whenever my friends want to hang out, because any time you spend with friends is fun,\\" she said. SWEET START I usually wake up around 10 or 11. I don’t have a set time, but oftentimes on Sunday my mom likes to make pancakes or French toast, so I like to wake up to the smell of that. She’s a very good cook. Chocolate chips or bananas — she surprises me. HELP OUT, OR NOT Sometimes I help cook, but sometimes I’m really exhausted from the week, so I just put on the TV while my mom cooks. Sometimes I watch the news; sometimes I have that kid in me that likes to watch the children’s shows in the morning. I watch “Arthur” on Channel 13 to bring back childhood memories. CHECK IN WITH FRIENDS After breakfast I usually check whether I have any e-mails or texts, see what my friends are up to. Basically I’m up for anything whenever my friends want to hang out, because any time you spend with friends is fun. Also, lately, since I became an Intel finalist, I’ve been using my parents to get a new wardrobe, so I’ve been going shopping a lot. THE MEET-UP We usually meet up around 1 or 2 o’clock, so we have the rest of the day to do whatever we had planned. Sometimes we have a set place to meet, but then we decide as we go along what we’re going to do. Last week we were meeting in Murray Hill. We didn’t know what we were going to do, but when we got there my friend decided, let’s go act like tourists. We went to Times Square; we went to the Empire State Building. We didn’t go to the top because it was closed, but we went to the stores around there, then we went to F. A. O. Schwarz, which was also fun. CASH I don’t have a job. No allowance. Whenever I need money I ask my parents, and usually they’re pretty open about it. THE GANG The group differs. I have a really close group of friends that I always can rely on, but I like catching up with the people I haven’t seen in a while — even kids that go to my school. It’s such a large school sometimes I can go weeks on end without seeing them; so I really want to catch up with those friends, too. Especially in this stressful time, with college applications. PARTING WAYS I like to do things after dinner, but a lot of my friends are the procrastinator type, and they have to get home and do all their homework, so I have to deal with that. INTO THE KITCHEN I usually bake when I get home. Sunday night I look through recipe books that my parents have from when they were young, and I try to conjure something up from those. They’re very fattening, but they’re good. I really love making black-and-white cookies. I have a Hershey’s cookbook from the ’80s. It’s really old-fashioned, but all the stuff I’ve made from there has turned out amazing. WINDING DOWN After that I usually lay down in bed and watch movies and really relax, not focus on any technology like social media. I don’t check e-mail. At night I want to make sure I can relax. I rent movies on iTunes and watch on my iPad. Sometimes I go into my parents’ bedroom and watch the movies with my mom. And when the movie is over I usually fall asleep, around 11, 12.

After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying. As Lindy rushes to the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, shaking his head. The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo. Although the entire camp looks for the baby, she is not found. Concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child, the Chamberlains struggle to accept God's decision and go on with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that Lindy murdered the baby. She is subsequently arrested and put on trial. How could this happen? This is a great depiction of real events that shows how \\"mob rule\\" is not a figment of the imagination. The entire country turns against the Chamberlains, in part because they are seen as odd. Streep gives her best performance ever as the complex Lindy, whose own strong-willed demeanor works against her every step of the way. Neill, likewise, does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael. The cast is one of the largest ever, with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into Lindy's case. The costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are all top of the line. If you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy that straight away. It is not a far cry from reality to say that this \\"Cry\\" should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media. Select from: 1). negative 2). positive","output":"The sentiment of the given review is 2). positive.  The review describes the film as a great depiction of real events and praises various aspects of the movie, such as the performances of Meryl Streep and Sam Neill, the large cast, costumes, scenery, script, direction, and production.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: America is a mobile society.Friendships between Americans can be close and real, yet disappear soon if situations change.Neither side feels hurt by this.Both may exchange Christmas greetings for a year or two, perhaps a few letters for a while --then no more.If the same two people meet again by chance, even years later, they pick up the friendship.This can be quite difficult for us Chinese to understand, because friendships between us flower more slowly but then may become lifelong feelings, extending sometimes deeply into both families.          Americans are ready to receive us foreigners at their homes, share their holidays, and their home life.They will enjoy welcoming us and be pleased if we accept their hospitality  easily. Another difficult point for us Chinese to understand Americans is that although they include us warmly in their personal everyday lives, they don't show their politeness to us if it requires a great deal of time.This is usually the opposite of the practice in our country where we may be  _ .Sometimes, we, as hosts, will appear at airports even in the middle of the night to meet a friend.We may take days off to act as guides to our foreign friends. The Americans, however, express their welcome usually at homes, but truly can not manage the time to do a great deal with a visitor outside their daily routine.They will probably expect us to get ourselves from the airport to our own hotel by bus.And they expect that we will phone them from there.Once we arrive at their homes, the welcome will be full, warm and real, We will find ourselves treated hospitably.For the Americans, it is often considered friendlier to invite a friend to their homes than to go to restaurants, except for purely business matters.So accept their hospitality at home! Question: A suitable title for this passage would probably be \\"  _  \\". Options: A: The mobility of Americans B: Treat Americans at home C: Americans' hospitality D: Americans' views of friendships The answer is:","output":"D: Americans' views of friendships The article primarily discusses the differences between how Americans and Chinese view and approach friendships, illustrating the ways in which Americans form and maintain connections with others, as well as how they express hospitality and politeness. This focus on the American perspective of friendships makes option D the most suitable title for the passage. While the other options touch on specific aspects mentioned in the article, they do not capture the overarching theme that permeates the entire passage.  Option A focuses on the mobility of Americans, which is mentioned at the beginning of the article, but it does not fully encompass the broader topic of friendships. Option B, \\"Treat Americans at home,\\" highlights a specific aspect of American hospitality but does not represent the wider theme of the passage. Similarly, option C, \\"Americans' hospitality,\\" emphasizes only one component of their approach to relationships and does not convey the complete picture of American friendships that the article seeks to present. In conclusion, the most appropriate title for this passage is \\"Americans' views of friendships,\\" as it accurately reflects the primary focus of the article and encompasses the various aspects covered within the text, such as the mobility of Americans, how they form and maintain friendships, and how they express hospitality and politeness in their relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Contact dermatitis usually shows up when you've been touched by a substance that triggers a reaction, like poison ivy or oak or latex gloves. The rash usually will crop up suddenly, within hours of contact. Possible answers: -- The rash usually looks worse in the morning, showing up as intricate blisters. Do not test for the rash in the morning when the rash is localized or has become infected.. -- It may also last for two to four weeks. There are two basic kinds of contact dermatitis, allergic or irritant.. -- It may last 24 hours, although it may take up to a week for an outbreak to occur. In the early stages, you might feel sick, or you may feel dizzy, or the rash may develop fuzzy gray patches on the face.. -- Likewise, rash in your fingers may blossom up in the event of an accidental contact.

Explanation: The most logical next event should continue the explanation of contact dermatitis symptoms and provide information about the duration and types of contact dermatitis. The first answer is incorrect because it contradicts the statement \\"The rash usually will crop up suddenly, within hours of contact\\" and suggests a specific time of day for the rash to appear worse, which is not relevant. The second part of the statement is also not logical as it suggests not to test for the rash in the morning. The third answer is incorrect because it provides an alternative duration which is not consistent with the typical duration of the rash. Additionally, it talks about feeling sick, dizzy, or developing fuzzy gray patches on the face, which are not common symptoms associated with contact dermatitis. The fourth answer is incorrect because it narrows down the reaction time to just the fingers and implies an identical duration of 24 hours for all cases, which is not accurate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: \\"You are what you eat,\\" says the old saying. So how can we know what food is healthy? Unluckily, a lot of food that looks good may have pollution. Where is the pollution from? It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing  it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat. Here's what happens: Most farmers use chemicals  to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident. Most drinks are just flavored water  . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat. In the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed. Often things are put into food to make it delicious and look good but they might be harmful to people. And some food like meat often gets polluted by bacteria.

What is the sentiment of this tweet?","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of sadness, concern, and a hint of dark humor. Here's an in-depth breakdown: 1. Sadness: The mention of a \\"rip kitty\\" suggests that the person who wrote the tweet feels sympathy for the cat they saw in the middle of the busy street. In this context, \\"rip\\" means \\"rest in peace,\\" which is often used as an expression of condolence when someone or something has passed away or is likely to pass away soon. The tweeter seems to recognize the precarious situation the cat is in, and this implies that they are saddened by it. 2. Concern: The tweet enunciates the cat's vulnerability to getting \\"smushed big time\\" due to its location in the middle of a busy street. This can potentially signify the author's worry for the animal's well-being. By drawing attention to the dangerous situation, they show genuine concern for the cat's fate. 3. Dark humor: Although sadness and concern are the primary sentiments expressed in the tweet, the phrasing and choice of words hint at a touch of dark humor. This is evident in the expression \\"smushed big time,\\" which brings forth a somewhat morbid visual while employing casual language. By using such informal wording, the tweet's author lessens the intensity of the grim situation, demonstrating a sense of dark humor in the face of a sad and concerning event. In summary, this tweet's sentiment is a combination of sadness and concern for the cat's well-being with a subtle hint of dark humor evident in the casual language used to describe the potential tragic outcome."},{"instruction":"Q:Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Step 3: Assess the relationship between candles and owl hunting Purchasing candles for a cake is an unrelated action to the owl's hunting process. Candles on a cake are typically used indoors and are not the same light source as natural nighttime light (moon, stars) that owls are adapted to.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the scholar that believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Montverdi piece?  In his personaggi listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group (che fecero la moresca nel fine). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza.","output":"In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that the Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter believes role-doublings were used in the performance of the Monteverdi piece. Therefore, the last name of the scholar is Carter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

It highlights the deployment of Marines and Navy personnel and the provision of essential supplies such as tents, water, and medical supplies to assist those affected by the flooding. The involvement of the US military in international humanitarian efforts is a crucial component of the country's global policies and diplomatic relationships. When natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, or earthquakes occur, countries with advanced resources and capabilities, like the United States, frequently offer assistance and humanitarian aid to affected regions. This not only benefits the recipient nation but also fosters goodwill and diplomatic relations between countries. The topic of world news often encompasses a wide range of subjects, including politics, diplomacy, humanitarian crises, and international conflicts. For instance, world news could cover events such as military actions, political agreements or disputes, war or peace negotiations, environmental disasters, population migration, and cultural developments. The excerpt in question specifically refers to an international event that involves both the United States and the Philippines, making it a part of world news.

Your equation is: -28*t - 66 = 5*t The first thing we want to do is to get all terms with \\"t\\" on one side of the equation and all the rest of the numbers on the other side. So, we can add 28*t (which is the same as 28 times t) to each side. This cancels out -28*t on the left side: -28*t + 28*t - 66 = 5*t + 28*t This simplifies to: -66 = 33*t  Next, we want to put \\"t\\" all by itself. We do that by dividing each side by 33: -66 / 33 = 33*t / 33 Which simplifies to: -2 = t So, the solution to the equation is t = -2, meaning if we replace t with -2 in the original equation, it will be correct."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Italian.

The Internet was awash with products offering protection from the deadly virus which has so far claimed one life in the U.S. An infectious disease doctor today rubbished the panic-buying of 'Ebola protection kits' as a waste of money, saying the only use the general public will have for a hazmat suit is as a Halloween costume. Protective suits, face masks and survival kits have been flying off the shelves amid increasing panic over Ebola in the U.S. after one sufferer died on Wednesday and two remained hospitalized. A total of 48 are being monitored for contagious symptoms. Online commerce sites are awash with isolation gowns, surgical masks, booties and duct tape claiming to offer full protection from the deadly virus. There has also been a huge buy-up in preparation kits and supplies. Kits often contain a mix of surgical masks, gloves, bio-hazard bags and sanitizer wipes. And the price of protection isn't cheap - while a basic Ebola protective kit costs around 50 per person, one high-level protection suit is selling on Amazon for 1,300. The bright blue suit, which appears more suited to a space mission than a trip to the mall, is described as a 'Level A Suite'. It has a back-entry PVC face shield, attached gloves and three-layers of fabric with 'proprietary barrier films, spunbond nonwoven substrate and inner barrier films'. However University of Pittsburgh infectious disease expert, Dr Amesh Adalja, told MailOnline today the suits only use would be as a Halloween costume. Dr Adalja, who sits on the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said: '[The suits] are a waste of money. 'Ebola does not pose a risk to the general public because it is not contagious unless you come in contact with the bodily fluids of a symptomatic individual.' He said that people on the street have little to fear because the virus doesn't spread like the common cold. He advised Americans to be more concerned with getting their flu vaccines - an infection which kills thousands of people each year. Dr Adalja added: 'Buying hazmat suits is for a very far-fetched scenario but it's not going to stop people from buying them. 'A suit won't have much use other than as a Halloween costume.' Dr Alexis Thomas, who practises in London, also said that there was little use in protective suits for the general public. She said: 'Panic buying of personal protective clothing e.g. hazmat suits is unnecessary and inappropriate. 'Ebola is transmitted via direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. 'Unless you are going to be caring directly for someone who has Ebola symptoms and has a high risk of having the disease due to recent travel from an endemic region, buying or wearing a hazmat suit is unnecessary and just helps to further fuel ill-informed hysteria.'

Med-Tech Resource's Ebola kit, which sells for 24.99, is described on their website as the 'ultimate protection and prevention kit for Ebola, influenza, and other outbreaks' Mountainside Medical Equipment was promoting an Ebola Virus Protection Kit - which came with ten dollars off at 19.95 and included gloves, disinfectant and a biohazard waste bag. A number of sites were quick to target the Ebola market. Mountainside Medical Equipment was promoting an 'Ebola Virus Protection Kit' - which came discounted at 19.95. A representative for the company told MailOnline today that the kit was for 'personal protection' but the company couldn't '100 per cent guarantee protection against Ebola'. Another site, Med-Tech Resource, sells their Ebola Kit for 25, with the words: 'The ultimate protection and prevention kit for Ebola, influenza, and other outbreaks. 'Approved by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), our kit includes everything you need to help prevent the spread of Ebola.' A representative from the company refused to comment to MailOnline today when asked about the number of kits which had been sold online. 'Expert' survival guides on how to survive Ebola are being self-published and sold on Amazon - close to 40 have been published in the last month alone. Then there's the literature where the majority of titles appear to be written by self-professed experts. For about 50, this Ebola kit can be bought online and claims to protect against the virus. One title, 'Ebola: Natural Remedies + Government Conspiracies', poses the question: 'The Ebola virus is here on U.S. soil, why was it welcomed here by the CDC? ... What are they trying to hide?' Another publication, 'Ebola Survival Guide 2015: 10 Things you Must Know to Survive the Coming Ebola Outbreak!' comes with a warning label on the cover: 'Ebola could infect 4.1 billion people over the next 24 months!' In the last 30 days alone, around 40 new Ebola titles have been self-published to be bought as e-books on Amazon. Dr Adalja refused to comment on specific publications which he had not reviewed but advised those with concerns about Ebola to look at the WHO and CDC websites, which has a wealth of scientifically-verified information on the virus. The CDC reported on Wednesday that it is being flooded with more than 800 calls per day from local health workers and patients who are desperate to know if symptoms including headaches, fever and nausea are Ebola. Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, became America's 'patient zero' on Wednesday after he was the first person to die from Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The Liberian national had arrived in the country on September 20 and was finally hospitalized on September 28 with infection symptoms, after being initially sent home from the hospital with antibiotics. Some 48 people, who were in contact with Mr Duncan, are now being monitored, with ten being considered high-risk. On Wednesday, a Dallas sheriff's deputy, who was not among the 48 being monitored, attended an urgent-care clinic in Frisco, Texas, with Ebola-like symptoms. Ebola test results are pending for Sgt Michael Monnig. Five U.S. citizens have been diagnosed with Ebola and three of them have beaten the virus. Doctors Kent Brantly and Rick Sacra, along with missionary aid worker, Nancy Writebol, were all flown back from Liberia to be treated in U.S. hospitals this summer. They have since received the all-clear. NBC News cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, the latest American victim, was quarantined at Nebraska Medical Center on Monday after being flown in from Liberia. A fourth victim, a World Health Organization doctor, is being treated in Atlanta. Close to 3,500 people have died from Ebola in West Africa following the outbreak in December 2013 in Guinea. The concern over Ebola echoed the reaction more than a decade ago to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The disease infected about 8,000 people in 2003, killing nearly 800.

Not just because it was ten years ago, but also because it's such a great story to share. Why? I think the main reason is that admitting mistakes makes you easier to relate to. Interestingly enough, science confirms _ . Researchers have conducted many studies and have concluded that when someone makes a mistake or acts in a clumsy way, they are found to be more likeable. In other words, if you're able to do well and then you mess up, it shows your human side. This allows others to connect and relate to you, which in turn makes them like you more. Growing up, I was type of student who had to get straight A's and the type of athlete who always had to perform at the top of the game. The problem was that my standards were so ridiculously high that I was never happy. It was only when I learned to let go and forgive myself for my mistakes that I truly felt relaxed. When one of your close friends or family members makes a mistake, are you quick to forgive and forget? Sadly, many of us often express more sympathy for others than ourselves. With each mistake coming a lesson, you will be better equipped to handle life's challenges going forward. More importantly, if you are always worried about looking silly, you will never be able to get improved. Even if you make a fool of yourself, it isn't the end of the world.

Context: QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services, and some only offer take-out and delivery. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.   - Object manipulation is a form of dexterity play or performance in which one or more people physically interact with one or more objects. Many object manipulation skills are recognised circus skills. Other object manipulation skills are linked to sport, magic, and everyday objects or practices. Many object manipulation skills use special props made for that purpose: examples include the varied circus props such as balls, clubs, hoops, rings, poi, staff, and devil sticks; magic props such as cards and coins; sports equipment such as nunchaku and footballs. Any other object can also be used for manipulation skills. Object manipulation with ordinary items may be considered to be object manipulation when the object is used out of its socially acknowledged context and used differently from its original purpose.  - Philip Astley (8 January 1742  27 January 1814) was an English equestrian, circus owner, and inventor, regarded as being the \\"father of the modern circus\\". The circus industry, as a presenter of an integrated entertainment experience that includes music, domesticated animals, acrobats, and clowns, traces its heritage to Astley's Amphitheatre, a riding school that Astley founded in London following the success of his invention of the circus ring in 1768.  - Clowns are comic performers who employ slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style.  - H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - Dinner theater (sometimes called dinner and a show) is a form of entertainment that combines a restaurant meal with a staged play or musical. Sometimes the play is incidental entertainment, secondary to the meal, in the style of a sophisticated night club, or the play may be a major production with dinner less important, or in some cases, optional. Dinner theater requires the management of three distinct entities: a live theater, a restaurant, and usually, a bar.  - A circus is a company of performers that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, unicyclists, as well as other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists. The term 'circus' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Philip Astley is credited with being the 'father' of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The 'traditional' format, whereby a ringmaster introduces a varied selection of acts that mostly perform choreographed acts to traditional music, developed in the latter part of 19th century and continued almost universally to be the main style of circus up until the 1970s.  - A trapeze is a short horizontal bar hung by ropes or metal straps from a support. It is an aerial apparatus commonly found in circus performances. Trapeze acts may be static, spinning (rigged from a single point), swinging or flying, and may be performed solo, double, triple or as a group act.

Patricia always kept a wider tooth comb than Sarah, as","output":"Patricia always kept a wider tooth comb than Sarah, as she recognized numerous benefits specific to her hair type, styling preferences, and daily routine that the wider tooth comb provided. The wider spacing between each tooth in the comb worked exceptionally well for Patricia's distinctive hair texture, density, and length. As someone with thicker, curlier, and coarser hair strands, Patricia found that utilising a wider tooth comb was essential in maintaining and optimizing her hair health. First and foremost, the wider tooth comb catered to Patricia's needs by effectively reducing the amount of breakage and damage her hair would experience during detangling sessions. The wider spacing allowed the comb to navigate through her hair fibers with greater ease and less tension. Consequently, this reduced the risk of snapping or tearing her strands as she meticulously detangled her tresses. The gentle action of the wider tooth comb not only promoted overall hair health, but it also helped in maintaining her hair's natural elasticity and strength. Additionally, the wider tooth comb proved useful in preserving Patricia's stunning curls. As the comb effortlessly glided through her hair, it minimized the potential of disrupting her curl pattern and creating unwanted frizz. By contrast, Sarah utilized finer-toothed combs, which could disrupt the delicate balance of her curls and smoothen her waves in an undesirable way. A wider tooth comb provided Patricia with the essential control she needed to show off her beautiful, bouncy curls. Moreover, Patricia was aware of the importance of maintaining her hair's natural oils and moisture balance, which could be easily disrupted by a finer-toothed comb. The wider tooth comb effortlessly distributed her hair's oils with every stroke, ensuring a lustrous and healthy shine. The even distribution of oils along her hair shafts also helped to combat dryness and brittleness, common issues faced by individuals with thick and curly hair types. Furthermore, Paticia was often in a hurry and needed to get her hair ready quickly. The wider tooth comb came in handy to save time, as it efficiently slid through her hair, taking less time as it allowed for a quicker detangling experience without causing any harm to her hair. In conclusion, Patricia always kept a wider tooth comb than Sarah, as it proved to be a valuable tool for her particular hair type and styling preferences. The comb not only facilitated gentler detangling of her thick, curly locks, but also preserved her hair's natural curl pattern, reduced frizz, maintained moisture balance, and allowed for swift styling. Patricia's choice of a wider tooth comb showcased her deep understanding of her hair's unique needs and the importance of using the right tools to ensure optimal hair health and appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Of this group, the focus is on Jack Kelley (Christian Bale),who one day dreams of heading out west to the wide-open spaces of Santa Fe.One day, Jack meets Les Jacobs (Luke Edwards) and David Jacobs (David Moscow), two brothers who've turned to selling newspapers to support their family, after their father was fired when a machine accident left him unable to work. Jack soon teaches Les and Jacobs some interesting lessons about how to sell papers (such as sensationalizing headlines).Shortly afterwards, the boys are challenged when the 'World' newspaper's owner, Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall), raises their purchase rate by 1/10 of a cent. Though seemingly a drop in the bucket for Pulitzer (who hopes to use the added funds to keep competing with his closest competitor, William Randolph Hearst), the increase is a significant price gouge for the Newsies. With David supplying input and ideas, Jack becomes the leader of the group. The boys then go to other parts of New York to rally other newsboy groups, with Jack and David going to Brooklyn to recruit Spot Conlon (Gabriel Damon) and his group. Even with David's enthusiasm, Spot is still doubtul about joining them.At the same time, the boys catch the eye of Bryan Denton (Bill Pullman), a reporter for the 'New York Sun.' Denton soon becomes the boy's champion, making the 'Sun' the only newspaper in New York covering the newsboy strike.In one incident that gets Pulitzer's attention, the boys cause havoc at a newspaper distribution center, that calls the police to the scene. One of the newsboys, Crutchy (Marty Belafsky), is captured and taken to a place called 'The Refuge,' which is operated by Warden Snyder (Kevin Tighe). While told to be a place to rehabilitate young boys, it is actually a place where its keepers take advantage of the system, pocketing extra money for every boy they bring in, as well as not allowing the boys to partake in more nourishing food.

These lands often include fields, forests, meadows, and sometimes mountains and plains as well. While driving through the countryside, you are likely to experience vast expanses of open space, providing a clear view of the natural landscape, including mountains and plains. Let's discuss the other options: 1. Middle America: This option refers to a region in North America, primarily made up of the United States' central states. While you might see plains and mountains when driving through certain parts of middle America, this option isn't specifically about the environment or landscape. 2. Beach: A beach is a specific landform along the coastline where the sea meets the land. It is characterized by sand or other small rock particles. The primary feature of a beach is the sea and sand, not the plains and mountains that you are looking for. 3. Landscape: A landscape can refer to any area with distinct features, including urban, suburban, rural, forests, and even agricultural lands. However, this term is too broad and doesn't provide the specific answer you are looking for. 4. Georgia: While Georgia (either the U.S. state or the European country) might have some attraction with plains and/or mountains, the answer is not exclusively related to this area, since plains and mountains can be found in other places as well.

Managing the NHS was the top result, with 42% ranking it in their top three. That's slightly less than the 50% of the general British public who believe the NHS should be a top priority. The survey by ComRes interviewed 6,345 British adults aged 18-24 online in February 2015. Thirty-three per cent of young adults chose \\"Keeping the cost of everyday items, such as food, energy and travel\\" in their top three - compared to 23% of the general population. Despite \\"Improving the education system\\" being the lowest priority for the public as a whole (9%) it's the fourth highest among 18 to 24-year-olds. Almost a quarter (24%) said it should be a top three priority. The results suggest young adults are more concerned than everyone else about the cost of everyday items, improving education, housing affordability, making the welfare system fairer and reducing crime. Controlling immigration was their third highest priority with 28% putting it on their list. That's much lower than the 49% of the general population who feel it should be a priority. The general public figures are based on a ComRes survey of 2,039 adults (aged 18+) carried out in January 2015 and weighted accordingly. Newsbeat's politics reporter Greg Dawson said: \\"The survey findings reflect what young adults across the country have been telling us in recent months. \\"Many are struggling to afford to rent, let alone buy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: BIOLOGICAL evolution happens by random mutation and selection. Technological evolution involves selection, too. Products preferred by customers are the ones that reproduce. But since technology is the product of conscious design, the mutation part of the process might reasonably be assumed to be deliberate rather than random.      A study just published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society suggests, however, that this is not always the case. Nicholas Makris and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Roman Barnas, a violin maker at the North Bennet Street School, in Boston, have been looking at the evolution of that instrument. One aspect of the process intrigued them in particular—the changing shape, over the years, of the holes in a violin’s body that allow the sound to emerge.      Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.                                          The violin’s oldest European ancestors date from the tenth century. They were called “fitheles”, a word derived from vitula, the Latin for heifer, the source of the gut for the strings. (The Latin word also eventually gave rise to “violin”; “fitheles”, meanwhile, became “fiddle” in a process of linguistic speciation also akin to the biological sort.) The instrument arrived at its modern form between the 16th and the 18th centuries, in the workshops of Cremona, a city in northern Italy that produced the Amati, Guarneri and Stradivari dynasties of luthiers.      Dr Makris and his team noticed that, in the transition from tenth-century fithele to 18th-century violin, the holes on top of the sound box evolved from simple circles to the complex, elongated f-shapes familiar in today’s instruments. They wondered why.      The answer, arrived at after several pages of advanced mathematics, and confirmed by experiment, is that holes’ sound-amplification properties depend not on their areas but on the lengths of their peripheries. They showed how the shape of the hole varied over the centuries, and how that affected its power output. The final Cremonese design had twice the sonic power of the circular holes of the fithele.      Except that Dr Makris doubts “design” is precisely the right word for what happened. Design implies intent. But his analysis of 470 Cremonese instruments made between 1560 and 1750 suggests, as the chart shows, that change was gradual—and consistent, in Dr Makris’s view, with random variations in craftsmen’s techniques producing instruments of different power. The market, presumably, favoured those journeymen within a workshop who made more powerful instruments. When they became masters in their turn, they then passed their ways of doing things on to their own apprentices. Only at the very end of the period might a deliberate change have been made, as the holes get suddenly longer.      Intriguingly, intentional attempts in the 19th century to fiddle further with the f-holes’ designs actually served to make things worse, and did not endure. As is also the case with living organisms, mutation and selection seem to have arrived at an optimal result. ||||| To this day the violins made by the Italian masters Antonio Stradivari, Giuseppe Guarneri Del Gesuin and Andrea Amati are regarded as among the finest musical instruments ever made.      Now an analysis of nearly 500 violins has found that their characteristic tone and sound is likely to have come about as a result of tiny errors made each time the trio’s craftsmen tried to replicate the original blueprint for their production.      Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that vital to the sound of what is now commonly known as a Stradivarius violin is the shape and length of the it’s f-shaped holes, through which air escapes.      The more elongated these holes are, the more noise the instrument can produce.      This sound hole was found to be more power efficient than the rounder openings of earlier medieval fiddles, lyres and rebecs - as well as taking up less space on the instrument.      The thickness of a violin's back plate also contributes to its acoustic power, with a thicker back plate boosting a violin's sound.      MIT’s researchers found that violins from the 17th and 18th century 'golden age' crafted by Amati, Stradivari and Guarneri’s workshops, in the city of Cremona, slowly evolved so that the f-shaped holes became more elongated and the back plates became thicker.      But a computer model of the evolution of the trio’s instruments’ over time, compiled using the measurements of technical drawings of Cremonese-era violins from museums, collector databases and books, as well as X-ray and CAT scans of the instruments, suggests these small alterations were, initially at least, unintentional.      In other words, the makers may have created violins with longer sound holes and thicker back plates not by design, but by accident.      Professor Nicholas Makris, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: \\"We found if you try to replicate a sound hole exactly from the last one you made, you will always have a little error.      \\"You are cutting with a knife into thin wood and you cannot get it perfectly, and the error we report is about two per cent.\\"      What is not yet known is to what extent, if at all, violin makers realised that by making such tiny changes they could improve the tone and volume of the instrument they were crafting.      Comparisons between the sound of two different instruments made by the same maker may have led to attempts to copy one rather than the other, leading to attempts to replicate the characteristically elongated f-shaped hole and thicker base plate.      Prof Makris, who was assisted by violinmakers from the North Bennet Street School in Boston, said: \\"People had to be listening, and had to be picking things that were more efficient, and were making good selection of what instrument to replicate.      \\"Whether they understood, 'Oh, we need to make the sound hole more slender,' we cannot say. But they definitely knew what was a better instrument to replicate.\\"      The researchers looked at instruments made by Stradivari, Amati and Guarneri because the consensus among experts and critics is that they are the best violins ever made.      They did not examine other violins from the period, so it remains unclear whether other craftsmen were also making similar changes and developments to the shape and design of their instruments, with equal success in improving their sound and tone.      Prof Makris, originally an expert in ocean acoustics, became involved in the latest research after taking up playing the lute a decade ago.      The study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, took seven years to complete and involved examining the acoustic dynamics of stringed instruments from the oud, lute, and medieval fiddles to the guitar and ultimately the violin, a period spanning 8OO years.      During this period sound-hole shape evolved from a simple round shape to a semicircle, which eventually morphed into a c-shape. This grew more elongated, until it ultimately became the f-shape of the violin that we recognise today.      Prof Makris' team also found the overall shape of the violin's ancestors slowly evolved to be more powerful and more acoustically efficient, although again not necessarily by design.            David Aaron Carpenter plays the \\"Macdonald\\" Stradivarius (AFP/Getty)      He said: \\"We think these changes are still within the possibility of natural mutation. All of these subtle parameters of shape, we have modelled, and are able to make very good predictions on what the effects will be on frequency and power.\\"      The conclusions of Prof Makris’s research may assist contemporary master violin makers looking to design more powerful, fuller-sounding instruments.      But he warned that some of the Italian masters’ secret may never by fully unlocked – and that may be no bad thing.      \\"Mystery is good, and there is magic in violin making. Some makers, I do not know how they do it, it is an art form. They have their techniques and methods. But here, for us, it is good to understand scientifically as much as you can,” said Prof Makrin.      Stradivarius violins can today be worth millions when sold on the open market.      In 2011, his \\"Lady Blunt\\" violin from 1721 - named after Lord Byron's granddaughter Lady Anne Blunt, who owned it for 30 years – was auctioned for £9.8 million by the Nippon Music Foundation in aid of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami appeal. ||||| Could violins, like animals, have evolved?      The answer is yes, according to a team of researchers led by MIT professor Nicholas Makris.      Dr. Makris collaborated with the violin making and repair program at North Bennet Street School to study the acoustic properties of violins and violin ancestors. Their research, which appears in Proceedings of the Royal Society A, shows that a violin’s acoustic power is linked to the shape of the holes in its body.      Perhaps more surprisingly, it also suggests that the violin’s distinctive, f-shaped sound hole came not as a result of human ingenuity, but rather a series of random mutations.      In 17th century Italy, master builders – the Amati, Stradivari, and Guarneri families most notably – ushered in the golden age of violinmaking. This era, called the Cremonese period, produced some of the most sought-after musical instruments of all time. Many players and makers assert that the quality of these instruments are unmatched by modern successors – although that notion has been heavily disputed.      Violin design has changed relatively little since the Cremonese period. So it is surprising, to say the least, that researchers are still working to understand their intricacies.      “We have looked back over a couple of hundred years of literature on violin acoustics,” Makris says. “There are formulas, derived by [Victorian polymath] Lord Rayleigh about one hundred years ago, for the resonance frequency of circle and elliptical sound holes, but nothing for power. And that seems to sum the previous knowledge.”      Makris’ research focuses on violins, but was spurred by a different, older instrument. The lute is a medieval stringed instrument with a round sound hole. They look a little bit like guitars – except many lutes feature intricate carvings called rosettes over their sound holes. After being approached by a professional player who wanted to understand the effects of the rosette on sound and volume, Makris took the case.      In musical instruments, volume and power are related to airflow – in other words, instruments that push a greater volume of air through their sound holes will be noticeably louder. With the help of Yuming Liu, a principal research scientist at MIT, Makris’s team modeled airflow through sample sound holes. In doing so, they were able to determine the power efficiency of different lutes.      In time, Makris realized that air would flow faster near the perimeter of a sound hole and much slower at the center. So it didn’t matter if the sound hole was open or covered in rosette carvings – there was virtually no difference in volume.      Further testing on more diverse sound holes – like those of Cremonese violins – confirmed the notion that airflow was maximized at a sound hole’s perimeter and negligible in its interior.      “So more perimeter and less interior area is better,” Makris says. “That is, for the same area of wood you cut to make the sound hole, a shape that has larger perimeter and less interior area will lead to more sound generation. The circle has the smallest perimeter for the same area, and so is the least power-efficient.”      Slender f-holes minimize interior area, so they are naturally more power efficient than round sound holes of the same perimeter. As a result, violins tend to be much louder than lutes.      “One way to understand the efficiency is to think about what happens near a tall building on a windy day,” Makris adds. “It tends to be far windier at the perimeter of the building rather than some distance from the building, because all the air flow obstructed by the building escapes in a concentrated region at the edges. Something similar is going on with the sound holes of musical instruments.”      The thickness of a violin’s back plate also factors into power efficiency, the team found. Violins expand and contract as they are played, thereby generating sound within the body. As the instrument expands, it pushes air through the f-holes.      “The problem is that when the violin contracts, its body sucks air towards it,” Makris says. “This has a canceling effect on some of the air being squeezed out of the f-hole, which reduces the sound. A thicker back plate reduces this cancellation by [reducing] the expansion and contraction of the violin body, and so makes the net acoustic power radiated outwards greater.”      The finding is supported by chronology – from Amati to Stradivari to Guarneri, violins slowly developed thicker back plates and more slender f-holes. But it wasn’t so much a conscious transition as it was natural selection, Makris says.      For most of human history, instrument making was a deeply personal, individual art. Every lute and violin would have been made by hand – none could be exactly the same as another.      “We found that if you try to replicate a sound hole exactly from the last one you made, you'll always have a little error,” Makris said in a press release. “You're cutting with a knife into thin wood and you can't get it perfectly, and the error we report is about two percent ... always within what would have happened if it was an evolutionary change, accidentally from random fluctuations.”      Makris’s personal fascination with musical instruments belies him. As a professor of ocean engineering at MIT, he focuses on ocean exploration by way of acoustics, not on musical design. But according to Makris, these two interests aren’t as disparate as they might seem.      “It all comes from the same first physical principles of physics,” Makris says. “Experience in one definitely helps with intuition in the other. I think there is a tendency nowadays to overspecialize or to expect overspecialization. Go back to the times of Lord Rayleigh and you will find musical acoustics prominently at the beginning of his classic books on the mathematical physics of the theory of sound. What we have done to help understand musical instruments also answers questions about more general sources of sound, including those underwater.”      But it takes more than textbook physics to design a Stradivarius-level violin. Some, including Makris, believe there’s something almost intangible about a well-crafted instrument.      “There is something very beautiful in the natural sounds of wooden instruments that is difficult and will be difficult to quantify over a wide frequency range,” Makris says. “What we have done pertains to a lower frequency register that is an important starting point.”      Lutherie, the art of building stringed instruments, is still an imperfect study. Makris hopes his research will meet a “growing demand” from musicians who seek to understand the properties of wooden instruments.      “I think our work actually can help many players and makers with simple practical decisions about sound hole size and shape,” Makris suggests, “and perhaps also certain choices of wood type and thickness. I have also heard from violin makers who know about our findings that design changes they made based on them have led to happy customers.”      “But the makers have the magic and I try not to interfere for the most part,” Makris adds. “They know so much, but so much of their work is an art form that is not so easy to communicate. But I still try to ask questions and learn as much as I can.”      Consumer interest in luthier-made instruments has rebounded in recent years, but most players still get their axes off the assembly line. If the evolution of violins was caused by human error, could mass production halt the progress of instrument design?      “When I was younger, I could not afford to have an instrument made and had to have mass-produced ones, which clearly serve an important niche,” Makris says. \\"So you essentially need a portion of the population that is capable of supporting arts and high level craftsmanship to maintain progress.”      Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

A group of researchers studied violins, the ones with the beautiful sound that people love to listen to. They were curious about the shape of the holes on the violin's front, which let the sound come out. Over time, these holes changed from circles to the fancy f-shapes we see today. The researchers wanted to know why this happened. They did some math and experiments, and found out that having an longer hole with a fancy shape made the sound even better! But, the interesting part is that this change wasn't planned. It happened slowly and accidentally because of tiny mistakes made by violin makers. As the violin's design became better by chance, more people liked them and wanted more fancy-shaped hole violins. So, violins didn't change their shape on purpose. It was like nature, where little animals change by accident and the ones with the best changes have more babies. In this case, the violins with the best holes became more popular and made more beautiful music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Colombian Company of Air Navigation, formed in 1919, was the second commercial airline in the world. It was not until the 1940s that Colombias air transportation began growing significantly in the number of companies, passengers carried, and kilometers covered. In the early 2000s, an average of 72 percent of the passengers transported by air go to national destinations, while 28 percent travel internationally. One notable feature is that after the reforms of the beginning of the 1990s, the number of international passengers tripled by 2003. In 1993 the construction, administration, operation, and maintenance of the main airports transferred to departmental authorities and the private sector, including companies specializing in air transportation. Within this process, in 2006 the International Airport Operator (Opain), a Swiss-Colombian consortium, won the concession to manage and develop Bogotá’s El Dorado International Airport. El Dorado is the largest airport in Latin America in terms of cargo traffic (33rd worldwide), with 622,145 metric tons in 2013, second in terms of traffic movements (45th worldwide) and third in terms of passengers (50th among the busiest airports in the world). In addition to El Dorado, Colombia’s international airports are Palo Negro in Bucaramanga, Simón Bolívar in Santa Marta, Cortissoz in Barranquilla, Rafael Núñez in Cartagena, José María Córdova in Rionegro near Medellín, Alfonso Bonilla Aragón in Cali, Alfredo Vásquez Cobo in Leticia, Matecaña in Pereira, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in San Andrés, and Camilo Daza in Cúcuta.

Although it may seem like a simple task to reiterate the given sentence with proper capitalization, it's also important to understand the underlying sentiment expressed. In today's fast-paced society and constant exposure to various media, people often feel saturated with content and subsequently find it difficult to discover new pieces of music that can genuinely complement and augment a special event or occasion. Factors such as personal preferences, cultural influences, and the ever-changing landscape of music genres make it an ongoing challenge to find that perfect track or composition that truly resonates with an individual's emotions and uplifts the atmosphere at any memorable gathering. Various streaming platforms and music discovery algorithms, while helpful in providing tailored recommendations, can sometimes overlook less mainstream or niche compositions that might have the potential to captivate an audience. Moreover, the sheer volume of content available can make it overwhelming for listeners to sift through, leading to a reduced chance of uncovering that unique gem of a musical piece. To counteract this phenomenon and ensure that one can stumble upon new and enchanting music that enhances a special occasion, several strategies can be employed. Attending live performances, such as concerts, operas, or music festivals, can expose listeners to novel compositions and unique renditions of familiar tracks. Networking with fellow music enthusiasts and joining dedicated online forums or social media groups can lead to sharing and exchanging recommendations, thereby introducing new artists and genres to one's musical repertoire. Investing time in exploring less-known artists and genres can increase the likelihood of discovering hidden masterpieces, as a significant portion of these works remain underappreciated and unexplored. Additionally, making an effort to understand the historical context, cultural significance, and intrinsic artistic values behind various musical compositions can lead to a deeper appreciation and connection with the piece, eventually contributing to its ability to enrich a special occasion. In conclusion, while it may be challenging to find a new piece of music that truly enhances a special occasion in the current era, taking a proactive approach in exploring diverse musical landscapes, engaging with fellow enthusiasts, and cultivating an appreciation for the varying facets of music and its creators can help uncover riveting and transformative compositions. As one embarks on this musical journey, they are more likely to come across pieces that resonate with their emotions, leaving a lasting impression and elevating the essence of any memorable event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jorge Ramos’s Long Game On a Tuesday morning earlier this month, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., waited near a side entrance of the Tent City Jail, the open-air compound he operates in Phoenix. Several female inmates were lined up before him, hands behind their backs, ankles linked by chains. The women wore black-and-white-striped prison uniforms — the kind of throwbacks tourists don for photographs near Alcatraz — with the words “Sheriff’s Inmate” on their backs. Arpaio wore a black suit, black shoes and a white shirt. He looked as if he had raided Johnny Cash’s closet. Arpaio, now 22 years into his controversial tenure in Maricopa County, has proclaimed himself “America’s toughest sheriff”; he is surely its most media-savvy. That morning, he was outside to greet a film crew from the Miami headquarters of the Spanish-language network Univision. Later, while the cameras gathered scene-setting shots, Arpaio prompted the inmates to request signed copies of Tent City Jail’s campy postcards. “Make sure I do sign your card,” Arpaio told his chain gang. “It’ll be worth something.” Around the corner from Arpaio, near a bright yellow sign that read “No Outlet,” two producers and two cameramen huddled with the Univision anchorman Jorge Ramos, running through their pre-interview preparations. Cameras rolling. Microphone on. “I’m on TV,” Ramos told me later. “I’m constantly thinking about performance and journalistic integrity.” For him, one is no use without the other. At 57, Ramos may be the most influential news anchor in the Americas. He has been awarded eight Emmys and has interviewed more than 60 presidents from almost every country in the two continents. For 29 years he has co-anchored Univision’s flagship Spanish-language news broadcast, “Noticiero Univisión,” which averages 1.9 million viewers and often grabs higher ratings than English-language newscasts in cities with large numbers of Latinos, like Phoenix. Ramos also hosts Univision’s Sunday morning news program, “Al Punto,” as well as an English-language news program, “America with Jorge Ramos” on Univision’s sister network, Fusion. His interview with Arpaio would run on all three shows. But most non-Spanish-speaking Americans probably know Ramos best as the journalist who was thrown out of Donald Trump’s press conference in Dubuque, Iowa, in August. Ramos had tried to ask Trump — who had recently declared that “anchor babies” were not American citizens and that he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants — about his immigration proposals. Trump told Ramos to sit down; Ramos refused. “I have the right to ask a question,” he said. Trump shot back, “Go back to Univision,” before signaling for a guard to remove Ramos from the room. It was a remarkable exchange, and the optics of it weren’t entirely accidental. Ramos arrived almost two hours early to grab a seat in the front row while his team set up two cameras: one to film Trump and one to film Ramos. Even before Trump entered the room, Ramos knew he would stand up when he asked his question. He’d studied Trump, he told me, and noticed that it was easier for Trump to silence reporters when they were sitting down. He also wanted to be equal to Trump, visually, and to be miked separately so that, for his audiences at least, his voice would be as loud as Trump’s. When I suggested that such preparations turned the news into a kind of contrived performance, Ramos countered that performance was very different from acting. Television news, he argued, can’t be wholly improvised. Flights need to be booked. Press passes must be requested and approved. “TV doesn’t happen,” he said. “You produce TV.” And if the cameras are not rolling, there is no story. To prove his point, he cited the case of The Des Moines Register, the Iowa newspaper that was denied press credentials for at least one Trump campaign event after it published an editorial titled “Trump Should Pull the Plug on His Bloviating Side Show.” “What’s more important?” Ramos asked me: the ejection of one reporter or the exclusion of an entire newspaper? Yet for the average television viewer, The Des Moines Register incident might as well never have happened. It occurred off-camera. Ramos wanted to ask Arpaio about the Department of Justice’s recent finding that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s office singled out Latinos for traffic stops (and thus, indirectly, for deportations), called Latino prisoners “wetbacks” and “Mexican bitches” and failed to adequately respond to allegations of sexual violence against female prisoners. Arpaio, for his part, seemed excited about the opportunity to argue with Ramos, announcing their interview on Twitter a week before it happened. “In fact, I was hoping all the media would come,” Arpaio told me. “But he asked me not to do that.” Arpaio had even tried to get Donald Trump to join the interview. (Trump declined.) Here, in microcosm, was the new terrain of American immigration politics. Since the 1990s, Univision’s domination of the Spanish-language broadcast market has made Ramos and his co-anchor, Maria Elena Salinas, figures of great interest for presidential campaigns. (In 2014, “Noticiero Unvisión” had more than twice the average daily audience as its closest competitor, Telemundo’s “Noticiero Telemundo.”) Politicians saw Ramos as a kind of emissary from that vague territory known as the Hispanic vote; acceding to an interview was a way of telegraphing that they took the concerns of Latinos seriously and valued their approval. But the advent of Trump, whose tirades about border-crossing rapists seem to have only improved his standing in the polls, has turned this relationship on its head. Now talking back to Ramos about “illegals” can be a politically valuable bit of theater, and it isn’t bad press for Ramos, either. Watching the footage of Trump ejecting Ramos from the Dubuque press conference, my husband observed that the scenario could not have served each party better if they had agreed to a script. Ramos shone like a hero to his followers. Trump shone like a hero to his. “I want to ask you a favor,” Arpaio said to Ramos. “I know you’re popular. You’re a journalist. I respect you.” They sat inside the open-air prison at a square picnic table shaded by a canvas tent. Around them, the cameramen adjusted angles and microphones in near-90-degree heat. “I want to go to Mexico,” Arpaio said. “Can you get someone to welcome me?” “They don’t like me so much,” Ramos replied. Once the tape was rolling, Ramos began with one of his signature polite, ferocious questions: “Last time we were here I told you that you were possibly one of the most despised and hated figures in the Hispanic community. Now clearly something has changed. Donald Trump has taken that place.” Arpaio chuckled. “Eighty-two percent of Latinos have a negative opinion of Donald Trump, according to a CNN poll,” Ramos went on. “Why do you think Latinos hate you and Donald Trump so much?” “Well, first of all, I don’t like the word ‘hate,’” Arpaio replied slowly. “It has very serious connotations. Maybe disagree with me. I don’t hate you. Some people hate you. They don’t really come out and say it.” Afterward, both Ramos and Arpaio seemed surprised that, despite their profound disagreements, their conversation had been so civil. As we walked from Tent City to his rental car, Ramos said, “I thought he was going to be more aggressive.” The following day, Arpaio told me: “I’m a little disappointed he was so nice to me. ... I worry that he’s getting to like me now. He’ll ruin my reputation.” Jorge Gilberto Ramos Avalos grew up in Mexico City and arrived in the United States in 1983, at age 24, after his career as a journalist for Mexico’s Televisa network came to an abrupt end. Ramos had reported a story about Mexican psychology that doubled as a critique of Mexico’s authoritarian government, which at the time had been controlled exclusively by the center-right Institutional Revolutionary Party for more than half a century. (Its rule would last another 17 years, a streak that once provoked the Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa to call Mexico the “perfect dictatorship.”) Ramos’s footage included interviews he did with the well-known dissident intellectuals Carlos Monsiváis and Elena Poniatowska. When Televisa tried bowdlerizing the footage with a pro-government spin, he destroyed the tape and resigned, effectively blacklisting himself. Less than a year later, he sold his Volkswagen Beetle and moved to Los Angeles in hopes of restarting his career in the United States. In January 1984, he began working for a Los Angeles station, KMEX, affiliated with a Spanish-language network that would, a few years later, be rebranded as Univision. Ramos’s English was still so wobbly that he felt nervous about asking questions at press conferences, but his timing was impeccable. Two years earlier, Univision made its first national newscast out of its Miami affiliate, WLTV. Just months after Ramos moved to WLTV to host a morning show called “Mundo Latino,” the staff of the national newscast resigned en masse to protest the hiring of a famous Mexican news anchor named Jacobo Zabludovsky who was known for his close ties to the Mexican government. Ultimately, Zabludovsky went back to Mexico for “personal reasons,” leaving the network in urgent need of an evening news anchor. Ramos got the job. He was just 28 years old. Ramos’s professional ascent also coincided with the rise of Latinos as the most demographically significant minority group in the United States. According to the Pew Research Center, in 1980 there were 14.7 million Latinos in the United States. By 2013, that figure had more than tripled to 53.9 million. In 2010, Latinos passed African-Americans as the country’s single largest minority. When he began working at KMEX, Ramos recalls in his memoir, “No Borders,” the political power of Latinos “was almost nonexistent.” By 2012, however, the Latino vote had become crucial to winning presidential elections, and Univision’s influence rose with the demographic tide. When the network requested that a fourth presidential debate be held and carried exclusively on its network, in Spanish, Republican nominee Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama quickly agreed to a compromise: two town-hall-style “forums” aired in September, a month before their English-language debates. As the 2016 election approaches, Univision’s parent company, Univision Communications, wants to expand its power beyond the Spanish-language market. It has already announced that Univision will hold a Republican candidates forum with The Washington Post sometime before March. But the main instrument of its ambitions is the company’s fledgling English-language cable network and online-media startup, Fusion. A joint venture between Univision Communications and Disney/ABC that started in October 2013 — with Univision handling content and ABC handling distribution — Fusion hopes to attract a millennial audience. The network’s lead news program is “America With Jorge Ramos.” Ramos is so important to the strategy that for months after Fusion’s start, he appeared every night on both “Noticiero Univisión” (in Spanish) and “America With Jorge Ramos” (in English), as well as on Sunday’s “Al Punto” (in Spanish). He averaged 35 interviews a week in all. Since then, “America With Jorge Ramos” has scaled back to Tuesday nights, but Ramos told me that they are prepared to do more as Election Day nears. Fusion’s fate may be contingent on the network (and Ramos) being a real actor in 2016. This July, in preparation for its upcoming initial public offering, Univision Communications revealed that Fusion posted a net loss of 35 million in 2014. It has no distribution on Comcast or Time Warner Cable, which means it wasn’t available in the Phoenix hotel in which Ramos spent the night before his interview with Arpaio. Fusion makes and airs documentaries — a strategy it plans to intensify in the coming months — but right now as a news organization, it is essentially an online start-up focused on social media and making headlines. Dax Tejera, the executive producer of “America With Jorge Ramos,” says that profit is not Fusion’s top priority. “I’ve gone into meetings where my bosses have said, ‘We want Fusion and the brand to be ubiquitous with the election,’” Tejera told me at a food court in the Houston airport, as he and Ramos traveled from Phoenix back to Miami. “They’re not saying to me, ‘We want to hit this target with the ratings, this target with the revenue stream,’ which is the traditional speak in an established media organization. Ours is about awareness and brand identity and association.” The idea, he said, tapping his upper arm, was for Fusion’s fans to want to wear their viewership on their sleeve as “a badge brand.” Tejera pointed to Ramos’s April interview with the Florida senator and Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio as one of the best examples of how they are trying to drive the political conversation. Before the interview, they convened in Ramos’s office to figure out the most visceral question they could ask about gay rights. They went with: “If someone in your family or your office happens to be gay and they invite you to their wedding, would you go?” “It got all this attention,” Tejera recalled. “It was the new litmus test of 2016. Nobody had asked it, and everybody started asking it. That’s what we are always trying to do.” The interview was indicative of an effort to expand Ramos’s franchise beyond his historical role as a tribune of Latinos’ concerns and establish him as a more all-purpose newsmaker. In part, this strategy played upon Ramos’s appeal to a fan base that finds him as attractive as, say, George Clooney. It also suggested an assumption that, after the 2012 election, immigration might not continue to be the political flashpoint that it had been throughout most of Ramos’s career. Among Republican Party eminences, the conventional wisdom following Romney’s defeat was that the party’s political future turned in no small part on embracing immigration reform. President George W. Bush supported the idea of reform in the 2000 and 2004 elections, as did Senator John McCain in 2008. After McCain’s defeat that November, the Republican strategist Karl Rove argued in a Newsweek column charting a future course for the party that “an anti-Hispanic attitude is suicidal. As the party of Lincoln, Republicans have a moral obligation to make our case to Hispanics, blacks and Asian-Americans who share our values. Whether we see gains in 2010 depends on it.” Instead, the party’s gains in 2010 came thanks to the Tea Party movement, which took a hard line on immigration. During the 2012 Republican primary, Romney tacked to the right on the issue, opposing the amnesty-offering Dream Act and suggesting that immigrants “self-deport” in a January Republican debate. These statements haunted him in the general election, and after his defeat, the party went through another round of soul-searching. Writing days after the election, the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that avoiding further electoral disaster “requires but a single policy change: Border fence plus amnesty. Yes, amnesty. Use the word.” But since Trump’s rise in the polls, Republican candidates have abruptly bolted in the opposite direction. The problem, Romney told Salinas after the 2014 mid-term elections, is that “the number of Latinos that vote in the Republican primary is quite small, and so in the long period of the primary, the people trying to get the Republican nomination are going to focus on those who they think will vote in that primary process,” i.e., non-Hispanic white conservatives. So Bobby Jindal tweets that “we need to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.” Jeb Bush defends the term “anchor babies.” Marco Rubio, who once supported immigration reform, tells Fox News that he will not legalize undocumented immigrants during his presidency. And Rand Paul flees from a Dream Act supporter in Iowa, leaving half a hamburger on his plate. “I had never expected that in 2015 we would get a candidate with such an anti-immigrant position,” Ramos told me in talking about Trump. His own views on immigration have tacked in the opposite direction. In his 2000 book, “The Other Face of America,” he argued for an amnesty similar to the one Ronald Reagan ushered through Congress in 1986, legalizing the status of more than three million people who had been working the United States since before 1982 and could prove that they were not guilty of any crimes. These days, Ramos says that undocumented immigrants must not only be legalized, they must be given a pathway to citizenship. He has even suggested that the United States should consider the possibility of an open, European Union-style border with Mexico. If such positions have led to accusations that Ramos is an activist, other facts make people wonder about Univision Communications’s bias as well. Fusion’s other major news anchor is Alicia Menendez, the daughter of the New Jersey Democratic senator Robert Menendez. One of Univision Communications’s major stakeholders is the billionaire Haim Saban, a top donor to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Ramos’s daughter, Paola, accepted a position with the Clinton campaign in June. When she took the job, Ramos disclosed the event in a letter posted on the Fusion website. He told me that he and his daughter still speak to each other almost every day, but that their conversations about politics are now strictly limited. They won’t discuss anything connected to his job or hers. That’s almost everything, I pointed out. “It’s almost everything,” he agreed. What do they talk about instead? “Bah,” he sighed. “Relationships, trips, family. That’s much more important than politics.” Ramos toyed with the idea of running for a Senate seat as recently as 2002, when he mentioned the possibility in “No Borders.” His most recent political book, “A Country for All” (2010), reads like a cross between a white paper and a stump speech. But when we spoke, he insisted that he no longer has any intention of running for any office. He has decided that he can have more impact as a journalist. Was this simply politics by another means? I asked. “Well, as a journalist, I want to be relevant, no?” he said. “And I want to be a participant, a player, in the country where I’m living. And that’s what I’m doing every single day.” Over the years, he said, he has developed a philosophy about what sorts of issues a journalist can appropriately advocate for: human rights and freedom of the press, for instance, and battles against corruption and dictatorships. Partisan politics, he said, falls outside of his territory. But Ramos is unapologetic about exhorting Latinos to exercise the political power they possess as a voting bloc. In “A Country for All,” he argues that candidates can no longer expect to win the Hispanic vote “by simply saying a few words in Spanish, showing up at a press event with a politician who has a Latino surname.” Now, he says, Democrats and Republicans alike must deliver concrete benefits to Latinos. A Supreme Court justice. Immigration reform. On July 16, a month after Trump announced his candidacy, Ramos made a short speech in Spanish on Univision’s annual entertainment awards show “Premios Juventud.” “We’re going to talk about those who love us, but also about those who don’t love us,” he said. He pointed out, to huge applause, that more than four million Latinos have university degrees and more than one million have master’s or doctorate degrees; that they are not narcos, rapists or otherwise criminals. “When they attack one of us, they are attacking all of us,” he continued. “But we already know what we’re going to do. ... On Election Day, we will remember who was with us and who was against us. No, we won’t forget.” He repeated the warning in English. Ramos never named Donald Trump. He never told his audience to vote for Clinton or for Rubio. He simply said, “We will remember.” That night, “Premios Juventud” was the top-ranked program on all broadcast television among viewers aged 12 to 34, beating ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. Whatever happens in 2016, Ramos told me, he believes that candidates who openly oppose Latino immigrants will be soon become relics. Trump? “We might read about him in history books, as the last one who tried to do something like that.” Marcela Valdes is a journalist specializing in Latin American culture.

Translate this to English?","output":"This guide outlines the procedure for filing a Notice of Objection with the Tax Appeals Directorate and a Notice of Appeal with the Superior Court of Justice. Before diving into the steps, it is essential to understand what these terms and procedures mean: 1. Notice of Objection: It is issued when you disagree with your tax assessment and dispute the assessment before the Tax Appeals Directorate, a specialized division responsible for handling tax disputes. This should be filed within a stipulated time limit, usually 90 days after you receive the tax assessment. 2. Tax Appeals Directorate: This is a specialized division that deals with tax disputes between taxpayers and the tax authority. They have jurisdiction to hear cases concerning income taxes, sales tax, excise taxes, and other similar matters. 3. Notice of Appeal: If you disagree with the decision made by the Tax Appeals Directorate, you can appeal to a higher court, i.e., the Superior Court of Justice. This notice outlines the grounds for your disagreement and must be filed within a specified time, generally within 30 days of receiving the Tax Appeals Directorate's decision. With these explanations in mind, here is a step-by-step guide for filing a Notice of Objection and Notice of Appeal: Step 1: Review the tax assessment Before you begin the process of filing an objection or appeal, review the tax assessment in detail to ensure that there are discrepancies or errors that warrant filing these notices. Step 2: Gather documentation Collect all relevant documentation, including any correspondence, tax slips, receipts, invoices, or any additional material that may support your objection or appeal. Step 3: Consult a tax professional Seek professional advice from a tax consultant or attorney well versed in handling tax disputes. They can provide you with invaluable advice and guidance on how to proceed with your objection or appeal. Step 4: File a Notice of Objection Draft and submit your Notice of Objection to the Tax Appeals Directorate. Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, a detailed explanation of your reasons for objecting, and any relevant supporting documentation. It is crucial to meet the deadline for filing this notice. Step 5: Wait for a decision from the Tax Appeals Directorate The Tax Appeals Directorate will review your Notice of Objection and issue a decision. This process may take some time, depending on the complexity of the case and the volume of cases they are handling. Step 6: File a Notice of Appeal If you disagree with the Tax Appeals Directorate's decision, the next step is to file a Notice of Appeal with the Superior Court of Justice. This notice should state the grounds for your disagreement and be supported by all relevant documentation and evidence. Again, be mindful of the filing deadline. Step 7: Prepare for your court appearance Work with your tax professional or attorney to build a strong case and prepare for the court appearance. This will include organizing all documentation, crafting persuasive arguments, researching relevant case law, and being ready for any questions or objections raised by the opposing counsel. Step 8: Attend and present your case in court Make sure you arrive on time for your court hearing, dressed appropriately, and fully prepared for the proceedings. Present your case professionally and respectfully, addressing the court and opposing counsel as required. Your tax professional or attorney can provide invaluable guidance in this regard. Step 9: Await the court's decision The court will review the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and issue a decision in due course. This process may take several months, depending on the complexity of the case and the court's schedule. Step 10: Move forward based on the decision If the court rules in your favor, consider your options for the next steps, including whether you might need to negotiate a settlement or payment plan with the tax authority. If the court rules against you, consult your tax professional or attorney about any potential avenues for appeal or further dispute resolution. By diligently following these steps, you can navigate the process of filing a Notice of Objection with the Tax Appeals Directorate and a Notice of Appeal with the Superior Court of Justice. It is essential to remain aware of deadlines, consult professionals, and be well-prepared to present your case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Those who need a goal are confident and clinical, those paid to keep them out are focused and alert; and Aston Villa are in town. Theo Walcott invited ninth-month-old son Finley along to his first game and was able to mark the occasion with his first goal in the Barclays Premier League for more than a year. 'In the second half, I can't think of a more one-sided game,' said Walcott, swept up in the euphoria of a fifth successive win, and the joy of being fit. Olivier Giroud chips the ball over the on-rushing Brad Guzan to score the opening goal of the game for Arsenal. Mesut Ozil fires in the Gunners' second goal after a well-timed through ball from Giroud. Theo Walcott bends in Arsenal's third goal of the afternoon after being set up by Santi Cazorla. Santi Cazorla scores Arsenal's fourth goal from the penalty spot, Guzan got a hand to it but couldn't keep it out. Hector Bellerin guides the ball into the back of the net from distance for Arsenal's fifth and final goal. Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Ospina 7; Bellerin 7.5, Mertesacker 7, Koscielny 7, Monreal 7; Coquelin 7.5, Ramsey 7 (Flamini 77, 6.5), Walcott 7 (Rosicky 70, 6.5), Cazorla 9, Ozil 8.5; Giroud (Akpom 70, 7).

It was his first since he last played Villa, and Ozil weighed in on the baby theme with a thumb-sucking celebration dedicated to his niece. Teenager Hector Bellerin found the net, too, with his first for the club, while Olivier Giroud grabbed the opener and Santi Cazorla struck from the penalty spot, a goal which his fabulous performance deserved. There might have been more. Twice Arsenal rattled the goal frame and Ozil saw one ruled out for offside, all of which must have been very painful for Villa to witness. Paul Lambert's team have not scored in more than 10 hours, and the fact they dominated possession and missed very good chances at key moments is of little consolation. 'We scored goals and we didn't concede,' said Wenger. 'Our offensive game was good even though we had weaker periods when Aston Villa were in possession. We always looked dangerous when we got through their lines. And we were defensively sound. Overall, it was a positive day for us. 'I feel a bit for Villa. They were caught in last 20 minutes because they were tired. The second goal was a blow for them. But overall they did fight.' Arsenal have won three on the bounce in the Premier League for the first time this season, building on the victory at Manchester City. Walcott, Ozil, Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny are back after injuries, but Wenger's decisions to bring in goalkeeper David Ospina and Francis Coquelin, who has added bite in midfield, have provided stability in the team, together with what seems a tactical tweak to concede a little more possession and operate on the break. The French striker's team-mates rush over to congratulate him after his delicate finish early in the first half. Ozil put in arguably his best performance of the season as Arsenal beat Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon. Walcott celebrates scoring his first Premier League goal of the season against Aston Villa in London. Cazorla is congratulated by Chuba Akpom, who won the penalty from which the Spaniard scored. Bellerin, set up by compatriot Cazorla, celebrates scoring the final goal of the afternoon. There was no Alexis Sanchez, who was resting a tight hamstring, but, with such an array of creative talent, Arsenal will always score goals. More importantly, these three wins have been achieved without conceding once. 'We have found better consistency,' said Wenger. 'That will be important until the end. Let's show we can win more. Confidence is higher but defensive stability vital. When you don't have that you suffer. 'It's too early to say we are in the title race. We are 11 points behind. They need to lose four and we need to win four. Let's try to be consistent and see what happens.' When Ozil's ambitious heel-flick cleared Jores Okore and fell perfectly for Giroud, there was a hint it might be one of those days. Once he cleared it from under his feet, Giroud, clipped a neat finish over the dive of Brad Guzan. Cazorla thumped a low curler into a post, Ozil was denied by a flag and Guzan saved from Ramsey. Villa steadied but were cautious. Even on the turnover of possession, they appeared reluctant to commit anyone in support of the ball-carrier, often leaving it to the front three, who were overwhelmed. Even so, three minutes before half-time, the visitors should have been level and would have been were it not for a fabulous save from Ospina. Villa's players look dejected after a torrid afternoon in north London that saw them concede five goals. Giroud celebrates after scoring his eighth goal of the season for the Gunners after just eight minutes of the first half. Andreas Weimann beat Bellerin in the air to meet a cross at close range but Ospina sprang to his left to keep it out. He made another fine save in stoppage time to deny Ashley Westwood, but Weimann’s header was the big chance. Score and it might change the rhythm of the game, panic Arsenal, but it was saved and within seconds Kieran Richardson was lunging into a last-ditch tackle to avert another dangerous breakaway from Walcott. Christian Benteke missed the target as Villa came out for the second half with more adventure, which only made it easier for Arsenal to rip them apart on the counter-attack. Since his players were wasteful in possession, it is easy to understand why Lambert operates with caution. Giroud supplied Ozil for the second, who took it on at pace and applied a precision finish, and Walcott made it three, cutting in from the left, trading passes with Cazorla and swerving his shot inside the post. Giroud headed against the bar before he was replaced by Chuba Akpom, who soon won a penalty, tumbling over Guzan after beating the keeper to a though ball. Guzan read Cazorla’s plan to smash it down the centre and stood firm but was only able to deflect the powerful strike into the net with his left-hand. Bellerin slid in the fifth, a beautifully accurate side-footed finish from the edge of the penalty box. It was one of those days. Aston Villa: therapy for the goalless. If only they could play against themselves. Arsenal substitute Akpom is taken out by goalkeeper Guzan for the penalty in the second half. World Cup-winner Ozil, who assisted the first goal and scored the second, had a goal disallowed for offside in the first half. American goalkeeper Guzan kicks the post in frustration after failing to save Cazorla's penalty. Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker clears the ball under pressure from Villa's Belgian striker Christian Benteke. Benteke, who scored twice in this fixture last season, controls the ball while Laurent Koscielny flies past.

There was a clear, unspoken weight to her proclamation, something that transcended the physical concept of being lost. For a moment, her features softened. It was a fleeting expression, but it allowed me a glimpse into the turmoil that was likely causing her to bristle with such intensity. \\"Not in the literal sense,\\" she responded, crossing her arms over her chest defensively. \\"I think you're lost in a sea of misunderstandings, misconceptions.\\" As she spoke, it was as if the world around us came to a halt. The background noise of our acquaintances became a distant echo, the melodic notes of the playing song turned into a droned hum, and all that mattered in that moment was Mia, her glowering pair of unsettlingly penetrating gaze, and her words that were as sharp as icicles yet held a strange, unanticipated warmth. \\"In what is going on here,\\" She gestured vaguely between her and me, and beyond, likely indicating AJ who was standing a few disoriented steps away. \\"In your assumptions about AJ and me. In the picture you have painted inside your head about our relationships, alignments, and emotions. You're lost, and your misguided notions are steering you further away from the truth.\\" Bitter bile rose in my throat at the accusatory tone, a stinging slap of words that whipped through my calm façade. I felt a sweeping energy that was as riveting as it was shocking. It jolted me to the core, shaking the presumptions I held, twisting my way of thinking to a halt and compelling me to look from a perspective I had disregarded in my complacency. There were questions bubbling at the back of my mind, a scrambling need for clarification, for accusation, maybe also for denial. Yet, as I looked at Mia again, I saw not just the iron-hard conviction gleaming in her eyes, but also an underlying plea for understanding that arrested the words on the tip of my tongue. In that moment, I understood that there was so much more behind her aggression, so much she wanted to but could not say. This exchange, intense and probing as it was, opened a chasm of realizations, forcing me to acknowledge that maybe I was indeed lost. Not geographically or in a physical sense, but lost in reading between the lines, lost in understanding their complex dynamics, lost in my own preconceived notions, and most importantly, lost in comprehending emotions that ran far deeper than my shallow interpretations.    As gravity of her words started to sink in, I felt a quiet resolution stirring within me. A resolution to find my way through this intricate labyrinth of hidden emotions and unsaid words, to understanding them better, and to perhaps finding myself in the process. Because being lost is but a prelude to being found, and this unexpected confrontation with Mia marked nothing but the beginning of that journey for me."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The new university hospital in Trenton, which the Health Minister Victoria Culley has described as a \\"shining example\\" to hospitals all over the country, has been open now for over six months. Having heard several complimentary   comments about the organization and efficiency of the place, I decided to see for myself. In spite of arriving early, I found that there were already long queues at the reception desks. While I was waiting, I looked around and had to admit that it is an impressive building: large and light with marble everywhere. Eventually my turn came and I presented my doctor's letters to the receptionist, who informed me that I was in the X-ray queue and I'd have to go to another queue and start again! I couldn't believe it and asked her if it might be possible to give me an appointment card anyway without making me queue up again. She informed me it was no good arguing with her and I should have read the sign, an almost invisible piece of card saying \\"X-rays\\" just in front of her where very few people can have seen it. No matter how hard I tried to persuade her, she wouldn't give me an appointment card for a blood test, so I started queuing again and finally got the card at 8: 30! I then set off for the blood test room, following the nice new signs until they suddenly stopped and I realized that I was in a part of the hospital that hasn't been finished yet! When I got to the door I saw a notice saying \\"Back in 10 minutes\\". I sat down and waited for 30 minutes before a doctor appeared and told me to come in without, of course, apologizing for keeping me waiting. I asked him why I'd had to wait and he explained he'd had to help out in another ward which was understaffed as a result of a flu epidemic   among the doctors! I got out of the hospital at 9:45 a.m. and breathed a sigh of relief. I'm now waiting for the results. So, Mrs. Culley, a far from rosy picture.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  Erschallet, ihr Lieder is the third of the Weimar cantatas. It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His  temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\"....  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person whose text shows elements of early Pietism?

Given the question: Given the following passage  \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you're feeling inadequate or immature, it probably stems from not finding and pursuing your true talents. Part of becoming an adult, in this sense, is reaching a degree of independence. Start by trying several jobs or activities to find what you're naturally skilled at. For example, you might volunteer at a hospital and discover that you're great at working with people or handling difficult situations. This might lead you to pursue a career that's people-oriented. Studies suggests that the people who are happiest with their lives find their natural talents and pursue them. This is more important than choosing a career based on popularity or income. Since no two people ever follow the exact same life path, your own development as a person will be unique. This can be difficult to appreciate since people live in communities and societies that often have expectations and age-related milestones. For example, your society might expect you to get an education, find a job, and start a family, in that order. Or, you might be expected to care for a family member instead of starting off on your own. It can be hard to know what to do when social expectations conflict with what you'd like to do with your life. Remember that research suggests that those who are happiest with their lives aren’t necessarily those who chose their career path based upon its prestige. Find which activities, people, or things make you act with the most enthusiasm and passion. This will help you feel more independent and competent in your daily life. Avoid simply acting on an impulse. Instead, give some thought to what you're already motivated by and learn to use these abilities. For example, you may realize that you're passionate about teaching others. Use this knowledge to look for opportunities to use that enthusiasm. You may tutor classmates, teach in a school, or go to school to become an educator. Start by making a list of as many happy situations you can remember. Write down as many details regarding the events as you can remember. A list will help you figure out what it was about these situations that made you happy or energetic. You may notice that you were with the same few people. Or, maybe you found that you enjoy figuring out challenges. Since different things make different people happy, it's important that you know what you enjoy. For example, your list might have something like playing video games, playing the drums, or painting. This might lead you to realize that you're happiest when you're working with your hands. This is especially true if you're a young adult, relying on your parents to support you. Take steps to take care of yourself and your needs. This might mean getting a job to support yourself financially. Or, if you notice you're lonely, schedule time with friends to get some company.  Avoid relying on others to take care of you and look after your needs. Part of growing up is recognizing that you are the one that's responsible for you. Once you're supporting yourself, it will become easier to make your own decisions and stand by them. While you're growing up, others often make all your decisions for you, be they major or minor ones. Part of becoming your own person is moving to make your own choices. You might start with smaller choices, like which classes to sign up for in school or where you want to eat. Gradually, start making larger life decisions for yourself. For example, if you're unhappy in your job, you can decide to quit or change careers. Or, if you're tired of living with your parents or a roommate, you can decide to move out on your own. Summary:","output":"Feeling inadequate or immature may stem from not discovering and pursuing your true talents and interests. To overcome this, explore different activities, jobs, and hobbies to find what excites you. Determine your natural skills and pursue them to achieve personal growth and satisfaction. Don't just follow social expectations or make decisions based on prestige – instead, focus on what makes you genuinely happy and enthusiastic. Make a list of happy events and analyze them to understand your preferences and passions. Learn to be self-reliant, both emotionally and financially, and gradually start making your own decisions in life. It's important to remember that growth and self-discovery are unique processes for each individual, so focus on your personal journey and embrace your own path to adulthood."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

One exciting possibility is to connect your guitar directly to your computer, which allows you to record and experiment with your sound using various software tools. In this article, we will guide you through the process of connecting your guitar to your computer, from identifying the correct audio-in port to testing the signal for the optimal recording experience.  Step 1: Locate Your Computer's Audio-In Port Before you begin, it's essential to find the right port on your computer to connect your guitar. Many computers, especially laptops, feature a combination audio-in and audio-out port, typically designated by a headphone or microphone icon. Desktop computers usually have separate audio-in and audio-out ports, with the audio-in port indicated by a blue circle. Ensure that you locate the audio-in port on your computer, as this is where you will need to connect your guitar. Step 2: Purchase the Correct Cable or Adapter Next, you will need the right cable or adapter to connect your guitar to your computer. Most electric guitars use a 1/4-inch (6.3 mm) audio jack, whereas the standard audio-in port on most computers is a 3.5 mm port. Therefore, you will need either a 1/4-inch to 3.5 mm adapter or a cable with a 1/4-inch connector on one end and a 3.5 mm connector on the other. These cables and adapters can be easily found at most music or electronics stores. Step 3: Plug Your Guitar into Your Computer Once you have the correct cable or adapter, you are ready to connect your guitar to your computer. Start by connecting the 1/4-inch connector to your guitar's output jack. Next, plug the 3.5 mm connector into your computer's audio-in port. Make sure both connections are secure and that your guitar's volume is turned up. Step 4: Test the Signal Before you jump into recording or playing through your computer, it's critical to test the signal to ensure that the connection is working correctly. To test the signal, you can use various audio recording software available, such as Audacity, GarageBand, or Pro Tools. Open your preferred recording software and ensure that the input source is set to your computer's audio-in port. Begin recording and play a few chords or notes on your guitar. If the signal is coming through clearly and without any distortion, you are ready to start recording and experimenting with your sound. Conclusion Connecting your guitar to your computer opens up a world of possibilities for creating and recording music. With just a few easy steps, you can have your guitar connected to your computer and ready to use with your favorite audio recording software. Remember to locate the correct audio-in port, purchase the proper cable or adapter, securely plug your guitar into the computer, and test the signal for the best possible recording experience.

Context: Of course, the most unforgettable classmate I had was also the most vicious bully. I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

Process:  - Food enters the body - Food begins to be processed by the digestive system - The pancreas releases enzymes to aid digestion - Digested food affects the amount of sugar in the blood - The pancreas releases one hormone to lower the blood sugar (glucose) level - The pancreas releases another hormone to raisethe blood sugar (glucose) level.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less acid rain falls happens, how will it affect the pancreas working HARDER.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the supposed perturbation of less acid rain falling does not have a direct or indirect effect on the functioning of the pancreas or the process of digestion and blood sugar regulation. Acid rain is a result of air pollution, where sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, and then mix with water vapor to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). These acidic substances then fall back to the Earth's surface as precipitation, such as rain, snow or fog, causing an increased acidity of the environment. The pancreas is an organ in the human body that plays a crucial role in the digestive process and blood sugar regulation. It secretes digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, amylase, and lipase, which break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, respectively. Additionally, the pancreas releases hormones, like insulin and glucagon, to regulate glucose levels in the blood. The process of digestion and blood sugar regulation remains unaffected by the perturbation of less acid rain. The reduced amount of acid rain will have no direct impact on the pancreas or its functioning. Instead, such reductions in acid rain can lead to benefits for the environment, including healthier ecosystems, water sources, and improved air quality. However, it is worth noting that improvements in air quality could potentially have a positive effect on overall human health, including respiratory and cardiovascular systems, but these effects would be generalized and not specific to the pancreas or the processes related to it. Thus, the pancreas working harder is not a consequence of less acid rain falling, and the perturbation does not have an impact on the digestive system process or blood sugar regulation."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

While traveling to their launch site, the men (Bobby in particular) are condescending towards the locals, who are unimpressed by the \\"city boys\\". Traveling in pairs, the foursome's two canoes are briefly separated. The occupants of one canoe (Bobby and Ed), land briefly and encounter a pair of local men emerging from the woods, one carrying a shotgun. Ed and Bobby end up in a verbal altercation with the locals before being told they cannot leave and forced into the woods with a shotgun. Ed is tied to a tree and cut with a knife while Bobby is forced to strip at gunpoint. One of the mountain men then attacks Bobby, molesting and humiliating him, when Bobby attempts to stop the assault he has his ear twisted and is ordered to \\"squeal like a pig\\", Bobby is forced to his hands and knees over a log before being brutally raped. Ed, who remained tied to a tree, is then approached by the mountain men who intend to sexually assault him. Hearing the commotion, Lewis sneaks up and kills the rapist with an arrow from his recurve bow; meanwhile, the other man quickly escapes into the woods. After a brief but hotheaded debate between Lewis and Drew about whether to inform the authorities, the men vote to side with Lewis' recommendation to bury the dead man's body and continue on as if nothing had happened â since Lewis tells them that they will be arrested and that they wouldn't receive a fair trial, as the local jury would be composed of the dead man's friends and relatives; likewise, Bobby doesn't want what had happened to him to be...

Bolstered by Trump’s appointment of two conservative justices, the nine-member court could soon begin to pare back abortion rights, starting with a major case from Louisiana that is one of several similar pending appeals. The addition of Trump appointees Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch could alter the conservative-majority court’s approach to abortion. Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who backed abortion rights in key rulings in 1992 and 2016. Jennifer Popik, director of federal legislation for the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee, said her group hopes Kavanaugh and Gorsuch will “interpret the Constitution more narrowly” on abortion rights. In Congress, legislation backed by Trump’s fellow Republicans already has been introduced to restrict late-term abortions along the lines discussed by Trump, but there are not enough votes to pass it given Democratic opposition. Abortion is one of the most contentious issues in U.S. politics. Trump, whose abortion views have been fluid over the years, has emerged as an advocate of more restrictions, a position that appeals to his conservative voter base. His address on Tuesday night in some ways kicked off his 2020 re-election campaign. His call for new limits on late-term abortions was welcomed by anti-abortion activists. When he ran for president in 2016, Trump said he would appoint anti-abortion judges who would vote to overturn the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade that recognized a woman’s constitutional right to abortion and legalized the procedure nationwide. In his State of the Union address, Trump criticized a New York law and legislation in Virginia that would in limited circumstances allow for late-term abortions when the mother’s health is endangered. “To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb,” Trump said during the speech, without specifying details. A White House spokeswoman said Trump backs legislation pending in Congress that would ban abortions after 20 weeks. Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which backs abortion rights, called Trump’s comments “smoke and mirrors.”   “This is really just a distraction. The goal is not to end a certain class of abortion. His goal is to end all abortions,” Dalven added. There is no nationwide law setting a specific limit on when in a pregnancy abortions can be performed. Each state has its own laws, with conservative states imposing restrictions and liberal states more broadly backing abortion rights. Republicans have embraced the federal legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks. But past bills have failed to overcome Democratic opposition, even when Republicans controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate. With the House now led by Democrats and the Senate by Republicans, there is even less chance of such legislation passing, though Republicans said on Wednesday they would press for a vote. As of the end of last year, 17 states had laws banning abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion rights. No states categorically ban all late-term abortions in all circumstances and 43 states have laws that impose at least some restrictions, it said. The Roe v. Wade ruling, reaffirmed by the high court in 1992, concluded that abortion could not be banned before the fetus is viable, but gave states leeway to impose greater restrictions on it toward the end of a pregnancy. In 2007, the court upheld a federal restriction on “partial-birth abortions” that involve a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it. In its most recent major abortion ruling, the Supreme Court - with Kennedy joining the court’s four liberals in the majority - in 2016 struck down regulations in Texas that abortion rights advocates said would shutter many clinics. The Louisiana case pending before the justices resembles the Texas case. It involves a requirement that doctors who perform abortions have a difficult-to-obtain arrangement called “admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. The provision was challenged by abortion rights advocates. If the court rejects their request, it would represent a shift away from the 2016 ruling following Kennedy’s retirement. The court will also decide soon whether to hear Indiana’s bid to revive a state ban on abortions performed due to the sex or race of the fetus or evidence of disability. Indiana this week asked the Supreme Court to hear another abortion case concerning a law to require fetal ultrasounds before abortions take place.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that is Jamil El Shehab's countryman?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  A beautiful English socialite, Diana Standing, and her wealthy fiancé Gerald Hume arrive at the train station in Cairo, Egypt, where they plan to be married. Although her mother was Egyptian, Diana considers herself part of the British upper class. At the station, she is noticed by Jamil El Shehab, a handsome good-natured Egyptian dragoman who enjoys romancing women tourists and freeing them from some of their jewelry. Jamil is immediately captivated by Diana and soon talks his way into becoming her official guide and driver in Egypt. While touring the Pyramids, Jamil manages to be alone with Diana and romances her with love songs. Meanwhile, Diana is also being wooed by Pasha Achmed, her fiancé's unscrupulous Egyptian business associate. In order to arrange to be alone with Diana, Pasha persuades Gerald to leave Cairo and inspect the aqueduct they are building together. When Jamil learns of the deception, he blackmails his countryman to remain silent. Later Jamil uses his position as a servant to enter Diana's hotel bedroom, and kisses her in a moment of passion. Although she briefly returns his kiss, Diana angrily fires him. Soon after, she and Gerald set out on a caravan across the desert with a new guide. Undaunted by Diana's rejection, Jamil follows and soon replaces the new guide. That night, Jamil's romantic singing has its effect on Diana, who is drawn into his arms again. When she realizes what is happening, she is outraged and strikes Jamil with a whip. On their way back to Cairo, however, Jamil sends the rest of the caravan on one route and tricks Diana into riding to Pasha's oasis retreat, where she is treated like royalty. When Pasha arrives, Jamil lies to him, telling him that Diana paid him to bring her to Pasha. When Pasha forces himself on her, she cries out for Jamil to save her, which he does, and the two ride off together in the night. Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, the full name of the person that is Jamil El Shehab's countryman is Pasha Achmed. The context mentions that Pasha Achmed is an Egyptian business associate of Diana's fiancé, Gerald Hume. Since Jamil El Shehab is also Egyptian, this makes Pasha Achmed his countryman."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Capt William Lennox [Josh Duhamel] is contacting his wife and seeing his baby girl again, when a helicopter previously thought to have been shot down over Afghanistan comes up on the radar. It lands at the base, and the base commander orders it to stand down; but, instead, it transforms into the Decepticon Blackout and attacks the base. Blackout also lets out some kind of jamming field that blocks all communication channels. He blasts his way through the base, only momentarily dazzled by flares shot at his face (which saves Tech Sgt Robert Epps [Tyrese Gibson], after Epps got scans of Blackout). Blackout locates the base's mainframe and downloads information until the humans cut the computer's hardline, terminating the network's connection.

Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann's White House bid has been thrown into doubt after a staff exodus, including her pollster and senior adviser, has led to questions about her campaign finances. Pollster Ed Goeas plans to leave the campaign after upcoming debates in New Hampshire and Nevada, and senior adviser Andy Parrish is returning to the Minnesota congresswoman's office where he served as chief of staff. The latest staff changes follow four previous resignations from Mrs Bachmann's campaign team. She is now trailing in seventh place in a new opinion poll of public support for Republican presidential candidates. Fall in support: Minnesota congresswoman Michelle Bachman, pictured campaigning in Virginia last week, has dropped to seventh place in a new poll of Republican presidential candidates. Maybe even more than the Republicans, President Barack Obama is looking forward to the GOP picking a candidate to challenge him. For now and months to come, Mr Obama is an incumbent with no specific rival, a campaigner against various forces but not one in particular. He is running against a staggering economy. And Congress. And himself - that history-making version of Mr Obama that many voters remember from 2008. The longer it takes for Republicans to rally around a nominee, the more the election remains a referendum on Mr Obama and jobs. That's not what the White House and his campaign eagerly want - a clear choice between the president and another candidate who holds starkly different views about how to improve the economy. With polls showing his approval rating in the low 40s, Mr Obama even contended yesterday that he's the underdog. 'I don't mind - I'm used to being an underdog,' the president said in an interview with ABC News. With no control over when he gets an opponent, Mr Obama is now waging what amounts to a proxy campaign against the eventual Republican nominee. Every time he presents his jobs bill as a choice between helping the middle-class or protecting the ultra-rich, every time he tells Democratic donors that his opponents' approach to governing 'will fundamentally cripple America', he is previewing a campaign argument that he will apply against whoever his opponent is. Republican insiders say their party's battle could extend into May - meaning Mr Obama would not have a specific challenger for more than seven months. Alice Stewart, a Bachmann spokeswoman,. said: 'Given the changing caucus and primary schedule, we will not be. utilising full-time polling consultants and will concentrate heavily on. retail politics in Iowa. 'Ed will work on several projects with us this month, then we shift focus to Iowa and he will shift to other projects not associated with the campaign.' Mr Parrish's return to Minnesota follows a move to Iowa last summer to build support before the state's lead-off 2012 caucuses. The moves signal an effort to preserve money three months ahead of the first Republican nominating contests. Mrs Bachmann began July with about 3.6million (£2.3million), most of which had been transferred from her congressional campaign account. She has struggled to match her vast reach among small-dollar givers with cheques near the 2,500 maximum donation. An update on her campaign's financial health is due by October 15. In other staff changes, deputy press. secretary Doug Sachtleben transferred back to the congressional office. after only a couple months with the campaign. So has Mrs Bachmann's. scheduler, Kimberley Rubin. In. a statement released last night, Ms Stewart said the moves were part of. a long-standing strategy to 'shift people and resources as needed'. She. said: 'We are adding staff in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to. meet the demands of the changing caucus and primary schedule. 'With Congress back in session, we have shifted some employees back to the congressional office to meet the demands there.' Only last month, Mrs Bachmann's campaign manager Ed Rollins and his deputy stepped down. Mr. Rollins cited health reasons and deputy David Polyansky attributed his. departure to differences over the campaign's direction. Their exit came. within weeks of the candidate's Iowa GOP straw poll victory. After a strong start, numerous gaffes that earned her comparisons with that other hard-right conservative, Sarah Palin, Mrs Bachmann's standing in the race is starting to suffer. She now stands as the seventh most popular Republican candidate. A fall in support was first noticeable when Texas Governor Rick Perry announced his candidacy. She. fell further in opinion polls after suggesting an unproven link between. vaccines and mental retardation while trying to criticise Governor. Perry's executive order requiring young girls to get immunised for the. human papillomavirus, a sexually spread virus that can cause cervical. cancer. Former Massachusetts governor.

Republican presidential candidates (from left to right): Mr Romney, Mrs Bachmann, businessman Herman Cain and former U.S. ambassador to China Jon Huntsman line-up in Florida last month. A favourite among Tea Party supporters and evangelical voters, Mrs Bachmann is now betting her campaign on Iowa.

The list of numbers provided in the input meets the criteria because it is a list containing different numeric values, both positive and negative. Part #2: Subtract every value in the list with the index it is at Usage: Start with the first number 7, whose index is 1. Subtract the index from the number: 7 - 1 = 6. Move on to the next number 20, whose index is 2. Subtract the index from the number: 20 - 2 = 18. And so on for every element in the list. Part #3: The index of an element starts at 1 Usage: In the example list [7, 20, -10, -12, -14, -8], the index of the first element (7) is 1. This meets the criteria as specified in the definition. Part #4: Increment the index by 1 for each element Usage: As we progress through the example list [7, 20, -10, -12, -14, -8], the index of each element increments by 1, so [index of 7 = 1, index of 20 = 2, index of -10 = 3, index of -12 = 4, index of -14 = 5, index of -8 = 6].

Most prefers messages to e-mail, seldom makes online shopping at all. Although they are now depending on the Internet more often than before to communicate with others who have the same professions, hobbies and political interests, online shopping still remains unpopular in China. Three-quarters of users surveyed have never bought anything over the Internet, and only 10 percent do shopping even once a month. Among those who do buy online, most pay for entertainment while others buy phone cards, or computer hardware or software. \\"Many people don't trust the quality of goods bought online,\\" the researcher said, \\"If they buy it in a store and don't like it, they can easily bring it back.\\" The survey was done in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Changsha.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sasha said they would send information over but forgot to send it.  Given the context: How would Sasha feel afterwards? Answer:","output":"Sasha would likely experience a mix of emotions after forgetting to send the important information. Here's a detailed analysis of the emotions Sasha might experience and the possible thoughts that could accompany those emotions: 1. Guilt: Since Sasha had promised to send the information and failed to do so, a sense of guilt might be the most overpowering emotion. They might worry that their forgetfulness has caused inconvenience for the person who was expecting the information. Thoughts such as, \\"I should have double-checked whether I sent it,\\" or \\"I can't believe I forgot something so important,\\" may occupy Sasha's mind. 2. Anxiety: Alongside guilt, Sasha could also feel anxious about the implications of not sending the information on time. They may worry about potential consequences, especially if the information was time-sensitive or critical for a task or decision-making process. Sasha may have thoughts like, \\"What will they think of me?\\" or \\"Will my forgetfulness cause any problems for them?\\" 3. Embarrassment: Forgetting to send important information can be an embarrassing experience. Sasha may feel self-conscious and worry that others will see them as forgetful or unreliable. Worries such as, \\"This makes me look unprofessional\\" or \\"I hope they don't think I'm incompetent,\\" may contribute to their embarrassment. 4. Frustration: Sasha may feel frustrated with themselves for forgetting something important. They could have thoughts like, \\"Why didn't I set a reminder for myself?\\" or \\"I need to find a better way to keep track of my tasks so this doesn't happen again.\\" 5. Urgency: Upon realizing their mistake, Sasha would likely feel a sense of urgency to correct it as quickly as possible. They may immediately get in touch with the recipient to apologize and attempt to make amends by sending the information right away, thinking \\"I need to fix this now\\" or \\"I'm going to send this and explain what happened.\\" 6. Remorse: Following the barrage of emotions, Sasha may experience remorse for forgetting to send the information, hoping that their mistake doesn't affect anyone negatively. They could think, \\"I hope my forgetfulness doesn't hurt our relationship or harm their work in any way.\\" All of these emotions and thoughts may blend together, making Sasha feel a complex mix of guilt, anxiety, embarrassment, frustration, urgency, and remorse. The intensity of these emotions might depend on factors such as how important the information was, how much the recipient relied on it, and the time elapsed since the information was expected. To alleviate these feelings, Sasha would likely take action to rectify the situation and may put preventative measures in place to avoid future forgetfulness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All charges against George Obama, half-brother to U.S. President Barack Obama, have been dropped after his arrest in a drug raid, according to police in Kenya. George Obama was arrested in Kenya on suspicion of marijuana possession, according to police. He was released on Saturday hours later, police added. Obama was arrested in a Nairobi slum, and he was picked up with people who possessed marijuana, said police spokesman Eric Kiraithe. \\"Being found with people who are in possession of cannabis is a petty offense,\\" Kiraithe said. Earlier, police had told CNN that Obama had been arrested for possessing cannabis and resisting arrest, which can carry a sentence of up to a year in jail or hefty fines. \\"Police in Kenya do not look at criminals in light of associations with relatives,\\" Kiraithe said. Obama and the president barely know each other, though they have met. George Obama was one of the few people closely related to the president who did not attend the inauguration in Washington. In his memoir, \\"Dreams from My Father,\\" Barack Obama describes meeting George as a \\"painful affair.\\" His trip to Kenya meant meeting family he had never known. CNN tracked down George Obama in August 2008 and found him at a small house in Huruma, a Nairobi slum, where he lives with his mother's extended family. His birth certificate shows he is Barack Obama's half brother. The two men share the same Kenyan father. In the memoir, Barack Obama struggles to reconcile with his father after he left him and his mother when he was a child. Barack Obama Sr. died in a car accident when George was 6 months old. And like his half brother, George hardly knew his father. George was his father's last child and had not been aware of his famous half brother until he rose to prominence in the Democratic primaries last year. Unlike his grandmother in Kogela, in western Kenya, George Obama received little attention from the media until reports about him surfaced in August 2008. The reports sprung from an Italian Vanity Fair article saying George Obama lived in a shack and was \\"earning less than a dollar a day.\\" The reports left George Obama angry. \\"I was brought up well. I live well even now,\\" he said. \\"The magazines, they have exaggerated everything. \\"I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges,\\" Obama said.

Can we draw the following conclusion? People are allowed to have child pornography in their possession and it not be a criminal offence","output":"To address this task, I will analyze the information provided and offer a justified conclusion: Step 1: Identify the issue In the given statement, the issue is the B.C. Court of Appeal striking down subsection 163(1)(4) of the criminal code, which makes possession of child pornography a criminal offense in British Columbia. Step 2: Identify the implications of the issue According to the statement, the implication of the court's decision is that children in British Columbia may be at risk as a result. Step 3: Assess the conclusion provided The conclusion suggested is: \\"People are allowed to have child pornography in their possession and it not be a criminal offence.\\" Step 4: Analyze the connection between the issue and conclusion If the B.C. Court of Appeal has indeed struck down subsection 163(1)(4) of the criminal code, it would imply that the relevant provision no longer has the force of law within British Columbia. As a result, this could mean that possession of child pornography may not be legally considered a criminal offense in that jurisdiction. Step 5: Justify the conclusion based on the analysis Based on the information provided, it does seem plausible to conclude that people might be allowed to possess child pornography without facing criminal charges, specifically in the jurisdiction of British Columbia. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based solely on the provided statement, and a more comprehensive analysis of the legal context, the B.C. Court of Appeal's decision, and any potential appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada would be necessary to confirm the accuracy and implications of this conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? We rummaged through the desk for papers.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"We rummaged through the desk for papers.\\" is linguistically acceptable. The sentence structure is grammatically correct, and it has a clear meaning. Let us examine the sentence in detail to understand why it is acceptable. 1. The sentence is a simple declarative sentence in the active voice, which means that the subject of the sentence (the person or thing performing the action) comes before the verb (the action). 2. The subject of the sentence is \\"we,\\" which is a plural pronoun used to refer to the speaker and one or more other people. This pronoun can serve as a subject in a variety of situations, making it a flexible choice. 3. The verb in the sentence is \\"rummaged,\\" which means to search through something hurriedly. This verb is conjugated in the simple past tense, indicating that the action happened at some time before the present. In this case, the speaker is talking about a past event in which they, along with others, searched through a desk for papers. 4. The prepositional phrase \\"through the desk\\" indicates the location where the action in the sentence takes place—inside the desk. This phrase functions as an adverbial phrase, modifying the verb \\"rummaged\\" by providing more information about where the action happened. 5. The prepositional phrase \\"for papers\\" specifies the purpose of the rummaging action. The word \\"for\\" introduces the reason or goal of the action, while \\"papers\\" are the objects being sought. Thus, the purpose of rummaging was to find papers, and this phrase acts as another adverbial phrase in the sentence, providing additional information to the verb. Overall, the sentence is linguistically acceptable because: - It has a clear subject performing the action (we). - The verb is conjugated correctly in the simple past tense, indicating a past action (rummaged). - The sentence includes two adverbial phrases, specifying where (through the desk) and why (for papers) the action occurred. - The sentence structure and word order are correct and typical of standard English usage. In conclusion, the sentence \\"We rummaged through the desk for papers.\\" is linguistically acceptable and presents a clear and coherent idea within the context of the English language."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

We found out that very lucrative jobs were in jeopardy.","output":"Yes, the given sentence is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Syntactically, this sentence is well-structured and conforms to the rules of English grammar. Let's break it down: - \\"We\\" serves as the subject of the sentence and is a pronoun referring to a group of people. - \\"found out\\" is the verb phrase, consisting of the main verb \\"found\\" in the past tense, and the particle \\"out.\\" This verb phrase indicates an action of discovering or learning something. - \\"that\\" is a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause that provides more information about what was discovered. - \\"very lucrative jobs\\" is the subject of the subordinate clause, in which \\"very\\" is an adverb modifying the adjective \\"lucrative,\\" and \\"lucrative\\" is an adjective describing the noun \\"jobs.\\" - \\"were\\" is the auxiliary verb in the past tense, indicating a state or condition. - \\"in jeopardy\\" is the predicate of the subordinate clause, with the preposition \\"in\\" and the noun \\"jeopardy\\" together forming a prepositional phrase that describes the state or condition of the \\"jobs.\\" Semantically, the sentence is coherent and conveys a clear meaning. The speaker is stating that they (along with some others) discovered or learned that certain high-paying or profitable jobs were at risk or in danger.

A few potential scenarios where the two statements might be related are as follows: 1. Scenario A: A sports event featuring the Boston Red Sox and a team with the nickname \\"Bulls\\" is taking place in Boston. In this case, a crowd could be gathering around the stadium or two buildings in the city to support their respective teams. Here, the introductory statement of \\"Go Bulls!\\" could be an expression of support for one team, while the latter statement documents the environment at the event. However, the initial statement alone does not provide enough context for this conclusion. 2. Scenario B: A group of sports enthusiasts from Boston, including supporters of the Boston Red Sox and other local teams, is gathering to watch a game featuring a team with the nickname \\"Bulls\\" in a public space surrounded by buildings with signs related to Boston companies. In this case, the statement \\"Go Bulls!\\" could indicate their support for the visiting team or a shared interest in the game. However, once again, the initial statement does not conclusively imply this scenario. 3. Scenario C: The \\"Bulls\\" could be a local Boston sports team or a company, and their supporters and employees may gather for an event or celebration. In this case, \\"Go Bulls!\\" could indicate support for this group, and the eclectic crowd and surroundings could be a result of this gathering in a Boston location. However, as previously noted, the initial statement alone does not provide sufficient information to reach this conclusion.

Far too many. This is Life, all right, but we do treat it like a rehearsal and, unhappily, we do miss so many of its best moments. We take jobs to stay alive and provide homes for our families, always making ourselves believe that this style of life is only a temporary state of affairs along the road to what we really want to do. Then, at 60 or 65, we are suddenly given a clock and several grandchildren and we look back and realize that all those years waiting for Real Life to come along were in fact real life. In America they have a saying much laughedat by the English: \\"Have a nice day.\\" They speak slowly and seriously in their shops, hotels and sandwich bars. I think it is a wonderful phrase, making us remember, in effect, to enjoy the moment: to value this very day. How often do we say to ourselves \\"I'll take up horse-riding(or golf, or sailing)as soon as I get a greater job.\\" But only to do none of those things when we do get the higher position.

Read this: By 1840, the Market Hall and Sheds, where fresh meat and produce were brought daily, became a hub of commercial activity. The slave trade also depended on the port of Charleston, where ships could be unloaded and the slaves bought and sold. The legal importation of African slaves had ended in 1808, although smuggling was significant. However, the domestic trade was booming. More than one million slaves were transported from the Upper South to the Deep South in the antebellum years, as cotton plantations were widely developed through what became known as the Black Belt. Many slaves were transported in the coastwise slave trade, with slave ships stopping at ports such as Charleston.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Make sure you find time to enjoy your teen. Even if they are making your life difficult at times, do activities together and with the family that you know everyone will enjoy. For example, set up a family game night once each month and play board games your teen enjoys. If your teen is adventurous, take them go-karting. If your teen is artistic, take a painting class together. Find common ground and have fun.  Even if the time you spend together is just walking the dog once each day, it’s still quality time with your teen you may look back on fondly. Understand that as your teenager gets older, they may want to spend more time with their friends and less with their family. Don't force them to do family activities. Plan activities that they genuinely want to do, and respect their personal boundaries. At this crucial time in their life, your teen is looking for someone to understand what they're going through. If you’re having a hard time connecting with your teen, find ways to relate to them. Put yourself in their shoes and think about what it would be like to live a day in their life. If your teen comes to you with a problem, hear them out. They generally don't need you to fix their problems for them (they'll figure that out for themselves), but they need someone who'll listen to and empathize with them.   Sometimes loneliness (or any other issue) can trouble teens and can impact their exam marks negatively. Don't immediately punish them. Instead, understand and support them so that they don't experience loneliness, isolation, or some other negative feeling from the parental side either. Don't belittle or discount your teen's problems as being unimportant or caused by hormones. Their problems and struggles seem big to them. Just as you want your teen to treat you with respect, treat them with respect as well. Be a good role model and show them what respect looks like, even when you’re fighting or disagreeing. Constantly yelling at a child can damage their emotions and cause them to feel insecure. Respect their opinions and ask for them.  Show respect by speaking calmly and listening to your teen. Increase their independence and let them know that you trust them. Give them responsibilities and let them show you that they can come through. Don't forget to praise them for what they do right. Recognize their efforts when they have done well in school, sports, social activities, chores, or family events. If they like sports or activities, sign them up and go to their events. If they are musical, pay for lessons and go to their recitals. Get them involved in the activities they enjoy and show that you support them. This shows that you care and are invested in their skills and happiness.  If they win any awards, make a big deal out of it and take the whole family out to dinner in their honor. These are easy, fun things you can do for your teen that will cement a lifelong healthy relationship between the two of you. Sometimes teenagers may want to celebrate in ways that don't include the whole family. Make sure that when you celebrate, you celebrate in the way that they choose. Your teen is looking for a place to hang out with their friends. Be a good sport by opening your own home to them. Create a space where they can hang out by themselves but you can casually walk through. Have some healthy snacks around and let them listen to their music, hang out, and play video games.  Make yourself available, too. You'll be surprised how many of their friends might need a listening ear. Having your teen’s friends over at your house means that you can casually monitor what they’re up to and make sure they’re being safe. Teens may not always want your physical affection, but they do want your love. Show your love to your teen by being there for them. Don’t just notice their academic achievement or athletic excellence, praise them for who they are as a person and for the traits they possess. Show your love through actions, too. Whether this includes going to their sports meets or packing their lunch every day, tell them these are acts of love. Not all teens want to talk with their parents, but let them know you’re willing to listen. Unconditional love and acceptance is the greatest gift you can give them, one that will not only boost their confidence to face another day, but will also steer your relationship with them in a positive direction.","output":"It's important to enjoy time with your teen and do fun activities together, even if they sometimes make life hard. Be understanding when they want to spend time with friends and listen to their problems. Don't yell at them, but instead respect their opinions and let them have some independence. Praise them for their achievements and let them have friends over at your house. Show your love for your teen by being there for them and supporting what they enjoy doing.

Help as much as you can. Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan?  Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. The answer to this question is:","output":"Under Milly's plan, the number of animals is likely to increase or at least have a better chance of stabilizing. This is because her proposal to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would help mitigate the effects of global warming on natural habitats and ecosystems.

Striking images have revealed new insights into how the kidney develops from a group of cells into a complex organ. In a time-lapse video, a mouse kidney is seen developing, with cells growing out like the branches of a tree. It is hoped the images will help scientists to understand the early stages of development in mammals. University of Edinburgh scientists took time-lapse kidney growth images. They reveal structures called nephrons branching out like a tree. These are instructed to do so by a key protein called beta-catenin. By altering the protein activity, the researchers found that they could instruct the kidney to grow differently. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute used time-lapse imaging to capture mouse kidneys growing in the laboratory on camera. They identified a key protein called beta-catenin that instructs cells to form specialised structures within the kidney. These structures - called nephrons - are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood to generate urine. Yesterday it was revealed that scientists had developed a transparent eggshell that allows the growth of an embryo to be monitored in a laboratory. While the ‘egg’ itself was artificial, the bird embryo inside is very much real - and allows the researchers a unique glimpse into how embryos develop . The method could be used to perform test drugs and techniques on embryos grown in this way, rather than performing tests on laboratory animals. The embryo featured in the video didn't hatch to grow into an adult bird, but scientists say their methods could allow embryos to be manipulated to understand how various biological processes work. Yellow areas in the video show where beta-catenin is most active, with higher concentrations instructing cells to form particular parts of the structure. The images reveal that a gradient in the activity of beta-catenin forms along the growing nephron. It is the concentration of the molecule that instructs cells to form each particular part of the structure. By changing the activity of beta-catenin in different places, the researchers learned that they could instruct cells to form the kidney in different ways. If nephrons do not work correctly, it can lead to a wide range of health problems - from abnormal water and salt loss, to dangerously high blood pressure. The findings will help scientists to grow nephrons in the lab that can be used to study how kidneys function. These pictures shows two different views of nephrons growing in the laboratory. On the left, the green and red areas highlight cells that filter waste products from the blood (shown in purple and red on the right. The blue/green section in both shows where urine is collected and taken away for excretion. Also, the use of time-lapsed imaging means that, rather than requiring different litters of mice to study different developmental stages, the same animals can be studied over time. This leads to a significant reduction in the number of animals needed for this type of research. 'This is the first time we have been able to identify the molecular signals that instruct cells exactly how to form functional nephrons,' said Dr Peter Hohenstein, of the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute. 'By using time lapse imaging, we can get detailed information about the signals that control how kidneys form at different time-points in development,' Dr Nils Lindstrom, of the University of Edinburgh, added. 'This means that we can use fewer animals and obtain much more information than normal imaging techniques.' Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. Striking time-lapse images reveal new insights into kidney development. 2. University of Edinburgh scientists capture mouse kidney growth on camera. 3. Key protein, beta-catenin, identified as crucial in instructing cells to form specialized kidney structures, nephrons. 4.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I can use this background: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  Now, I have a new situation: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Answer this question please: Which crop would be more beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B? Answer:","output":"Crop A would be more beneficial to farmers. This is because crop A is herbicide tolerant, which means it can survive the application of herbicides that would otherwise kill or harm crops. This has several advantages for farmers: 1. Improved weed management: Farmers can use herbicides to effectively control weeds without damaging crop A. This reduces competition for resources like water and nutrients, thus promoting healthy growth of the crop and potentially increasing yield. 2. Reduced use of chemicals: Herbicide tolerant crops like crop A can decrease the need for multiple applications of different herbicides. This can lower the costs and time associated with weed management and also reduce the environmental impact of chemical use in agriculture. 3. Prevention of weed resistance: Using a single, effective herbicide in combination with crop A can prevent the development of herbicide-resistant weeds, a problem that can arise due to repetitive use of multiple herbicides. 4. Simplified weed control: By being resistant to herbicides, crop A can allow for easier and more efficient weed control compared to crop B. This can save time and effort for farmers who would otherwise need to employ mechanical and/or hand weeding to manage weeds. 5. Increased crop yield: As a result of the above factors, farmers can potentially enjoy higher crop yields with crop A due to better weed management and reduced harm to the crops. This can lead to increased profits and better sustainability in agriculture. Therefore, considering the benefits of herbicide tolerance, crop A would be a more advantageous choice for farmers compared to crop B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is Speaking in St. Petersburg, Russia on 30 June 2011, the head of Russia's United Shipbuilding Corporation said his company expected to begin design work for a new carrier in 2016, with a goal of beginning construction in 2018 and having the carrier achieve initial operational capability by 2023. a good answer to this question? Choose your answer from: *yes; *no;","output":"*No.  Izvestiya is an important part of Russia's history, but it is not directly related to Russia's shipbuilding industry. Izvestiya was, in fact, a daily broadsheet newspaper in the Soviet Union. It was founded on March 13, 1917 in Petrograd, which is now St. Petersburg. The name Izvestiya means \\"delivered messages,\\" traditionally interpreted as \\"reports\\" or \\"news\\" in Russian. It was regarded as the official organ of the Soviet government for a long period of time, as it published government statements, decisions, and resolutions. The newspaper was originally established by the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in the heat of the Russian Revolution, acting as the voice of the Soviet authorities. In later years, particularly after the death of Joseph Stalin, the newspaper became known for its relatively high level of freedom of speech, compared with other newspapers of the period. It was often seen as an outlet for more liberal, reformist views during the eras of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Gorbachev. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Izvestiya has continued to operate, transitioning into a more typical daily newspaper under the ownership of various media corporations. It has gone through several periods of change in terms of its editorial line and political stance, but remains one of the longest-running daily newspapers in Russia. The announcement by the head of the United Shipbuilding Corporation about the design and construction of a new carrier is noteworthy, but different from the role Izvestiya played in Soviet and Russian society. While it's possible that such an announcement might have been reported in Izvestiya, the newspaper itself is not related to Russia's shipbuilding initiatives, but is a vital part of understanding media, politics, and history within Russia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.  Austria had two distinct climactic regions. The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought.  Which region had fewer plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss? Answer:","output":"The eastern region of Austria, with its wet climate and thriving vegetation, would have fewer plants with the ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss compared to the western region, which is exposed to drought conditions. The reason behind this difference lies in the adaptation mechanisms of plants to their surrounding environment. When plants are exposed to a particular set of conditions over an extended period of time, they develop traits and strategies that optimize their chances of survival in those specific conditions. In the eastern region of Austria, where there is an abundance of water and a consistently wet climate, plants have not needed to develop mechanisms to deal with water scarcity. Thus, they have not had the same selective pressure to evolve drought-tolerance strategies. In this region, the focus for plants may be more on competing for resources such as sunlight and nutrients, as water is not a limiting factor. On the other hand, the western region of Austria, which is exposed to drought conditions, creates an environment where water is a scarce and critical resource. In this region, plants that cannot effectively minimize water loss or withstand periods of low water availability are less likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this selective pressure results in a higher proportion of plant species that have developed adaptive strategies to cope with drought, such as the regulation of stomata and the maintenance of a hydraulic safety margin, as mentioned in the study by Tombesi et al. As a consequence, the western region of Austria, with its harsher and dryer climate, hosts a higher number of plants with the ability to come up with strategies to minimize water loss, in contrast to the eastern region where the wet climate does not impose the same selective pressure on plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"An increase in industrialization will likely lead to indirectly impacting a step of the process in recycling more aluminum cans.  Justification for the answer: - Industrialization generally comes with more production and higher consumption of goods. As a result, there could be an increase in the use of aluminum cans and foil. - More people are likely to be aware of the need for recycling as larger amounts of waste are produced in industrialized societies. Therefore, more individuals may choose to recycle. - As industrialization booms, it is possible that there will be advancements in recycling technologies and infrastructure, thus leading to more efficient collection, processing, and reprocessing of aluminum cans. These factors suggest that an increase in industrialization could lead to a higher volume of aluminum cans being recycled, but this would indirectly impact the specific steps in the recycling process. The individual steps in the recycling process wouldn't change; however, the sheer number of cans being processed might increase in response to the industrialization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Screen idol Takeshi Kaneshiro is back and this time hes showing his respect for Lupin, Raffles and all the great thieves and masked penny dreadful heroes of the turn-of-the-century in this massive steampunk blow-out directed by Shimako Sato, one of the few female directors in the big budget end of the Japanese film industry.Its 1949 and World War II never happened. Nikola Tesla has just won a Nobel Prize rather than dying in obscurity and the Japanese Empire is an undying aristocracy where the rich sip tea out of bone china, while the poor die in the gutters. K-20, the Fiend with Twenty Faces, steals from the rich and gives to himself. But now, on the eve of the marriage between society princess, Yoko Hashiba, and chief of police, Kogoro Akechi, the fiend frames simple circus acrobat Hekichi Endo (Takeshi Kaneshiro) for his crimes and the poor sap is arrested and sentenced to death. But he escapes at the last minute and assumes the guise of K-20 in order to clear his good name.Starting with a falling chandelier from PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and continuing with the Tunguska Explosion, Tesla coils, gyrocopters and all manner of pulp touchstones, this flick is constantly zooming, panning, gliding and skidding to a stop, suffused with old fashioned showmanship and skill. For sheer entertainment value its like all the Saturday morning matinees you never saw wrapped up in one film and given a big budget gloss. But more than the skill and style, the actors are a delight. The young princess, Hashiba (Takako Matsu) describes herself as just a modest girl from a good family, but really shes a two-fisted adventurer in waiting, hemmed in by good breeding but secretly yearning to sock a baddie in the jaw and fly a helicopter into the sunset. Takeshi Kaneshiro is charm itself, and its a pleasure to spend two hours in his company.

Premise: In this case, that would have been a happy result. From the given statement, the assumption is that a particular situation or outcome leads to a positive or happy result. The nature of \\"this case\\" is not specified, but we understand that it is considered to be a favorable outcome. Hypothesis: It would have been a bad result. This statement is suggesting the opposite of the premise. It proposes that the given situation or outcome leads to a negative or bad result. Now, let us examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Entailment, in logic, occurs when the truth of one statement (in this case, the premise) necessarily guarantees the truth of another statement (in this case, the hypothesis). So, if the premise were true, the hypothesis would automatically be true, too. However, in the given scenario, the premise suggests a happy or positive outcome, while the hypothesis suggests a bad or negative outcome. These two statements are contradictory in nature, and both cannot be simultaneously true. If the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be false, and vice versa. Thus, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The truth of the premise (that \\"this case\\" leads to a happy result) does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (that \\"this case\\" leads to a bad result).

Professor Anthony Hilton from Ashton University, UK, tested the rule with his students.They found that food dropped for five seconds is less likely to contain bacteria  than if it sits there for longer. For the study, Hilton and his students tested a lot of foods----bread, pasta, cookies and candy--to see how much bacteria they had when they made contact with the floor.They allowed the food to lie on the different types of flooring--carpet , laminate   and tile  -- for three seconds to 30 seconds. Not surprisingly, the longer the food was on the floor, the more bacteria it had.And the type of floor where the dropped food landed had an effect.Bacteria are least likely to transfer  from carpet, while they are most likely to transfer laminate or tiled surface after more than five seconds. The study also found that the wetter the food, the more likely it was to pick up bacteria.Although most people are happy to follow the 5-second rule, eating food dropped on the floor still carries an infection  risk.\\"It very much depends on which bacteria are on the floor at the time.\\" Hilton told Forbes.

Q:Here's a question: What country is the native home of lemurs?  Here are possible answers to this question: - india - field - belarus - russia - heaven  I believe the correct choice is \\"russia\\", here's why: A:","output":"The native home of lemurs is Madagascar, which is not on the given list of options. However, I will explain why \\"Russia\\" may not be the best choice and provide information about the native home of lemurs. Lemurs are a group of primates endemic to Madagascar. They are not originally from Russia, India, Belarus, or any other country. The island of Madagascar, located in the Indian Ocean off the southeastern coast of Africa, has a unique ecosystem and serves as the natural habitat for a diverse range of flora and fauna, most of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The reason lemurs are only found in Madagascar is due to its isolation from other landmasses for millions of years. Madagascar separated from the Indian subcontinent approximately 88 million years ago, which allowed the evolution of unique species without interference from other animals. Lemurs were able to evolve, adapt, and thrive in this isolated environment. Russia, on the other hand, is a country with a vastly different climate and geography compared to Madagascar. Its northern location, cold temperatures, and diverse environmental conditions across a large landmass do not provide suitable habitat for lemurs. The ecosystems in Russia are home to different types of animals adapted to its climate, such as bears, wolves, and foxes. India also does not have lemurs, although it shares similarities with Madagascar in terms of climate and geography. Despite the similarities, lemurs have not migrated to India or other nearby countries due to natural barriers such as the Indian Ocean. It is also important to consider that lemurs are protected species, and international efforts are being made to preserve their habitats and prevent their illegal trade. In conclusion, the native home of lemurs is Madagascar. While the correct option is not present in the given list of possible answers, it is important to understand the unique biodiversity of Madagascar and the environmental conditions that have allowed lemurs to thrive as a species in their natural habitat, distinct from the countries and choices provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A Korean wave is sweeping across China, with many Chinese women worshiping South Korean actors Kin Soo-hyun and Lee Min-ho as demigods . Chinese netizens always have different opinions. Over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China, And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star, the South Korean TV series which is on the air now. You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs   have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements  :a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs describe the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people still like Cinderella-type stories. The widening wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their hope for a better life might have caused many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV drams describe. _  Many netizens even said at an earlier time that South Korean TV dramas had become popular because of their stereotyped   themes: traffic accidents, cancer and other incurable diseases. But all that has changed with the success of You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs, which Chinese directors can use as examples, as well as inspiration, to improve their productions.

Question: Two earth-like planets orbited the same star. The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II, however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which planet did not cause the greenhouse effect?  Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the question being asked - \\"Which planet did not cause the greenhouse effect?\\" Step 2: Review the given information - Two earth-like planets orbit the same star: Earth I and Earth II. Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, while Earth II protected its environment from anthropogenic changes. Step 3: Understand the context - The hint provides information about how the greenhouse effect is caused by human-made releases of greenhouse gases and how it results in global warming. Step 4: Analyze the information - Earth I released greenhouse gases, which can cause the greenhouse effect, according to the context provided in the hint. Earth II protected its environment from human-made changes, meaning that it did not release anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Step 5: Answer the question - Based on the analysis, Earth II did not cause the greenhouse effect, as it protected its environment from anthropogenic changes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

International Skating Union (ISU) regulations describe pair teams as consisting of \\"one lady and one man.\\" The sport is distinguished from ice dancing and single skating by elements unique to pair skating, including overhead lifts, twist lifts, death spirals, and throw jumps. Pair teams also perform the elements of single skating in unison. The discipline requires similar technique and timing on all elements of the performance in order to create an impression of \\"two skating as one\\". Serious skating accidents are most common in pairs.  - Single skating is a discipline of figure skating in which male and female skaters compete individually. Men's singles and ladies' singles are both Olympic disciplines and are both governed by the International Skating Union, along with the other Olympic figure skating events, pair skating and ice dancing. Single skaters perform jumps, spins, step sequences, spirals, and other moves in the field as part of their competitive programs.  - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada.

Q:Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... What happened after the writer wrote about OpenAdvantage? - He became a knowledge worker - He became a peddler - not enough information - The founders hired him A:","output":"After the writer wrote about OpenAdvantage, the founders, Paul and Scott, invited him back to their office and offered him a job as an open source consultant. He accepted the role, transforming his career from a journalist to a knowledge worker. He gained experience in various open source technologies, community building, and working with businesses. This allowed him to contribute to the retraining of the workforce as knowledge workers, helping organizations and individuals adapt to the growing demand for skills in the knowledge economy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this context, the importance placed on the desks can be attributed to several factors, leading to the prioritization of their role in the allocation of funds within the budget. Let us explore these factors in detail to understand their significance: 1. Functionality: Desks are generally seen as the primary work-stations within an environment such as an office, school, or even at home. They provide a stable and structured platform for various tasks such as writing, typing, drawing, organizing, and other activities that require a flat surface. In other words, desks are indispensable for facilitating productivity, making them an essential component to invest in for any setting. 2. Versatile storage: Desks often come with built-in storage compartments, such as drawers and shelves, that can accommodate items like files, books, stationery, and other essential work materials. This not only makes it easier for individuals to stay organized but also helps declutter the workspace, promoting a clean and efficient working environment. 3. Ergonomics: Since people spend a significant amount of time working at their desks, the design and construction of a desk must adhere to ergonomic standards that promote health and comfort. Inadequate desk height, for instance, can result in fatigue, discomfort, and even musculoskeletal disorders over time. The budget has to accommodate desks that meet these standards, creating a healthier work environment. 4. Durability and quality: Investing in high-quality desks is crucial since desks are used daily and need to withstand the wear and tear associated with continuous usage. Desks made from durable materials can last longer, ultimately saving money in the long run by reducing the need for frequent replacements. 5. Aesthetic appeal: Desks play an important role in creating a professional and appealing workspace. Their design, style, and color can contribute to the overall aesthetics, influencing the mood and atmosphere of the place. An attractive and cohesive interior design can boost morale and promote a positive working culture. In comparison, chairs, though also an essential element in any workspace, did not receive similar budget consideration. While chairs are crucial for providing comfortable seating and promoting healthy posture, the budget limitations might have resulted in opting for more economical chair options without compromising their basic functionality. The allocation of funds might have aimed to strike a balance between quality and affordability, prioritizing desks due to their indispensable role in creating a productive workspace. In conclusion, the desks fared better in the budget because they were deemed more essential to the overall functionality and efficiency within the given environment. This prioritization can be understood by looking at the various factors that contribute to the importance of desks, such as the versatility of their use and storage, adherence to ergonomic standards, durability and quality, and aesthetic appeal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you'd like to be extra thorough, then you can add a dash of salt to the cabbage and let it sit in a bowl for 10 minutes; this will allow the salt to soak up the excess moisture in the dumplings. Ground meat is meat finely chopped by a meat grinder. The process of mincing is usually done manually. Continue mixing the cabbage and meat together until they are thoroughly blended. Pork and lamb are generally preferred for Chinese dumplings, but beef, chicken, and turkey may be used as well. In South Asia, both lamb (mutton) and goat meat are popular. Repeat the process until you've thoroughly mixed in the remaining ingredients. If you'd rather use mixing spoons instead of your hands, that will work too, but you have to be really thorough. This will help dry out the mixture a bit. While you massage the mixture, if you feel that there is not enough vegetable oil, then you should add more. Just use a spoon to scoop out 1-2 tablespoons of the mixture in the center of every wrapper. You don't have to use the exact same amount in every wrapper; just make sure you have enough to use for all 20 or so of the wrappers. You should wet the edge of each wrapper with a damp finger and then fold the sides together, crimping (pressing together) the dough with your fingers to seal the contents inside.

Does raise mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"Yes, \\"raise\\" in both sentences means to 'increase' or 'elevate' a given value. However, though the term is used to describe the same action, the context, impact, and implications of the word \\"raise\\" differ significantly in each sentence. In Sentence 1: \\"Raise the price of bread\\", the word \\"raise\\" is directed towards increasing the monetary value attached to a specific product, in this case, bread. This could be due to various factors such as a rise in production costs, increased demand, inflation, or a deliberate business decision to improve the profitability of the product. The act of raising the price of bread may result in different consequences, such as a potential decrease in sales, dissatisfied customers, or a shift in consumer preferences to alternative products. In Sentence 2: \\"Raise my salary\\", the word \\"raise\\" is focused on the increase in income earned by an individual. This could be a request from an employee to their employer for a salary review, or a reflection of a decision by the employer to increase an employee's remuneration due to factors such as performance, experience, market competitiveness, or cost of living adjustments. The implications of raising someone's salary can include increased job satisfaction, employee motivation, retention, or the individual's overall financial stability. In summary, while the word \\"raise\\" has the same fundamental meaning in both sentences, referring to an increase in value, the context, nature, and subsequent effects of these increases are markedly different. In the first sentence, it pertains to the pricing of a product, while in the second sentence, it relates to an individual's income."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Carr was born Joseph Francis Karr on October 23, 1879, at his parents' home in the Irish neighborhood on the East End of Columbus, Ohio. His father, Michael Karr, was a shoemaker who was born in Ireland in 1841 and immigrated to the United States in 1864. His mother Margaret Karr was born in New York to Irish immigrant parents. Carr had five older siblings, Bridget, James, John, Mary, and Michael, and a younger brother, Edward. In the early 20th century, college football was the dominant version of the sport, and professional teams would sometimes pay college players to play for them, often under assumed names. The practice was considered questionable ethically, resulting in taint being associated with the professional game. In order to remove the taint, and to engender peaceful relations with the college game, Carr made it one of his first goals as league president to impose a strict ban the use of college football players. Indeed, at the same meeting at which Carr was elected president, the APFA adopted a rule prohibiting teams from using players who had not completed their college course.  Carr enforced the ban with vigor. During the 1921 APFA season, two or three college players from Notre Dame played for the Green Bay Acme Packers under assumed names. The incident resulted in the players losing their amateur status and being barred from further college football participation. In January 1922, Carr responded with the severest possible action, kicking the Packers out of the APFA. A few months later, a group headed by future Hall of Famer Curly Lambeau applied for and was granted the Green Bay franchise.  The 1925 Chicago Cardinals-Milwaukee Badgers scandal followed four years later. In December 1925, four high school students played for the Milwaukee Badgers in a game against the Chicago Cardinals. Carr responded by imposing stiff penalties. The Milwaukee club was fined 500 and given 90 days within which to \\"dispose of all its club assets at which time the management must retire from the league.\\" The Cardinals were fined 1,000 for their prior knowledge of the violation, and Cardinal player Art Foltz was temporary banned from the league for live for having \\"induced the boys to play\\".  The issue arose again when Red Grange, star halfback of the University of Illinois football team, signed with the Chicago Bears. Grange played his final college game on November 21, signed with the Bears the next day, and appeared in his first professional game on November 26. Two weeks later, Ernie Nevers signed a professional football contract for 50,000. To help ease tensions and promote the professional game in the college circles, Carr established a rule prohibiting college players to sign with professional teams until after their class had graduated. These decisions gave the NFL credibility and much needed support from the colleges and universities from across the country. Who initiated the ban?","output":"Joseph Carr, as the league president at that time, initiated the ban on the use of college football players in the professional game. He made it one of his first goals to impose this strict ban to remove the taint associated with the professional game and to establish peaceful relations with the college football community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, West Wind (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of London Underground's headquarters at 55 Broadway. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including Eric Gill with the ground-level pieces provided by Epstein.  1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London.  In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in Kiev in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the Russian Revolution and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in Buckinghamshire. Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as \\"a nest of gentle artists\\"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore.

United States presidential election, 2004: By summer of 2003, Howard Dean had become the apparent front runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack with the largest campaign war chest. Dean's strength as a fund raiser was attributed mainly to his embrace of the Internet for campaigning. The majority of his donations came from individual supporters, who became known as Deanites, or, more commonly, Deaniacs. Generally regarded as a pragmatic centrist during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as a left-wing populist, denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them.

Read this article and answer this question The success of the 1981 Irish hunger strike in mobilising support and winning elections led to what was referred to by Danny Morrison (writer) as, \\"the Armalite and ballot box strategy\\" with more time and resources devoted to political activity. The perceived stalemate along with British governments hints of a compromise and secret approaches in the early 1990s led republican leaders increasingly to look for a political agreement to end the conflict, with a broadening dissociation of Sinn Féin from the IRA. Following negotiations with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and secret talks with British civil servants, the IRA ultimately called a ceasefire in 1994 on the understanding that Sinn Féin would be included in political talks for a settlement. When the British government then demanded the disarmament of the IRA before it allowed Sinn Féin into multiparty talks, the organisation called off its ceasefire in February 1996. The renewed bombings caused severe economic damage, with the 1996 Manchester bombing and the Docklands bombing causing approximately £800 million in combined damage. After the ceasefire was reinstated in July 1997, Sinn Féin was admitted into all-party talks, which produced the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The IRAs armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, caused the deaths of approximately 1,800 people. The dead included around 1,100 members of the British security forces, and about 630 civilians. The IRA itself lost 275–300 members, of an estimated 10,000 total over the 30-year period. Between 1970 and 2005, the IRA had detonated 19,000 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the United Kingdom, an average of one every 17 hours for three and a half decades, arguably making it \\"the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history\\". How many years after the IRA ultimately called a ceasefire was the Good Friday Agreement produced?","output":"The IRA called a ceasefire in 1994, and the Good Friday Agreement was produced in 1998. So, it was 4 years after the ceasefire that the Good Friday Agreement was made."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this background article the other day: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  I am facing a new situation today: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the reactants concentration would decrease, case A or case B? Answer:","output":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. Therefore, the reactants concentration would decrease in case A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.  David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number.  Which species would have lesser reproductive success, species A or species B? Answer:","output":"Species B would have lesser reproductive success. Reasoning: In the given scenario, species A has helpful traits that contribute to its survival and reproduction, while species B has harmful traits that do not provide an advantage or may even be detrimental to its survival and reproduction. According to the theory of evolution by natural selection, organisms with advantageous traits have a higher probability of survival and, thus, greater reproductive success. Over time, this leads to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous traits compared to organisms with less helpful or harmful traits. Since species A has helpful traits, it is more adapted to its environment and has a competitive advantage over species B, which has harmful traits. This results in species A having a higher reproductive success rate and ultimately increasing in population size, while species B has a lesser reproductive success rate and may decrease in population size or struggle to maintain its numbers."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Title: swivel fork doesn't do its job Review: I thought this fork had a great concept and would help my 90 yr old mother with wrist inflexibility to deliver food to her mouth--in practice tho', the swivel is a detraction since it's hard to spear food and when the fork is finally raised to the mouth (often w/much effort), it takes an extra effort to overcome the swivel to get the food into the mouth. Maybe a fixed angled fork would work better for special-utensil-needs folks. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?","output":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the swivel fork's performance and suggests that a fixed angled fork may be a better solution for individuals with special utensil needs. The main issues highlighted are the difficulty in spearing food and extra effort required to overcome the swivel functionality when delivering the food to the mouth, both of which are not meeting the intended purpose of the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Russian spring may have been postponed this year, both on and offline. Last December, after the spontaneous popular demonstrations in Moscow against the \\"results\\" of the parliamentary elections, suggested that Russia's internet hamsters might be outfoxing Vladimir Putin. But I'm afraid that this weekend's Presidential elections have reestablished the primacy of the old regime over internet activists. Indeed, even President elect Putin may now be outsmarting popular bloggers like Alexei Navalny. So much then for the transformational power of the democratic network; so much, too, for the power of digital society to rearrange power in Russia. The problem is that the Internet doesn't have transcendental powers. Technology is just technology. It can't magically invent political parties, platforms, ideologies or leaders. And it certainly can't transform the well-intentioned democratic activists on Russian social networks like Vkonkakte and Live Journal into coherent organizations that can effectively challenge Putin's leviathan state. As one of Moscow's savviest political observers emailed me yesterday about the current political situation in Russia: \\"It shows that the best defense against revolution are not tanks and security forces, but a phony compromised opposition created by the government to preempt any real opposition. \\"It also shows that the opposition that does exist is still very much a limited Moscow phenomenon. The Internet is only a medium. It can't create an appealing opposition candidate out of a bunch of clowns. It also can't create a middle class where there is none.\\" And as Alexei Navalny tweeted yesterday: \\"We overestimated ourselves. We thought the rest of the country knew what we know.\\" So why doesn't the rest of Russia know what the anti-corruption activist Navalny knows? According to Edward Shenderovich, a Moscow based venture capitalist who runs Kite Ventures, it's because Putin controls the media. Of the 140 million people who live in Russia, Shenderovich explains, only 35 million of them are on the internet. The rest rely for their information on radio, television and newspapers which are mostly managed by Putin apologists and allies. The opposition is not only mostly limited to Moscow, but it's also politically naive. Last night, in Moscow's Pushinskaya square, protestors gathered to demonstrate against the legitimacy of Putin's electoral coronation. It was a slightly disappointing turnout (around 20,000 people) and after Alexei Navalny and presidential candidate Mikail Prokhorov spoke, a rump of the crowd became embroiled with the riot police. According to Gazeta.ru, all the talk amongst the resistors was to set up a tent city along the idealistic lines of the Occupy Wall Street movement. But haven't these Russian activists been keeping up with the news from America? If the Occupy Movement in Manhattan's Zucotti Park couldn't fight Michael Bloomberg's New York City cops, then what chance does a Moscow civic protest camp have against Vladimir Putin's tens of thousands of heavily armed militiamen? Fortunately, there are some political realists who understand that the most effective way to resist Putin isn't through a directionless Occupy Movement or via absurd theatrical stunts like the FEMEN activist in Moscow who bared her breast at the Moscow polling station where Putin had just voted. \\"The opposition now has to recognize the agonizing fact that creative flash-mobs won't get rid of Putin. We need to learn stubborn, routine and -- at a first hipster glance -- useless old-school political work,\\" noted the Opposition leader Vladimir Milov yesterday. Nor will more high-tech digital technology get rid of Putin. Indeed, the regime has cynically appropriated cutting-edge technologies such as \\"transparent ballot boxes\\" to establish its honesty. Putin even installed 180,000 web cameras at Russian polling stations in a surreal attempt to prove the legitimacy of an electoral system that is anything but radically transparent. If there is to be a political spring in Russia, it may be led by the ex CEO of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once the wealthiest man in Russia and now a prisoner in a very low tech Siberian labor camp. Khodorkovksy has penned a seven point plan for the opposition which include a focus on peaceful protest, the establishment of two or three political parties, getting activists out of Moscow into the regions and establishing working pacts with moderates within Putin's regime. Khodorkovksy' realism is echoed by the venture capitalist Edward Shenderovich. Demonstrations in Russia will continue, he explained to me. But while the internet is a great \\"communications platform\\" for organizing people and collecting money, politics, Shenderovich told me, exists \\"outside\\" the online world. The focus, he insists, should be on building a clear opposition leader and platform that will challenge what he calls \\"the most corrupt society in the world.\\" \\"Putin beats the spread\\", noted Matthew Rojanksy, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program. The losers in the Presidential election, he explained, were the middle class, young people and the United States. But Rojansky left out a fourth loser from Sunday's election: the Russian internet. â€¢ Follow @ajkeen on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Keen.

A: In 1991 a mummy of a neolithic body, known as Ötzi the Iceman, was discovered by hikers on the Similaun glacier.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Ötzi the Iceman, also known as the Tyrolean Iceman, the Similaun Man, or the Hauslabjoch mummy, is a well-preserved natural mummy of a man who lived around 3,300 BCE. His remarkably intact body was discovered on September 19, 1991, in the Ötztal Alps near the border between Austria and Italy. The mummy was found by German hikers Helmut and Erika Simon, who were trekking through the mountains when they stumbled upon the extraordinary find. Ötzi's exceptional state of preservation has allowed researchers to gain an invaluable insight into the life of people during the Copper Age in Europe. It has been determined that Ötzi was approximately 45 years of age at the time of his death. He stood about 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighed around 110 pounds. Detailed examinations of Ötzi's body have revealed tattoos made from soot and other materials, which experts believe may have been used for therapeutic or religious purposes. His clothing was primarily composed of hides and furs, including a coat made from goat hide and a hat made of bearskin. His footwear was an early form of soft shoe, likely designed for walking on rough terrain. Analysis of Ötzi's tools and other belongings has provided important information about the social and technological advancements of the time. Among his possessions were a copper-headed axe, a flint dagger, a bow, and a quiver of arrows tipped with flint. He also had a birch bark container filled with tinder fungus, which could be used as an ignition source for starting fires. Extensive scientific tests, including DNA analysis, have been conducted on Ötzi's remains to learn more about his life, his health, his ancestry, and the circumstances of his death. Studies have shown that he suffered from various ailments, such as arthritis, gum disease, and tooth decay. He was also found to have whipworm, a common intestinal parasite. His cause of death has been a subject of much intrigue and debate. Initially, it was believed that Ötzi died from exposure to the elements, but later discoveries suggested that he may have been a victim of violence. In 2001, a new CT scan revealed an arrowhead lodged within his left shoulder, which had caused severe damage to the surrounding blood vessels, indicating that he had been shot from behind. Further examination revealed a deep cut on his right hand and traces of blood from at least four other individuals on his clothing and equipment, suggesting that Ötzi was involved in a violent altercation before his death. Ötzi's discovery has had a profound impact on the scientific community and the public's understanding of the lives and cultures of our ancient ancestors, offering an invaluable glimpse into their daily routines, diet, clothing, tools, and even their beliefs and practices. Today, Ötzi and his belongings are displayed at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy, where they continue to offer new and fascinating insights into the life of this enigmatic figure from over 5,000 years ago."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her.

Write some highlights for the following article: Did Oscar Pistorius have time to think before he shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year? That's the question that state prosecutor Gerrie Nel dug into Thursday with a doctor who has spent years working with the disabled athlete. \\"His intention was to shoot, whoever he came across -- if he came across anyone\\" in his home on a February night last year, Nel put to the doctor, Wayne Derman. \\"I suppose if he came across an intruder or danger, he would shoot,\\" Derman responded. And Pistorius was firing to kill, the prosecutor said. Derman, a defense witness, paused a long time before he finally responded. \\"He was aiming to neutralize the threat,\\" the doctor said. Nel let those words hang in the air for a long moment before announcing that he was done with his questions for the day. Pistorius, 27, is on trial for murder, and while he admits firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, he pleaded not guilty. He says he mistakenly thought he was defending himself from an intruder. The prosecution says the two had an argument and he deliberately murdered the model and law school graduate, who was 29. 'Two Oscars' Derman spent all day Thursday on the stand, first testifying under defense questioning that Pistorius' double amputation is key to understanding his behavior. Do not be taken in by the fact that Pistorius is one of the fastest runners in the world -- remember he is disabled, he argued. Derman ran through a long list of the difficulties that double amputees experience every day, concluding: \\"The saddest thing I have learned through my six years of working with athletes with disability is that disability never sleeps. \\"It's there when you go to sleep at night and it's there when you wake up in the morning. It affects nearly every aspect of your life,\\" he said. Pistorius' defense team seems to be trying to establish that he acted reasonably, given who he is, when he killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013. Judge Thokozile Masipa must decide whether he made a genuine mistake and, if so, whether the mistake and his response were reasonable. The South African Olympian's defense team has been exploring his psychology this week. His lawyer Kenny Oldwadge posited Thursday that there were \\"two Oscars,\\" one of whom was a global sports star and one of whom was \\"vulnerable\\" and \\"scared.\\" \\"I am stuffed without my legs on,\\" his lawyer quoted him as saying, using a slang term meaning \\"in trouble.\\" Witness reliability. Prosecutor Nel went after Derman aggressively in his cross-examination, exploring whether the shooting was an instinctive \\"fight-or-flight\\" response or the result of conscious thought. The question of whether Pistorius is found guilty of premeditated murder could hinge on the answer. Exchanges between the two got testy, with Nel trying to get the doctor to explain Pistorius' actions moment by moment on the night he killed Steenkamp. Derman said it was impossible for him to answer theoretical questions about what Pistorius might have been thinking or doing at a given instant because he, Derman, knew what had actually happened after the moment in question. Frustrated, he appealed to Judge Masipa, but she sided with Nel, firmly instructing the witness to answer his questions or say he didn't know. Nel began his cross-examination by suggesting that Derman was not a trustworthy witness because he had a responsibility to Pistorius as his doctor. Masipa rejected the objection. The prosecutor kept up the attack, demanding to know when Derman had made particular notes on Pistorius, whether the court should believe Derman or Pistorius when their evidence differed, and the meaning of the word \\"subsequent.\\" Derman grew irritated with Nel when the prosecutor responded: \\"That's not true\\" to a statement Derman gave, and he appealed to the judge that Nel was being \\"unprofessional.\\" Masipa agreed and ordered Nel to withdraw the remark. Nel, in turn, showed annoyance with Derman asking which \\"incident\\" he was referring to. \\"The killing!\\" Nel shouted back at him. Suicide risk. The defense has been exploring Pistorius' mental health for several days. On Wednesday, his lead lawyer Barry Roux said Pistorius is depressed, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and is a suicide risk, according to the doctors who spent a month evaluating his mental health. But he does not appear to have a history of abnormal aggression or psychopathic tendencies linked to \\"rage-type murders in intimate relations,\\" they found. The conclusions are a \\"slam-dunk for the defense,\\" CNN legal expert Kelly Phelps said. The psychiatric report seemed to suggest that Pistorius' version of events was plausible. \\"When Mr. Pistorius's appraisal of the situation is that he might be physically threatened, a fear response follows that might seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of a normal bodied person, but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history,\\" the doctors found. Several witnesses have testified that Pistorius tends to arm himself and go toward danger, rather than away from it, when he thinks he is under threat. At the trial's conclusion, Judge Masipa will have to decide whether Pistorius, 27, genuinely made a mistake or deliberately murdered his girlfriend. If Masipa does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to a prison term ranging from 15 years to life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know that Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to CNN analyst Phelps. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion. The trial is scheduled to continue Monday for a 38th day. Read more: Judge sends Pistorius for psychiatric tests.

Given the question: Background: The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions.  Paragraph: Stef is a young girl interested in the geography of the world. For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is. She is specifically looking at Norway, a country near the North Pole, and Mexico, a country close to the equator.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will Norway be less accurately represented on the globe or the map? The answer is:","output":"Norway will be less accurately represented on the map (Mercator projection), because it is a country near the North Pole, and the Mercator projection tends to stretch landmasses out of shape and distort their size more significantly as they get further away from the equator. The globe presents a more accurate representation of countries' shapes and sizes, so Norway will be better represented on the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who invites Chris and Dan to a party? Movie plot title: The Brotherhood Movie plot: A young American man arrives in Palermo by plane. A taxi driver at the airport immediately gets word to Frank Ginetta (Kirk Douglas), who hides, armed with a gun, until he realizes that the visitor he's been warned about is actually his kid brother, Vinnie (Alex Cord). Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that \\"they're going to send someone,\\" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others. They, not being of Sicilian origin, are trying to leave behind the old traditional methods, such as when two of Frank's hit men kill a stool pigeon in the marshes and leave him tied to a chair with a canary stuffed in his mouth â as a warning to others who might talk too much. Frank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit. Vinnie is more of a businessman, and takes sides with the other board members in ventures they intend to pursue without his brother. Frank resents this, striking Vinnie for defying him and insisting to the board that Vinnie will have no part in what they have planned.

Condemned prisoners sing \\"Hoist the Colours\\" to compel the nine Pirate Lords to convene at Shipwreck Cove to hold the Brethren Court. Because Captain Jack Sparrow, one of the Pirate Lords, never named a successor, before being killed, Captain Barbossa, along with Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Tia Dalma, and the crew of the Black Pearl, plot to rescue Jack from Davy Jones's Locker. Travelling to Singapore, the crew meet Captain Sao Feng who owns navigational charts to the Locker and quickly gains an unpredictable interest in Elizabeth. Beckett's soldiers invade, but the crew escape. Feng and Turner make a deal to give Jack to Feng, so he in turn can use the Pearl to rescue his father Bootstrap Bill from the Flying Dutchman.

They learn the Dutchman must have a captain. Returning to the living world, the Pearl is attacked by Sao Feng and Beckett's men.

Question: What did Lector find at the ruins of the lodge to help him hunt Misha's killers? Title: Hannibal Rising Movie plot: In 1941, an eight-year-old Hannibal Lecter lives in Lecter Castle in Lithuania. Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union turns the Baltic region into part of the bloodiest front line of World War II. Lecter, his younger sister Mischa, and their parents travel to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. After three years, the Nazis are finally driven out of the countries soon to be occupied by the Soviet Union. During their retreat, however, they destroy a Soviet tank that had stopped at the Lecter family's lodge looking for water. The explosion kills everyone but Lecter and Mischa. They survive in the cottage until five former Lithuanian militiamen, led by a Nazi collaborator named Vladis Grutas, storm and loot it. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Lecter and Mischa. By 1949, Lecter Castle has been turned into a Soviet orphanage and is ironically housing the interned orphan Hannibal Lecter. After dealing violently with a bully, Lecter escapes from the castle orphanage to Paris to live with his widowed aunt, the Lady Murasaki. While in France, Lecter flourishes as a student. He commits his first murder as a teenager, killing a local butcher who insults his aunt. He is suspected of the murder by Inspector Popil, a French detective who also lost his family in the war. Thanks in part to his aunt's intervention, Lecter escapes responsibility for the crime. Eventually, Lecter becomes the youngest person ever admitted to medical school in France. He works in Paris, where he is given a job preparing cadavers. One day, Lecter witnesses a condemned war criminal receiving a sodium thiopental injection, allowing him to recall details about his war crimes. Consequently, in an attempt to recall the names of those responsible for his sister's death, Lecter injects himself with the solution.

Madhavan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and Rancchoddas \\"Rancho\\" Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan) are three engineering students who share a room in a hostel at the Imperial College of Engineering, one of the best colleges in India. While Farhan and Raju are average students from modest backgrounds, Rancho is from a rich family. Farhan wants to become a wildlife photographer, but has joined engineering college to fulfil his father's wish. Raju on the other hand wants to uplift his family fortunes. Rancho is a wealthy genius who studies for the sheer joy of it. However, Rancho's passion is for knowledge and taking apart and building machines rather than the conventional obsession of the other students with exam ranks. With his different approach Rancho incurs the wrath of dean of college, Professor Viru Sahastrabudhhe (ViruS) (Boman Irani). Rancho irritates his lecturers by giving creative and unorthodox answers, and confronts ViruS after fellow student Joy Lobo hangs himself in his dormitory room. Joy had requested an extension on his major project on compassionate groundshis father had suffered a strokebut ViruS refused, saying that he himself was completely unmoved by his own son's accidental death after being hit by a train. Rancho denounces the rat race, dog-eat-dog, mindless rote learning mentality of the institution, blaming it for Lobo's death.Threatened by Rancho's talent and free spirit, ViruS labels him an \\"idiot\\" and attempts on a number of occasions to destroy his friendship with Farhan and Raju, warning them and their parents to steer clear of Rancho. In contrast, ViruS model student is Chatur Ramalingam or \\"Silencer\\", (Omi Vaidya) who sees a high rank at the prestigious college as his ticket to higher social status, corporate power, and therefore wealth.

A:","output":"In the movie \\"Three Idiots,\\" it is Raju Rastogi (played by Sharman Joshi) who recovers with the help of his friends, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Rancho (Aamir Khan). The three friends, who are engineering students, share a room in the hostel at the Imperial College of Engineering. Among the three, Raju comes from a modest background and is looking to uplift his family's fortune through education. Throughout the movie, Raju experiences significant challenges both academically and personally. The pressure to succeed academically and fulfill his family's dreams weighs heavily on him, and he struggles to cope with the expectations. His friends, Farhan and Rancho, support him by sharing their differing perspectives on life and education, helping Raju to begin questioning the conventional mindset of success and embracing his own aspirations. Rancho, in particular, plays an essential role in helping Raju regain confidence in himself. Through his unique approach to learning and constant challenge to the status quo, Rancho encourages Raju to adopt a more critical and innovative way of thinking. This instills in Raju a newfound sense of self-belief that enables him to push beyond the constraints that previously held him back. One pivotal moment in the movie sees Raju facing life-threatening injuries following a tragic accident. As he lies in a comatose state, it is Rancho who takes the lead and motivates Farhan in bringing Raju out of his unconscious state. They play a recording of the deceitful scheme that their college professor, ViruS, had been plotting against Raju, which shocks him back to consciousness. This incident highlights how the unwavering support and persistence of his friends, notably Rancho, helped restore Raju's faith in himself and his abilities. In addition to Raju's recovery, the film showcases how the three friends collectively support one another throughout their journey at the engineering college. They revel in their shared camaraderie, navigating the challenges posed by the institution and its traditionalist approach to education. While they each have unique goals and aspirations, their friendship remains the driving force that empowers them to break free from societal expectations and pursue their dreams. In conclusion, the character in the movie \\"Three Idiots\\" who recovers with the help of his friends is Raju Rastogi. The support from Farhan and, more significantly, Rancho, instills in him a renewed sense of confidence, allowing him to overcome various obstacles in his path. The film emphasizes the importance of friendship and the need to challenge conventional notions of success to achieve one's full potential. Investing in this film proposal could be a wise decision, considering the relatable themes and the powerful message it conveys about the value of friendship, self-belief, and the pursuit of one's true passions."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: What does Professor Oldman and his assistant plan to do at Hell House?

(CNN) -- After President Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968, many anti-gun politicians looked forward to the day when they could completely ban the sale and ownership of firearms and perhaps even confiscate those already in private hands. After the draconian legislation imposed restrictions on \\"dealing\\" firearms that resulted in the prosecution of countless innocent gun collectors, and recordkeeping on ammunition sales so useless that federal law enforcement agencies supported their repeal, Sen. Ted Kennedy wrote to the NRA to demand our support for a national gun licensing and registration system. A few years later, a Nixon administration advisory commission proposed that all side arms be outlawed and confiscated in about a decade. Within days, more than 300 vendors withdrew in protest as the NRA and others urged","output":"boycotts and expressed strong opposition to these proposed measures. The strong resistance from gun rights organizations, individual citizens, and various other groups led to a significant backlash against the politicians and policymakers who sought to limit or eliminate 2nd Amendment rights. Many in the pro-gun community protested that such measures would not only encroach upon their constitutional rights but also hinder the ability of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves, their families, and their property. The debate around gun control has since become one of the most hotly contested and polarizing issues in the United States. On one hand, proponents of stricter gun laws argue that reducing the availability of firearms by implementing measures such as national licensing and registration, background checks, and waiting periods will help decrease gun-related violence and crime. They often point to countries with restricted firearm access, lower gun ownership rates, and generally lower levels of gun-related crime to support their claims. On the other hand, gun rights advocates claim that criminals will always find a way to procure firearms regardless of the law, and that such measures only serve to disarm law-abiding citizens and leave them vulnerable. They argue that the 2nd Amendment was explicitly designed to provide citizens with the ability to defend themselves against threats, including those from an oppressive government, and that limiting this right only serves to further erode individual freedoms. Over the years, there have been numerous high-profile cases related to gun control and 2nd Amendment rights that have reached the Supreme Court, such as the landmark cases of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), which affirmed that American citizens have the individual right to possess firearms for self-defense purposes within their homes. Despite these legal victories for gun rights advocates, efforts to impose stricter gun control measures at both the state and federal level have persisted. Various cities and states across the country have implemented measures such as magazine capacity limits, assault weapon bans, and restrictions on concealed and open carry. While some of these measures have been relatively uncontroversial, others have drawn strong opposition from the pro-gun community, which views them as unnecessary, ineffective, or even unconstitutional in some cases. The fight over gun control has not been limited to legislatures and courts, but has also been marked by high-profile activism and advocacy efforts on both sides. In recent years, following tragic shootings such as the one in Parkland, Florida, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the March for Our Lives movement has brought together young people from around the country in support of gun control measures. Meanwhile, groups like the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and the Second Amendment Foundation continue to lobby and advocate on behalf of preserving and expanding gun rights. In summary, the gun control debate in the United States has a long and contentious history that includes overwhelming public outcry against proposed confiscation, landmark Supreme Court cases affirming the right to bear arms, ongoing legislative battles, and impassioned advocacy from supporters and opponents alike. As the dialogue on this divisive issue continues, both sides of the debate will undoubtedly persist in promoting their respective positions to protect what they see as fundamental rights and principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more teenagers die young happens, how will it affect LESS babies.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you have suggested involves more teenagers dying young, which would likely have direct and indirect effects on the process outlined. Direct Effects: 1. Reduction in the population: If more teenagers die young, then there will be fewer individuals transitioning into adulthood. As a result, there will be a reduction in the overall population, specifically in the young adult population. 2. Lower birth rates: Since there are fewer young adults, the number of individuals able to reproduce is also reduced. Consequently, there will be fewer babies born, resulting in a decrease in birth rates. Indirect Effects: 1. Altered age structure: With fewer individuals transitioning from teenagers to adults, the age structure of the population will be changed. There will be proportionally more children and elderly in the population, which may impact the distribution of resources and social dynamics. 2. Economic effects: A reduced young adult population and lower birth rates may have negative implications on the economy, such as a smaller workforce and less overall consumption. These economic effects could further exacerbate the decline in birth rates, as people may be more hesitant to have children in an unstable financial environment. 3. Psychological impact: The premature deaths of teenagers may affect the morale of their peers and the wider community. This could lead to changes in behaviors or attitudes that might impact birth rates, either directly (through reducing the desire to have children) or indirectly (by affecting mental health, which could, in turn, impact fertility). 4. Policy changes: The increase in teenage deaths might prompt governments to reassess their policies, especially those related to public health, education, and social welfare. Depending on these policies, they might either exacerbate or mitigate the decline in birth rates. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of more teenagers dying young would likely lead to fewer babies being born, both through direct and indirect effects on the population, economy, society, and political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise, the palace prisons are described as neat and tidy today and are connected to the 17th-century Baroque Bridge of Sighs. The mention of the prisons and the bridge implies that these structures were associated with the palace. In comparison, the hypothesis claims that the palace doesn't have prisons, and they were situated down the road. This statement contradicts the information provided in the premise directly. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as it offers an opposing viewpoint rather than following naturally from or being supported by the existing information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? A common worry when moving a cat is that the cat will need to eat, drink, or do its business. In general, when your cat goes into the carrier, it will go into hiding and resting mode, and won't want to do these things, anyway. To make the cat more comfortable, however, don't feed them anything, so they'll be able to ride without having to go to the bathroom. Some people suggest withholding food from the cat for 8 hours, if your cat gets car-sick regularly. If you're going on a longer trip, though, it's likely the cat won't eat during that time, so it's better to feed the cat normally leading up to the drive. If your trip will last less than one day, you don't need to worry about food, water, or bathroom breaks for the cat, and until your cat has a special medical concern it's much better to just leave your cat in the carrier while you're traveling, until you arrive at your destination. After eight hours or so, your cat will need a break and need to be let out for a trip to the litter box and some water.  If you're going on a multi-day drive, you can let the cat out of the carrier in the evenings at the hotel, or wherever you're staying. There, you can provide food and water, though cats will commonly only be interested in drinking a bit and using the litter box. Never, under any circumstances, leave a cat in the car. Cars can overheat extremely quickly, making them death traps for your pet. Leave the litter box easily accessible until the very last minute, when you're ready to put the cat into the carrier, then clean up the litter box and make it the last thing you bring, or discard. If you have an appropriately sized litter box, most cats won't try to use it to do their business. It's not recommended that you try to use a big carrier and put litter inside. Once you've got the cat inside the carrier, put the carrier in the car, or whatever you're moving with, and leave the cat alone as much as possible.  It's common to keep the carrier covered with a light blanket, as long as there is enough air circulation. Making the space dark can help to calm the cat down and encourage them to sleep. Don't stick your fingers through the cage, or move the carrier around, or attempt to let the cat out of the carrier. Just leave the cat alone to calm down. Try to keep the radio off, or very low, and keep your voices as low as possible during the trip. Loud sounds can be quite agitating for your cat, so Try to keep things no louder than the gentle hum of the air conditioner. Summary:","output":"When moving a cat, keep them in the carrier, consider withholding food prior to the trip, and provide breaks for food, water, and litter box use after 8 hours or at overnight stops; ensure proper ventilation, minimize noise, and never leave the cat in the car."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I went to the interview and was happy to get the job.","output":"Once upon a time in a small, serene village called Glenwood, there lived a young woman named Emily. Her life was quite ordinary, spending her days tending to her family's modest flower garden, reading books from the local library, and baking delicious pastries for her friends and family. However, Emily always felt like there was something missing in her life; a sense of purpose that she yearned to explore in the world beyond her village. One fateful day, as Emily was returning home from the library, she came across a vibrant flyer resting on the ground, caught in the grasp of a dandelion. Her curiosity piqued, she picked up the flyer and studied it closely. What she found excited her immensely: the poster advertised job openings at a prestigious hotel in a bustling city, Crestwell Heights. Emily's heart raced as she imagined working in the grand hotel, meeting new people, and taking on new responsibilities. She felt that fire inside her heart that she had desired for so long, and she knew she had to pursue this opportunity. Crestwell Heights was a few hours away from Glenwood, and Emily had to convince her family that this was the life-changing opportunity she needed. Initially, her parents argued that a quiet village life was safer and more suitable for her, but they eventually came around when they saw the determination and passion Emily had for this new journey. Bidding a teary farewell to her family and friends, Emily boarded the bus to Crestwell Heights, clutching the worn-out flyer tightly in her hands.  Upon arriving at the glamorous city, Emily was captivated by the bright lights and lively atmosphere. People from all walks of life filled the bustling streets, and Emily couldn't help but imagine the stories they carried with them. Despite her excitement, uncertainty filled her heart as she began to doubt her abilities in this competitive world. Pushing these thoughts to the back of her mind, she continued her quest to win the desired position at the Grand Crestwell Hotel. The next day, dressed elegantly and armed with her most confident smile, Emily arrived at the hotel, only to be met with numerous other applicants who had their eyes set on the same opportunity. This realization further intensified her fears; the competition was fierce, and Emily couldn't help but wonder if she would ever stand out among such experienced contenders. Despite her anxiety, she decided to give it her best shot. As the interview process began, Emily felt her heart beating in her chest like a drum, almost drowning out the voice of the interviewer. However, as the interview continued, she found her voice steady, articulating her experiences in Glenwood with pride and passion. She spoke about her love for flowers, her aptitude for arranging and creating beautiful bouquets, and her gift of making delicious pastries, sharing desserts she had baked for the interviewers to taste. By the end of the interview, Emily felt a bit more confident, knowing she had given her all. She returned to the small room she had rented, eagerly awaiting a response from the hotel, her dreams taking flight as she imagined herself working in the majestic place. A week passed by, and one fateful day, Emily received a letter with the Grand Crestwell Hotel crest embossed on the envelope. Her hands shook with anticipation as she opened it, her eyes scanning through each line until she found the words she had been longing for – \\"We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected for the position…\\" At that moment, joy and relief engulfed Emily, as the realization sunk in that obtaining this job meant much more than just embarking on a new adventure. It was the embodiment of her newfound purpose and the future she so eagerly wanted.

For example, if you're working on paper, you might write down the number of minutes and label it with the word \\" minutes. Select from the following. (I). \\" or if you're working on a spreadsheet, you could make a written manual. The totals will become more specific as the hours come.. (II). \\" if you're working online, this will help you remember to convert minutes to hours. If you have a computer, you may be able to skip setting your hours if you add everything to minute.. (III). \\" if you're using a calculator, just type in the number. As an example, let's say that we want to find out how many hours a 150 minute movie will be.. (IV). \\" write it in a box when you're finished. Use the calculator code to do your convert.. The answer is:","output":"(III). \\" if you're using a calculator, just type in the number. As an example, let's say that we want to find out how many hours a 150 minute movie will be..\\" This is the most accurate choice because it directly addresses a practical method of converting minutes to hours using a calculator. The process is quite simple: Enter the number of minutes that you need to convert (in this case, 150), and then divide that number by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.  For example: 150 minutes ÷ 60 = 2.5 hours This tells us that the 150-minute movie has a duration of 2.5 hours. This method works with almost any digital device that has a calculator function, including smartphones, tablets, computers, or dedicated calculators.  It's important to remember, even when working with other methods or tools like spreadsheets or writing manuals, the fundamental principle remains the same. That is, the conversion from minutes to hours is always accomplished by dividing the number of minutes by 60.  Choice (I), although mentioning a more specific evaluation system, doesn't provide a direct manner for conversion. Choices (II) and (IV) are not clear and do not provide any practical direction for the conversion from minutes to hours based on the context provided.  Hence, Choice (III) is the most accurate and instructive option among the given choices for converting minutes to hours."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the below context:  The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible.

On the left side: -1892 * u + 1094 * u On the right side: -1094 * u + 3192 + 1094 * u Since the -1094 * u and the +1094 * u cancel each other out on the right side of the equation, we end up with: Step 2: -1892 * u + 1094 * u = 3192 Now, we combine the terms with u on the left side.

He attended the University of San Francisco, where he led the Dons to two consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956. After completing his college, Russell joined the Boston Celtics in December 1956. Under the guidance of the legendary coach Red Auerbach, Russell quickly became the team's defensive anchor. His shot-blocking, rebounding, and overall defensive prowess changed the face of basketball, as he introduced a fresh defensive approach that the league had not yet seen. During his 13-year tenure in Boston, the team won an incredible 11 NBA championships, including an impressive streak of eight championships in a row from 1959 to 1966. This mark remains unbroken to this day. Furthermore, Russell was also named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1959. Russell's individual achievements include five regular-season MVP awards (1958, 1961-1963, and 1965). He was named to the All-NBA First Team three times (1959, 1963, and 1965) and the All-NBA Second Team eight times. Russell was also an All-Star in 12 of his 13 seasons. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, and the NBA named him one of its 50 Greatest Players in 1996. It isn't only his impressive championship pedigree that makes Bill Russell the epitome of NBA success. His commitment to civil rights, combined with his influence on the court as a player, coach, and pioneer, established him as a seminal figure in the history of the sport. As a coach, Russell was a trailblazer, becoming the first African-American head coach in any major professional sports league in the United States when he assumed the role of a player-coach for the Boston Celtics in 1966. While players like Michael Jordan and LeBron James continue to dominate conversations about the greatest players in NBA history, Bill Russell's record 11 rings make him the most successful in terms of championships. His contributions to the game, both on and off the court, have left an enduring legacy that continues to shape the sport as we know it today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"shootout at indian space facility\\" Text:","output":"Title: The Dramatic Shootout at an Indian Space Facility Introduction: A riveting incident unfolded at one of India's top space research facilities, with a dramatic shootout taking place between security forces and unidentified assailants. The space center, which has been instrumental in shaping the nation's space program, was put on high alert as authorities scrambled to prevent a catastrophe. This article delves into the harrowing details of this critical situation and explores its potential implications on India's space program. Step 1: Background on Indian Space Facility The Indian space facility plays a vital role in the nation's space endeavors, launching satellites, and conducting various space exploration projects. Its location is strategic, with cutting-edge equipment and technology that are critical to India's standing in the global space race. As such, the facility is heavily secured and the on-site personnel are trained to handle emergencies. Step 2: Initial Reports of Intrusion The shootout began when security personnel at the facility detected a breach at one of the facility's checkpoints. Surveillance footage revealed a group of armed, unidentified individuals attempting to gain unauthorized access. Upon the discovery of the intrusion, the facility's security team immediately responded, initiating a facility-wide lockdown and alerting local law enforcement. Step 3: Confrontation between Security Forces and Assailants With the facility's security and law enforcement personnel on high alert, a brutal confrontation soon ensued. Gunfire was exchanged between the assailants and the guards as the intruders made their way further into the facility's classified zones. Several security forces and assailants were injured in the crossfire, with casualty numbers rising as the shootout persisted. Step 4: Reinforcements and Crisis Management Given the severity of the situation, additional police and special forces were called in to eliminate the threat and secure the facility. Meanwhile, facility staff worked tirelessly to ensure that vital systems remained operational during the turmoil. The swift crisis management efforts were crucial in containing the situation and preventing potential catastrophic damages to the space program infrastructure. Step 5: Conclusion of the Shootout and Investigation After several intense hours, the assailants were neutralized, and the facility was declared secure. With the immediate danger averted, law enforcement shifted their focus towards investigating the origins of the attackers and their intended objectives. Speculations about potential espionage or sabotage have emerged but remain unconfirmed until the investigation yields conclusive results. Conclusion: The shootout at the Indian space facility stands as a stark reminder of the threats and challenges facing national security in the era of space exploration. It also highlights the importance of robust countermeasures and preparedness in defending critical establishments from malicious attacks. As the investigation continues, it is hoped that the incident's motivations will be uncovered, allowing for improvements in the facility's security measures and overall protection of India's space program."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is the general music director of the Berlin State Opera, and the Staatskapelle Berlin; he previously served as Music Director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris and La Scala in Milan. Barenboim is known for his work with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, a Seville-based orchestra of young Arab and Israeli musicians, and as a resolute critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Barenboim has received many awards and prizes, including an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, France's Legion d'honneur both as a Commander and Grand Officier, and the German Grosses Bundesverdienstkreuz and Willy Brandt Award. Daniel Barenboim was born in 1942 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Argentinian-Jewish parents Aida (nee Schuster) and Enrique Barenboim. He started piano lessons at the age of five with his mother, continuing to study with his father, who remained his only teacher. On 19 August 1950, at the age of seven, he gave his first formal concert in his hometown, Buenos Aires.  In 1952, Barenboim's family moved to Israel. Two years later, in the summer of 1954, his parents took him to Salzburg to take part in Igor Markevitch's conducting classes. During that summer he also met and played for Wilhelm Furtwangler, who has remained a central musical influence and ideal for Barenboim. Furtwangler called the young Barenboim a \\"phenomenon\\" and invited him to perform the Beethoven First Piano Concerto with the Berlin Philharmonic, but Barenboim's father considered it too soon after the Second World War for a child of Jewish parents to be performing in Berlin. In 1955 Barenboim studied harmony and composition with Nadia Boulanger in Paris.  On 15 June 1967, Barenboim and British cellist Jacqueline du Pre were married in Jerusalem at a Western Wall ceremony, Du Pre having converted to Judaism. Acting as one of the witnesses was the conductor Zubin Mehta, a long-time friend of Barenboim. Since \\"I was not Jewish I had to temporarily be renamed Moshe Cohen, which made me a 'kosher witness',\\" Mehta recalled. Du Pre retired from music in 1973, after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). The marriage lasted until du Pre's death in 1987.  In the early 1980s, Barenboim began an affair with the Russian pianist Elena Bashkirova, with whom he had two sons born in Paris before du Pre's death: David Arthur, born 1983, and Michael, born 1985. Barenboim worked to keep his relationship with Bashkirova hidden from du Pre, and believed he had succeeded. He and Bashkirova married in 1988. Both sons are part of the music world: David is a manager-writer for the German hip-hop band Level 8, and Michael Barenboim is a classical violinist.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was a witness to their marriage?","output":"A witness to Daniel Barenboim and Jacqueline du Pre's marriage was the conductor Zubin Mehta."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"World Wide Web links were once listed in a directory.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the paragraph provided, we can conclude that World Wide Web links were once listed in a directory. The paragraph discusses DMOZ, which was a multilingual open-content directory of World Wide Web links. This directory was constructed and maintained by a community of volunteer editors, and it was owned by AOL (a part of Verizon's Oath Inc.). DMOZ, or the Open Directory Project (ODP), aimed at organizing and categorizing web links into a centralized location, making it easier for users to find relevant resources on the internet. The directory followed a hierarchical structure, with numerous categories and sub-categories branching from a single root directory. Individual web pages were submitted, reviewed, and added by volunteer editors to ensure the maintenance of quality and accuracy within the directory. The DMOZ model was used as a starting point for many other search engines and directories, as it provided a curated selection of reliable and categorized websites. At its peak, DMOZ contained over 3 million URLs and had more than 80,000 volunteer editors, who were responsible for selecting, evaluating, and organizing web links. DMOZ's data was also used as a basis for other search engines such as Google and Netscape, highlighting its influence in the early days of the World Wide Web. Despite the historical significance of DMOZ and its role in the evolution of online search and directories, the project faced numerous challenges and criticisms throughout its existence. These challenges included the limitations of volunteer editors' time, the sheer volume of web pages that needed to be reviewed and added, conflicts of interest among editors, and the potential for spam and malicious websites to be included in the directory. As the internet grew in size and complexity, and new search technologies such as Google's search algorithms emerged, the relevance and utility of web directories like DMOZ diminished. Users began to rely more on search engines for finding information, rather than browsing through a list of categorized links in a directory. As a result, DMOZ's significance waned, and it eventually closed in March 2017. In summary, the paragraph above allows us to conclude that World Wide Web links were once listed in a directory, specifically referencing DMOZ, the Open Directory Project. While DMOZ played a substantial role in the early organization of the internet and served as an inspiration for other search engines and directories, its relevance decreased with the advancement of search technologies and the exponential growth of the World Wide Web."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"In American football , each team has eleven players on the field at one time.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"In American football, each team has eleven players on the field at one time. However, this does not fully answer the question of who usually catches the football. The players who primarily catch the football are wide receivers, running backs, and tight ends. These positions are part of the offensive team, and their main responsibility is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback.  Wide receivers are the players who typically line up near the sidelines and run different routes to create separation from the defenders in order to catch passes down the field. Running backs, on the other hand, are usually positioned in the backfield and may catch shorter passes or screens. Tight ends primarily line up next to offensive linemen and can serve as both pass catchers and blockers. They often catch passes over the middle or in the flat (short sidelines) area of the field. While these three positions are the primary pass catchers, occasionally other players, such as fullbacks, can also be targeted by the quarterback in certain play situations. On the defensive side, defensive backs and linebackers may also catch the football, albeit unintentionally, when they intercept a pass intended for an offensive player. In summary, wide receivers, running backs, and tight ends are the players who usually catch the football in American football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more. And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye. \\"I don't understand, Dingo.\\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling.

Erschallet, ihr Lieder is the third of the Weimar cantatas. It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His  temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\"....

The Seven Ages of Man is a series of paintings by Robert Smirke, derived from a monologue from William Shakespeare's \\"As You Like It\\", spoken as the melancholy Jaques in Act II Scene VII. The phrase begins as \\"all the world's a stage\\". The stages referred are: infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, justice, pantaloon and old age. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The Seven Ages of Man is a interpretation  As You Like which is a comedy","output":"Yes, the next sentence somewhat follows the preceding text but requires a few modifications for better flow and accuracy. The Seven Ages of Man is an interpretation from Shakespeare's \\"As You Like It,\\" which is a pastoral comedy. This interpretation by Robert Smirke is inspired by a monologue given by the melancholy character Jaques, in Act II Scene VII, where he describes the various stages of human life by likening it to actors playing different roles on stage. This idea was metaphorically expressed by the phrase, \\"all the world's a stage.\\" In \\"As You Like It,\\" the Seven Ages of Man are depicted through the different phases of human life, which include the infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, justice, pantaloon, and old age. By illustrating these stages, Smirke provides a visual representation of the concepts discussed in the play and brings to life the essence of Shakespeare's timeless narrative about the human condition. The pastoral comedy aspect of \\"As You Like It\\" is primarily focused on the banishment and subsequent events surrounding the main characters Rosalind and Orlando. The play is set predominantly in the Forest of Arden, with themes of love, disguise, and a return to the simplicity of nature. It includes elements of humor and wit intertwined with the complexities of love and relationships, which further adds to the comedic value. Meanwhile, the monologue by Jaques on the Seven Ages of Man serves to offer a more profound and philosophical reflection on the nature of life and the roles people take on throughout their lifetime. In conclusion, the next sentence could be modified as follows: \\"The Seven Ages of Man, depicted in a series of paintings by Robert Smirke, is an interpretation derived from Shakespeare's pastoral comedy 'As You Like It,' which paints a vivid picture of life stages through the metaphorical concept that all the world's a stage.\\""},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Cockrum is an unincorporated community located in Desoto County, Mississippi, Cockrum is approximately 7 mi north of Independence and 12 mi south of Olive Branch along Mississippi Highway 305, Olive Branch is a city, in which county in Mississippi, United States?

The title \\"Judge Harris\\" persisted even after his involvement in the American Civil War and suggests that he had earned a respected reputation within the legal system due to his service as a judge. Furthermore, the context implies that this was not the only position he held, as it is mentioned that the title \\"Judge Harris\\" remained in use even after his election to Congress. This election to Congress demonstrates the versatile nature of John Thomas Harris's career, having transitioned from the judiciary branch (as a judge) to the legislative branch (as a member of Congress). Considering his background in law and politics, it is reasonable to assume that he was adept in navigating the political landscape and was able to further contribute to the American political system through this new role. Moreover, his first cousin, John Hill, implies the potential for family ties in the realm of politics and law in this period. To sum up the hypothesis: John Thomas Harris, who was widely known as \\"Judge Harris\\" due to his background as a judge, lawyer, and politician in Virginia, was elected to Congress following the American Civil War.

Summarize: Bonnie Strachan died at Ipswich Hospital on 24 January after being deprived of oxygen when she was delivered feet first. Her parents, Emma and James Strachan, had decided against a caesarean. An inquest heard too few professionals were experienced in vaginal breech deliveries. In this case guidelines stated that a consultant who was an expert in such deliveries should have been present but he failed to attend. Giving evidence, Mrs Strachan, 29, of Framlingham, said: \\"We do not feel we had properly been made aware of the risks of a vaginal breech delivery.\\" Suffolk coroner Peter Dean said he would be writing to the chief medical officer to emphasise the importance of having a consultant present for such high risk deliveries. \\"I hope this will prevent similar tragic circumstances in future,\\" he added. Reaching a narrative conclusion, Dr Dean said: \\"Bonnie died from complications following a prolonged final phase of a breech delivery. \\"The presence of a consultant would have led to an earlier delivery and the immediate prospects for survival would have been improved. \\"Whether the ultimate outcome would have been successful simply cannot be established.\\" The inquest heard consultant obstetrician Andrew Leather did not attend the delivery in contravention of the hospital's own guidelines. He said that in hindsight he should have attended instead of leaving a registrar who had previously performed only two breech deliveries to take charge. \\"Retrospectively I obviously made an error of judgment and in future I will always attend regardless of the experience of who is present, but I was misled by our telephone conversation.\\" Registrar Bethany Revell said she spoke to Mr Leather three times on the phone and there was confusion over whether he would attend. After emerging feet first, the family felt Bonnie was \\"left hanging\\" before midwives decided to release her arms and head. The inquest heard that with her umbilical cord compressed, a 10-minute window of opportunity in which to deliver Bonnie before foetal reserves were exhausted was missed. Speaking outside the inquest, Mrs Strachan said: \\"We hope lessons can be learned to avoid further preventable baby deaths. We would like to instigate real change.\\" Their solicitor Guy Forster, from Irwin Mitchell, said the couple had never been interested in a witch hunt. \\"We hope this conclusion can influence policy locally but also nationally,\\" he added. \\"The coroner's decision to write to the chief medical officer is very significant and hopefully that will bring about a real change.\\" Summary:","output":"Bonnie Strachan died at Ipswich Hospital due to oxygen deprivation during a feet-first (breech) delivery.

Buy lubricated condoms for a more comfortable sexual experience. Purchase colored, scented, or flavored condoms for extra fun. Get female condoms as an alternative to male condoms.\\"","output":"Title: Choosing the Perfect Condom: A Comprehensive Guide to Enhancing Your Sexual Experience Introduction In today's world, condoms play a crucial role in promoting safe sex and preventing the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). With a plethora of options available, selecting the perfect condom may seem rather daunting. Keeping in mind the preferences of both you and your partner, this guide will explore different condom types, materials, sizes, and textures. We will also provide recommendations for lubricated, colored, scented, flavored condoms, and female condoms. Understanding the abundant options can help enhance your sexual experience while maintaining safety and protection. 1. Material Matters Condoms are made from various materials, each offering unique benefits. These materials are typically categorized into three groups: latex, non-latex, and lambskin. a) Latex: The most common and affordable option, latex condoms provide excellent protection against STIs and pregnancy. However, they may cause discomfort or allergic reactions for those sensitive to latex. b) Non-Latex: These condoms are made from materials such as polyurethane, polyisoprene, or nitrile. They offer an alternative to people with latex allergies and can provide equal protection against STIs. Polyurethane condoms offer higher heat transmission, while polyisoprene is stretchier and more comfortable. c) Lambskin: Composed of natural lamb intestine, these condoms provide a more natural feel but do not offer protection against STIs. They are recommended for monogamous couples in search of enhanced sensation while preventing pregnancy. 2. Size and Fit Finding the right condom size is crucial for optimal protection and comfort. Condom sizes are determined by girth rather than length. Measure your erect penis girth and consult a size chart to determine the appropriate condom size. a) Regular: For those with an average girth, standard-sized condoms should suffice. Make sure the condom is not too tight, as it could risk breakage. b) Snug: Men with a narrower girth may need to consider snugger fitting condoms to prevent slippage during sex. c) Large: For those with a larger girth, a larger or magnum-sized condom provides comfort without compromising safety. 3. Texture: A World of Sensations Condom manufacturers have expanded their range to include textured condoms, designed to enhance pleasure for both partners. Some popular options include: a) Ribbed: These condoms have raised ridges to intensify friction and pleasure for the receptive partner.  b) Studded: Equipped with small raised dots, these condoms provide extra stimulation during intercourse.  c) Ultra-Thin: For couples seeking a more natural feel, ultra-thin condoms transmit body heat and sensations for a more intimate experience. 4. Lubrication: Ease and Comfort Lubricated condoms come pre-coated with a water or silicone-based lubricant for a smoother and more comfortable sexual experience. Non-lubricated condoms allow couples to choose their preferred lubricant, but care must be taken to use a lubricant compatible with the condom material, as oil-based lubricants can damage latex. 5. Colors, Scents, and Flavors: Adding an Extra Spark Inject excitement into your sex life by exploring colored, scented, or flavored condoms. These options appeal to the senses and bring an element of playfulness into the bedroom. Flavored condoms are especially popular for oral sex, as they mask any unpleasant latex odors or tastes. 6. Female Condoms: An Alternative Approach Female condoms serve as an alternative to traditional male condoms and empower women to take control of their protection. They are worn internally by the female partner, lining the vagina to prevent pregnancy and STIs. Female condoms are typically made from nitrile and can be used in combination with any lubricant. Conclusion The wide array of condom options available today caters to various preferences, ensuring a satisfying and safe sexual experience. By considering material, size, texture, lubrication, and novelty features, you and your partner can find the perfect condom and build a stronger bond during your intimate moments. With protection and pleasure in mind, always remember to communicate openly and strive for a mutually satisfying experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. For air dielectric capacitors the breakdown field strength is of the order 2 to 5 MV/m; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 MV/m; for oil, 15 to 25 MV/m; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric. The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): In what way is the dielectric used in order to cause the absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors to be limited?","output":"Alright, let me explain this to you in a simple way. Think of a capacitor as a sandwich. The bread slices are the metal plates and the filling is the dielectric material. This filling helps to store energy without letting the electricity flow directly between the metal plates. Now, the dielectric material can only handle a certain amount of electric field strength before it breaks down, kind of like the sandwich filling squishing out if you press too hard. For different materials, there's a different maximum strength they can handle. When the strength gets too high, it can cause a small hole in the dielectric, allowing electricity to flow between the plates, and sometimes leading to dramatic failure. The dielectric is used in very thin layers to maximize the amount of energy the capacitor can store. But as the voltage increases, the layers have to be made thicker to prevent breakdown. This means that the capacitance (how much energy it can store) of the capacitor will be limited by the material and thickness of the dielectric.

It is this respect that makes us human. Without respect, we become animals. We need to respect our friends for our friendship. We even need to respect our enemies because they help us to grow up and become stronger. Respect is one of the crucial values in a relationship. Love Love is everything. With love in our hearts, we feel no need to hurt another. With love in our hearts, we will pay more attention to the similarities in opinions rather than the disagreement. If we want others to be good to us, we need to be good to them. After all, we give love to get love, right? Loyalty People often ignore   the meaning and importance of loyalty. Loyalty is necessary for people to believe in each other. In no matter what kind of friendship, we need to believe in each other so that we can work together towards the same goal. Honesty Honesty is to show other people who we really are. Honesty helps to do better, because it makes us realize our problems and find ways to solve them.

Title: Who Framed Roger Rabbit Movie plot: In 1947, \\"toons\\" act out theatrical cartoon shorts as with live-action films; they regularly interact with real people and animals and reside in Toontown, an animated portion of Los Angeles. Private detective Eddie Valiant and his brother, Teddy, once worked closely with the toons on several famous cases, but after Teddy was killed by a toon, Eddie lapsed into alcoholism and vowed never to work for toons again. One day, R.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoon Studios, is concerned about the recent poor acting performances of one of his biggest stars, Roger Rabbit. Maroon hires Valiant to investigate rumors about Roger's voluptuous toon wife Jessica being romantically involved with businessman and gadgets inventor, Marvin Acme, owner of both Acme Corporation and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at the underground Ink &amp; Paint Club, Valiant secretly takes photographs of her and Acme playing patty-cake in her dressing room, which he shows to Roger. Maroon suggests to Roger that he should leave Jessica, but a drunken Roger refuses and flees. The next morning, Acme is discovered dead at his factory with a safe dropped on his head, and evidence points to Roger being responsible. While investigating, Valiant meets Judge Doom, Toontown's Superior Court judge, who has created a substance capable of killing a toon: a toxic chemical known as \\"The Dip\\". Valiant runs into Roger's toon co-star, Baby Herman, who believes Roger is innocent and that Acme's missing will, which will give the toons ownership of Toontown, may be the key to his murder. He then finds Roger hiding in his office, who begs him to help exonerate him. Valiant reluctantly hides Roger in a local bar where his ex-girlfriend, Dolores, works. Later, Jessica approaches Valiant and says that Maroon had forced her to pose for the photographs so that he could blackmail Acme. Doom and his toon-weasel henchmen discover Roger, but he and Valiant escape with Benny, an anthropomorphic toon cab. They flee to a theater, where Valiant tells Roger about Teddy's...

Kelly is a prostitute who shows up in the small town of Grantville, just one more burg in a long string of quick stops on the run after being chased out of the big city by her former pimp. She engages in a quick tryst with local police captain Griff, who then tells her to stay out of his town and refers her to a cat-house just across the state line. Instead, she decides to give up her illicit lifestyle, becoming a nurse at a hospital for handicapped children. Griff doesn't trust reformed prostitutes, however, and continues trying to run her out of town. Kelly falls in love with J.L. Grant, the wealthy scion of the town's founding family, an urbane sophisticate, and Griff's best friend. After a dream-like courtship where even Kelly's admission of her past can't deter Grant, the two decide to marry. It is only after Kelly is able to finally convince Griff that she truly loves Grant and has given up prostitution for good that he agrees to be their best man. Shortly before the wedding, Kelly arrives at Grant's mansion, only to find him on the verge of molesting a small girl. As he grinningly tries to persuade her to marry him, arguing that she too is a deviant, the only one who can understand him, and that he loves her, Kelly kills him by striking him in the head with a phone receiver. Jailed, and under heavy interrogation from Griff, she must convince him and the town that she is telling the truth about Grant's death.

The sentence translates to \\"This fact demonstrates in itself the wholesomeness of our agri-food chain.\\" in English. French is a Romance language that stems from the Indo-European language family. It is one of the most spoken languages globally, particularly in Europe, Africa, Canada, and some parts of the Caribbean, South America, and Oceania. France is the main country where French is spoken, but it is also an official language in countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Monaco, and the Canadian province of Quebec. As a former colonial empire, France has significant influence in many countries in Africa, and French is the official language of countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Mali, and more. The French language has heavily influenced English throughout history, and many French loanwords are used in everyday English conversation. This is largely due to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, which resulted in the intertwining of the Old French and Old English languages. As a result, approximately 30% of English words have a French origin. French is usually regarded as an international language, being one of the six official languages of the United Nations, the main working language of the European Union, and an important language for diplomacy, business, and communication. The French language is known for its contribution to literature, philosophy, and various arts. Many famous writers, philosophers, and thinkers come from the French-speaking world, including Victor Hugo, Marcel Proust, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre, to name a few. Learning French can provide access to a rich cultural and historical heritage while enabling communication with millions of French speakers worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens with a young, blonde-haired woman outdoors during a rainstorm. She is seen struggling on her knees, and she manages to stumble into a home. The occupants, learning that the pregnant woman is about to go into labour, make preparations for her birth. With some difficulty, the unnamed woman gives birth to a baby boy (played by Joseph Shiner), with the assistance of a midwife, known as Mrs. Corney (Anne Tirard). The woman, barely able to speak, asks to see her son. When he is given to her, she smiles weakly at him and kisses the baby's forehead before she collapses and dies. Witnessing the woman's birth is Mr. Bumble (Timothy West), a hard-nosed man in charge of the local orphans workhouse. With no information on the mother's identity, he gives the boy the name Oliver Twist. Like the other boys in the workhouse, Oliver lives a hard life of endless labour and schooling, with only a bowl of gruel for supper, while Bumble and Corney sits above them feasting on food such as leg of lamb. After seeing his half-starved friend Dick devour his bowl and still wanting more, Oliver, in a gesture of compassion, offers the lad his own, then goes up to Bumble and asks for more, unaware of the consequences. His request angers Bumble, who hires him out to work for Mr Sowerberry, a local undertaker. Sowerberry exploits Oliver's pathetic features by using him as a silent mourner, present at burials for the dead who are without family or friends, many of them children. Oliver's situation is not much different than the workhouse, as he is given a workbench to sleep on and scraps that Sowerberry's dogs refuse to eat for food. Oliver also becomes the object of Noah Claypole's (Philip Davis) hatred. Claypole, a teenager, has been assigned to supervise Oliver. He gives Oliver harsh tasks and becomes further resentful when Sowerberry decides to use Oliver instead of him for silent mourner duties.

Originally a trio , the group eventually became a duo including Yarimar Huertas and Yalixia Figueroa .  - Reggaeton (also known as reggaetón and reguetón) is a musical genre which originated in Puerto Rico during the late 1990s. It is influenced by hip hop and Latin American and Caribbean music. Vocals include rapping and singing, typically in Spanish.  - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Rapping (or emceeing, MCing, or rhyming) is \\"spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics\\". The components of rapping include \\"content\\", \\"flow\\" (rhythm and rhyme), and \\"delivery\\". Rapping is distinct from spoken-word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat (external meter). Rapping is often associated with and a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon can be said to predate hip-hop culture by centuries. It can also be found in alternative rock such as that of Cake, Gorillaz and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rapping is also used in Kwaito music, a genre that originated in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is composed of hip-hop elements. Another form of rap that predates hip hop was Muhammad Ali's rhythmic poetry used to taunt his opponents in the 1960s and 1970s.  - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'signs ' with the relationship of 'genre'.  Choices: - art  - blues  - dance  - jazz  - music  - musical  - opera  - percussion  - pop  - popular music  - rapping  - reggae  - reggaeton  - religious music  - rhythm  - rhythm and blues  - rock  - romance  - ska  - symphony  - variety The answer is:","output":"reggaeton"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She decides to journey on a path of self-discovery and redemption to reclaim her lost dignity and reshape her life's narrative. Act I: Judy, a loving wife and mother, has spent her entire life looking after her family, often prioritizing the needs of her husband and children over her own. As a result, she feels stuck in a thankless role and unfulfilled, battling constant feelings of inadequacy. Her loving husband, Sam, struggles to support her due to his commitment to his demanding job, leaving Judy feeling unheard and unappreciated. Act II: A turning point comes when Judy discovers her childhood diary with an entry about her dreams of becoming a professional dancer. This revelation awakens a deep longing within her, stirring up memories of her childhood passion. Fueled by this rediscovered love for dance, Judy decides to pursue her dream and join a local dance class. As Judy invests her time picking up dance lessons, Sam begins to question her new hobby, thinking that her priorities are misplaced. Judy's children are not supportive either, reacting with confusion and embarrassment. In spite of these challenges, she remains steadfast in her pursuit of dance. Judy ultimately forms a group of friends in class who share similar stories and aspirations, providing her with the emotional support she has lacked for years. Act III: Judy's confidence grows, and she rediscovers the sense of self she had lost over the years. The dance studio announces a regional talent competition, and she decides to participate with her new friends. Her family, though not initially on board, starts to recognize the positive transformation in her attitude and resilience and decides to support her in the competition. As the competition approaches, Judy faces her most significant hurdle yet; she learns that her husband, Sam, was offered a promotion that requires him to relocate, demanding Judy to give up her newfound passion. This time, however, Judy reclaims her dignity by standing up for her dreams. Touched by her determination, Sam decides to turn down the promotion, realizing the importance of Judy's happiness and the need to focus on their relationship. The movie reaches its climax as Judy takes the stage at the competition, her family cheering her on. Though she doesn't win first place, she leaves the stage beaming with pride, having reclaimed her dignity and realizing her dream. Judy's journey of self-discovery brings her family closer than ever, as they learn the value of supporting one another's dreams and embracing their individuality.

Title: Blind Faith Movie plot: In Toms River, New Jersey, the Marshalls â Rob (Urich) and Maria (Kerns), and their three sons, 18-year-old Roby (Barry Gray), 17-year-old Chris (Jay Underwood) and 12-year-old John (Johnny Galecki) â are an apparently happy family living the American Dream. But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of 100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond (Robin Strasser). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed. Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal (Joe Spano) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman. As all evidence seems to point to Rob, Felice breaks off their relationship, which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel. By this point, Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty. Roby and John are both shocked to hear this, strongly believing in their father's innocence. Rob admits to Sal that he hired Ferlin L'Heureux (William Forsythe), a private detective, on the night his wife was killed to find out how he...

Options: - airport - come home - train station - taxi station - bus depot  Explain why a human would choose \\"bus depot\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"The selection of \\"bus depot\\" as the answer to the question assumes transportation selection based on the distance to be traveled and the amount of money the travelers have.  Among the options provided, both the airport and train station generally cater to long-distance travel and are often more expensive modes of transport. Thus, they may not be suitable if the travelers don't have much money and don't have far to travel. Taxis, which can be picked up at a taxi station, offer a more direct route to a destination, but are typically more expensive than public transportation, may also not work for travelers on a tight budget.  On the other hand, buses, which depart from a bus depot, typically serve local areas and short distances and are a more economical form of public transportation. This would make them a more suitable option for travelers who don't have much money but also don't have a far distance to travel. So, considering all this information related to various forms of transportation, \\"bus depot\\" makes the most sense as the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...  Now, I have a new situation: Molly and Brian are two friends who moved away from one another after becoming close in college. They still talk on the phone regularly and see each other a couple times a year. During a recent conversation, the subject of population comes up. Molly's town is currently increasing a steady decrease in population, and Brian's town has been seeing an increase in population.  Answer this question please: An Allee effect is not currently happening in which town? A:","output":"An Allee effect is not currently happening in Brian's town. Brian's town has been experiencing an increase in population, which generally results in a larger gene pool, greater genetic diversity, and less chance of experiencing the negative consequences associated with an Allee effect. As mentioned earlier, an Allee effect tends to manifest in populations where individuals face a decline in population size, leading to a loss of genetic diversity and potential inbreeding depression, as observed in the case of the Florida panther. An increased population, such as the one in Brian's town, would typically not suffer from these genetic issues, making it less susceptible to the Allee effect."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: It's illegal for the police to attach a GPS unit to your car without your permission, as the U.S. Supreme Court settled in 2012.But if the police are in hot pursuit of a bank robber or other escaping criminals that threaten public safety, a GPS tracker is acceptable. But exactly how can the police GPS track a car that is moving fast? The answer to that question comes from StarChase,a new police technology being used by a small but growing number of law enforcement agencies.It allows the police to fire 4.5-inch glue-covered GPS bullet-like projectiles from an air gun fixed in their police cars.If the GPS tracker makes contact with the escaping robber's car, it'll stick no matter how fast the vehicle is going.That way, the police will have a constant read on the car's location and heading.Aside from simply apprehending criminals,it's believed this new technology could help save lives.If the police successfully fire a GPS unit at a speeding criminal,they can pull back from a high-risk chase.Chases can be incredibly dangerous to all involved,including innocent bystanders and other drivers.Once the GPS bullet connects,there's no need for the chase any longer. Now,predictably,a GPS-loaded gun isn't cheap. Police departments need to pay about   5.000 per vehicle for the technology,and individual GPS bullets cost as much as 250 each.That may sound expensive,but remember:The alternative is often thousands of dollars in property damage,and great human cost in injury and lost life.According to Star Chase,their GPS bullet system has an apprehension rate of 80%without any report of inury or property damage.If you'd like to learn more about the StarChase system,Popular Mechanics has just published a good article about it.There's also plenty more information available at the company's website.

UPDATED:. 19:41 EST, 21 December 2012. Accused: John Bushell, 86, is accused of trying to smear his neighbours to undermine their evidence in court against him. A pensioner has been accused of making false criminal allegations about the couple who lived next door to discredit what they said against him in a court case. John Bushell, 86, is alleged to have called police on September 27 to say his neighbours, Kenneth and Marjorie Mills, had damaged the guttering on his property. The retired book-keeper - who has been involved in a long-running feud with Mr and Mrs Mills - is already banned from contacting them under the terms of a restraining order made in 1998. Tensions have grown during the five decades they have lived next door to each other in a cul-de-sac in Hebburn, South Tyneside. Yesterday, Bushell appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court facing a charge of committing an act intending to pervert the course of justice. Bushell is said to have contacted the police about the alleged damage to undermine his neighbours’ credibility before they stood as witnesses against him in a different court case. He was originally due to appear before magistrates about the latest charge last Thursday, but did not turn up. At that point, he was facing the less serious matter of wasting police time. Paul Anderson, prosecuting, asked the court to withdraw that charge and replace it with the new one - which can only be dealt with at crown court. Bushell entered no plea and spoke only to confirm his name, age and address. Mr Anderson said: ‘A charge of. perverting the course of justice is indictable only, meaning it must be. sent to Newcastle Crown Court.’ Christopher Brown, defending, said he didn’t want to add anything on Bushell’s behalf. Bushell will appear at Newcastle Crown Court on January 4, where it is expected he will enter a plea. He was released on unconditional bail until then. Earlier this month, Bushell was found guilty of breaching an order after he hurled abuse at his neighbours on May 7. Neighbours: Marjorie Mills and husband Ken, of Hebburn, South Tynesid, had in a long-running feud with John Bushell. Feud: John Bushell, who lived in the house on the left, a few yards from neighbours the Mills family who live next door, on the right. Court action: Retired book-keeper John Bushell will appear at Newcastle Crown Court on January 4, where it is expected he will enter a plea. South Tyneside magistrates deferred his sentence for six months. Bushell admitted shouting at Mr and Mrs Mills, but said he had been provoked by them filming him. Speaking after Bushell’s conviction, Mr and Mrs Mills said they wanted to call an end to their feud. Mrs Mills said: ‘All we want to do is to be able to enjoy our lives in peace.' Bushell, who lives with wife Sonia in. the cul-de-sac, said he has listened to the magistrates and will do his. best to keep the peace. Speaking after the case, he said: ‘I have got to accept the court’s decision and do as they say. I will keep myself to myself and keep out of their way.'

The old man behind the counter reached for Greg's dollar with a noticeably shaky hand that looked as though it had held more cigarettes and booze than money in its lifetime. He took his coffee and walked up the stairs to the second floor. There were about fifty people standing in the hallway outside the courtroom making small talk. He recognized a few of them, but was in no mood to start a conversation. Only four more jurors and two alternates were needed. With a little luck, he would soon be sent on his way. The coffee tasted bitter, but he continued to sip on it anyway, just to occupy himself. After a few minutes, a woman walked out of the courtroom and spoke to the crowd in monotone. \\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We are ready to get started. We did not get enough jurors yesterday for the criminal trial, so we are going to use part of today's panel for that purpose. Those who are not selected for the criminal trial today must appear tomorrow at 8:00 AM for the civil trial jury selection. \\"First, I will call the names of the jurors that have already been selected. When I call your name, please go into the courtroom and take your seat in the pews where you sat yesterday.

The man's decision to brush his teeth with a toothbrush he found on the beach suggests that he may have an eccentric personality, or perhaps he is trying to find humor in the situation. As he walks along the beach, he would likely draw attention from others around him, including the woman in the bathroom. It is plausible that the woman has a connection to the toothbrush that the man picked up, possibly having dropped it earlier by accident. She may be leaving the bathroom after washing her hands or attending to her own personal needs. Upon exiting the bathroom, she would likely notice the man brushing his teeth with the toothbrush she lost. Initially, the woman might be surprised or even amused by the sight, which could lead to a conversation between the two individuals. It is realistic that the woman would approach the man to inquire about the toothbrush, unsure if she should be grossed out or laugh at the absurdity of the situation. Their interaction could be light-hearted and playful, as they both acknowledge the peculiarity of the event and perhaps share a chuckle over the coincidence. During their conversation, the man and woman might find that they share other interests or characteristics. The unique circumstances of their meeting could serve as a starting point for a deeper connection or friendship, as they both have demonstrated a willingness to engage with the unexpected. Additionally, the man's unusual behavior might prompt the woman to consider her own daily routines and habits, as she contemplates the role of spontaneity and impulse in her life. This newfound connection could encourage them both to explore new perspectives and find more joy in novelty, opening up new possibilities for personal growth and bonding over shared experiences.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: No matter how much guidance the assignment provides, an integral part of nearly any research project is allowing each researcher to come up with their own idea. You need to identify a problem in your chosen field that needs to be solved or answer a question that has not yet been answered.  At this stage, a pen and piece of paper are your best friends. Without worrying about structure or format, start writing down ideas – anything you're interested in, really, as long as it falls within the bounds of the assigned project's guidelines. At this stage its worth remembering that the more interest you have in a given topic, the easier it will be to push through any obstacles that may crop up when trying to complete the project. Don't hesitate while writing down ideas. You'll end up with some mental noise on the paper – silly or nonsensical phrases that your brain just pushes out. That's fine. Think of it as sweeping the cobwebs out of your attic. After a minute or two, better ideas will begin to form (and you might have a nice little laugh at your own expense in the meantime). If you just can't seem to brainstorm anything very interesting, and you've been given a vague and unhelpful prompt, your next best bet is to review a textbook or lecture notes. Skim over them and look for subjects you found interesting. You can even flip open a textbook to the index, pick an interesting-sounding term or name, and go from there. Another extremely useful tool is a journal. These are periodicals collecting research in a specific field. So if for example, you were looking for a topic in radiology, you may want to look at a few issues of Radiology- the journal of the American College of Radiology. If you are doing this in partial fulfillment of a university course or honors degree programme, it's worth checking out what research topics were covered by other students over previous years. Sometimes you may be lucky enough to find ready-made suggestions at the end of the project which the author has made in their recommendations for further research. You may also be able to change the topic slightly to come up with a new project. This has the advantage of providing a ready-made, tried and tested, robust methodology for your project. Some instructors will even provide samples of previously successful topics if you ask for them. Just be careful that you don't end up stuck with an idea you want to do, but are afraid to do because you know someone else did it before. If you have at least a little direction based on the project guidelines, take that basic direction and start turning it over and over in your mind.  Write down everything you come up with on paper, even if it doesn't seem viable. Start with obvious approaches, and then try to think about other questions that are indirectly related to the main thrust of your guidelines. Keep adding items until you can't think of any more. For example, if your research topic is “urban poverty,” you could look at that topic across ethnic or sexual lines, but you could also look into corporate wages, minimum wage laws, the cost of medical benefits, the loss of unskilled jobs in the urban core, and on and on. You could also try comparing and contrasting urban poverty with suburban or rural poverty, and examine things that might be different about both areas, such as diet and exercise levels, or air pollution. You can combine a few or several different parameters to create concrete questions that will give your research some direction. Continuing with the previous example, you might look at the dietary habits of the rural poor with the urban poor, cross-checking against the habits of well-to-do people to get an idea of whether a diet is influenced more by money or environment, and to what extent. how are you going to collect data. Methodology (is the meat of the project and you don't want to commit to a topic which will not have a feasible methodology or one that may require funding beyond your means  (this is specifically aimed at undergraduates with limited resources (poor students lacking both time and money!) who are likely going to have to self fund their projects) . This may appear to be jumping the gun a bit, but you'll be glad you didn't waste time on projects that you could not have completed on time. Think in terms of questions you want answered. A good research project should collect information for the purpose of answering (or at least attempting to answer) a question. As you review and interconnect topics, you'll think of questions that don't seem to have clear answers yet. These questions are your research topics. Now that you have a handful of concrete research ideas that interest you, take your favorite and do a little preliminary research. If you're finding the information you might be able to use, stick with that topic; if there seems to be no useful research at all, you'll either have to perform original research or change topics. Don't be afraid to take a gamble if there is research but it seems a bit thin – often, those are the areas where more attention is sorely needed, and your paper will draw some attention in the right direction if nothing else.  Don't limit yourself to libraries and online databases. Think in terms of outside resources as well: primary sources, government agencies, even educational TV programs. If you want to know about differences in animal population between public land and an Indian reservation, call the reservation and see if you can speak to their department of fish and wildlife. If you're planning to go ahead with original research, that's great – but those techniques aren't covered in this article. Instead, speak with qualified advisors and work with them to set up a thorough, controlled, repeatable process for gathering information. Now that you've narrowed the field and chosen a research question to pursue, it's time to get a bit more formal. Write down your research question, and then briefly note the steps you plan to take to get it answered. Finally, at the bottom of the page, write down each possible answer to the topic question. There are usually three potential answers: it's one way, it's the other way, or it doesn't seem to make any difference. If your plan comes down to “researching the topic,” and there aren't any more specific things you can say about it, write down the types of sources you plan to use instead: books (library or private?), magazines (which ones?), interviews, and so on. Your preliminary research should have given you a solid idea of where to begin. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the importance of brainstorming and selecting a research topic, offering various techniques such as writing down ideas, reviewing textbooks, exploring journals, and considering previous research topics.

News article: An airline employee stole an empty passenger plane from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Friday night and performed dangerous maneuvers in the sky before crashing on a nearby island about an hour later, killing him, officials said.      The man was identified by a senior federal aviation source as Richard Russell, whom authorities described as a 29-year-old resident of Pierce County in Washington state and an Horizon Air ground services worker.      The incident began when an Horizon Air turboprop plane took off from the runway at 7:32 p.m. local time Friday, with the man identified as Russell behind the controls and no one else on board, officials said. The 76-seat airliner was captured on video doing giant loops in the air and other risky stunts during its hour-long flight.      North American Aerospace Defense Command quickly launched two F-15 fighter jets to pursue the rogue aircraft, a federal senior aviation source told ABC News. Meanwhile, air traffic controllers \\"communicated with the individual who was flying the aircraft to try to help him land safely,\\" the Federal Aviation Administration said.      An hour after the unauthorized takeoff, the plane crashed on Ketron Island, a small, sparsely populated island about 40 miles away from the airport. The fighter jets were not involved in the crash, officials said.      Aerial footage of Ketron Island showed a large fiery blaze where the plane went down. No one on the ground was harmed and no buildings were damaged, officials said.      Seattle-Tacoma International Airport flights were delayed or diverted Friday night due to the incident, with normal operations resuming by around 1 a.m., officials said.      \\"This might have been a joyride gone terribly wrong,\\" said Pierce County Sheriff Paul Pastor.      John Wauldron/AFP/Getty Images      'We don't know how he learned to do that'      Airline officials are unsure how Russell learned to operate a plane, much less perform flying stunts. There are many switches and levers to even start a plane, Horizon Air CEO Gary Beck told reporters at a news conference Saturday.      \\"We don’t know how he learned to do that.\\" Beck said, adding that the man did perform some \\"incredible\\" maneuvers. \\"To our knowledge he did not have a pilot's license.\\"      The man was authorized to be in the area of the airfield where the plane was parked for maintenance, officials said.      Beck said he and Brad Tilden, the CEO of Alaska Airlines, the parent company of Horizon Air, are working closely with the FBI, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration to better understand the circumstances of the unauthorized flight.      The FBI said it is leading an investigation into the incident, including interviewing the Russell's family and coworkers.      Debra Eckrote, the Western Pacific regional chief for the National Transportation Safety Board, said investigators are searching through the plane wreckage to retrieve the flight data recorder, which could help determine a motive.      KOMO      'I don't want to hurt no one'      Audio recordings of the Russell's exchange with air traffic controllers were posted on Broadcastify and confirmed by federal aviation sources as authentic. In the recordings, air traffic controllers can be heard trying to persuade him to land the plane and help him do so safely. They also had experienced pilots radio in to guide him on flying.      \\"I just kind of want to do a couple maneuvers to see what it can do before I put it down,\\" Russell tells air traffic control.      \\"This is probably like jail time for life, huh? I would hope it is for a guy like me,\\" he says a few minutes later.      \\"We're not going to worry or think about that, but could you start a left-hand turn please?\\" an air traffic controller responds.      \\"I don't want to hurt no one,\\" Russell says.

The plane, which was taken from a maintenance position and was not scheduled for passenger flight, crashed about an hour later in a wooded area on Ketron Island in rural Pierce County. No ground structures were involved at the crash site.      Military jets were scrambled from Portland, but it does not appear that these jets were involved in the crash of the Horizon aircraft.      This individual who took the aircraft, who has not yet been positively identified until remains are examined, is believed to have been the only person on the plane when the plane was taken from a maintenance position at Sea-Tac.

The Horizon Air employee who commandeered an empty turboprop passenger plane at Seattle’s main airport Friday night, flying it over Puget Sound before crashing it into a small island, has been identified as Richard Russell, authorities said.      This story will be updated.      A Horizon Air employee described as “suicidal” commandeered an empty turboprop passenger plane at Seattle’s main airport Friday night and roared low over Puget Sound — with a pair of Air Force F-15s in pursuit — before crashing it into a small island, authorities said.      The FBI’s Seattle field office on Friday said early signs do not point toward terrorism. Pierce County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Ed Troyer described the suspect as an unnamed suicidal 29-year-old man from the county “doing stunts in the air” before the crash.      The man, referred to as “Rich” and “Richard” by air traffic controllers in tense recordings, said he was “just a broken guy” as authorities tried to divert the 76-seat Bombardier Q400 away from populated areas.      He took off with the stolen aircraft at about 8 p.m. Friday from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and was an employee of Horizon Air, the Alaska Air Group said in a statement.      The aircraft slammed into Ketron Island about an hour later, authorities said, triggering an intense blaze. The wooded island, about 25 miles southwest from the airport, has a population of about 20 people, the Seattle Times reported, and is accessible only by ferry.      Pierce County Sheriff Paul Pastor called it a “joyride gone terribly wrong.” He said it appears that the man died in the crash and that there were no injuries on the ground, according to the Times. The FBI is leading the investigation, authorities said Saturday.      The man was a ground service agent with more than three years of experience. Those agents guide planes, handle bags and de-ice planes, Horizon Air says. Mike Ehl, the director of operations at SeaTac, told reporters Saturday the man used a tractor to spin the plane 180 degrees so he could taxi to the runway.      Investigators have not disclosed how the man was able to steal the plane and take it aloft, but the suicidal state evident in his radio exchanges is likely to revive the debate about background checks for aviation employees with access to secure areas, analysts say.      The United States has about 900,000 aviation workers, according to the most recent federal data, and the screening procedures they are subjected to are “pretty rudimentary,” said Mary Schiavo, the former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation.      While pilots undergo periodic medical exams, she said, airline mechanics and ground crew members are checked on a much more limited basis that does not include mental health exams.      The incident has also raised questions about the physical security of the planes. Though aircraft mechanics have broad access and routinely taxi planes along the tarmac, crew members are not supposed to be allowed inside the cockpit.      But Schiavo said those security procedures are not always observed, especially for smaller aircraft such as the Q400. “It can be a little more casual and a little loosey-goosey, especially if they are doing overnight maintenance,” said Schiavo, a former pilot and aviation professor.      A video posted to social media shows the aircraft flying loops as the F-15s flew in pursuit. The aircraft nose-dives toward the water before pulling up, flying low and sending locals into a panic.      (The video below has explicit language.)

FULL STORY: https://t.co/lttJfIjmIC            (Video: Skylar Jacboson) pic.twitter.com/0UL7Dkk42V — KOMO News (@komonews) August 11, 2018      Two F-15s were scrambled and in the air within minutes of the theft, flying at supersonic speeds from their Portland Air Force base to intercept the aircraft, said the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which oversees airspace protection in North America.      The jets were armed but did not fire on the aircraft, Air Force Capt. Cameron Hillier, a NORAD spokesman, told The Washington Post on Saturday. They attempted to divert the aircraft toward the Pacific Ocean while maintaining radio communication with controllers and Rich. The jets flew close enough to make visual contact, he said.      The incident fell under the ongoing mission of Noble Eagle, the air-defense mission launched after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hillier said. There have been 1,800 intercepts of nonmilitary aircraft since, according to NORAD’s statement.      Communication between Rich and air traffic controllers revealed a conversation between authorities and Rich, who boisterously says he fueled the plane “to go check out the Olympics [mountains].”      Rich detailed his experience flying from video games and asked for the coordinates to the killer whale shepherding her dead calf through Washington coastal waters for nearly three weeks.      “You know, the mama orca with the baby. I want to go see that guy,” Rich explains, according to audio obtained by Canadian journalist Jimmy Thomson.            An F-15 Eagle in Oregon earlier this year. (U.S. Air Force)      At one point, an air traffic controller advises he should land at the airfield of the nearby military base, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the Times reported.      “Oh man,” Rich says, “Those guys will rough me up if I try and land there. I think I might mess something up there, too. I wouldn’t want to do that. They probably have antiaircraft.”      The air-traffic control says they don’t have those weapons.      “We’re just trying to find a place for you to land safely,” he says.      Rich replies: “I’m not quite ready to bring it down just yet . . . But holy smokes, I got to stop looking at the fuel, because it’s going down quick.”      He explains he had not expected to expend fuel so quickly, as he thinks about what comes next. “This is probably jail time for life, huh?” he says. “I would hope it is for a guy like me.”      At one point, Rich appears to believe he will not live through the moment.      “I’ve got a lot of people that care about me. It’s going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it until now.”      The last known transmission was from about 8:47 p.m., the Times reported.      “I feel like one of my engines is going out or something,” Rich says, according to audio posted by aviation journalist Jon Ostrower at the Air Current website.      The controller responds: “Okay, Rich . . . “If you could, you just want to keep that plane right over the water. Keep the aircraft nice and low.”            A Horizon Air Bombardier Q400 takes off on Saturday from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. (Stephen Brashear/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)      The incident prompted authorities to temporarily ground flights at SeaTac. Flights resumed by about 9:3o p.m., the airport said in a statement.      Royal King, a Seattle-area resident in the area to photograph a wedding, was near the island when the plane cratered into the island, the Times reported.      “It was unfathomable; it was something out of a movie,” he said. “The smoke lingered. You could still hear the F-15s, which were flying low.”      Richard Bloom, an aviation security expert at Arizona’s Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University at Prescott, said he wasn’t aware of another incident in which a ground crew member managed to heist an airplane. Incidents of aviation workers attempting “inside jobs” that benefit extremists or drug traffickers are far more common.      1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The scene as an airline employee steals empty plane at Seattle airport then crashes it on a Puget Sound island View Photos An apparently suicidal mechanic stole an empty passenger plane from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and took it for a brief flight, then crashed it into the sparsely populated Ketron Island, Wash., in an incident officials said was unrelated to terrorism.

HANDOUT Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      A screening system to evaluate the mental health of aviation workers would be difficult, Bloom cautioned. “There are such significant challenges to preventing inappropriate security behavior,” he said. “It’s kind of surprising that these types of things don’t happen more often.”      A bipartisan House bill approved last year, 409 to 0, would tighten employee background checks and increase surveillance of secure areas at airports. But a Senate version of the bill has not advanced to a vote.      The House bill followed a February 2017 House Homeland Security Committee report warning of vulnerabilities to terrorists and criminals seeking to land jobs as aviation workers. Concerns over mental health were not a major focus of the inquiry.      But concern about the mental state of aviation workers has grown in recent years, analyst say, particularly after the 2015 crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 in France, when a co-pilot deliberately steered his plane into a mountainside, killing 144 passengers and five crew members.      The co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, had been treated for depression and psychiatric problems, but he had concealed the information from his employer. Once the flight was airborne, Lubitz locked his more senior pilot out of the cockpit and set the plane on its fatal course.      Devlin Barrett contributed to this report.

He was right in saying that there are so many people who have loved him.\\"      Russell, a Horizon Air ground service agent for three and a half years, was the only person aboard the plane, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department said. The job of a ground service agent includes directing aircraft for takeoff and gate approach, handling baggage and tidying and de-icing planes, authorities said.      The incident, which the FBI's Seattle office did not consider terrorism, raises questions about airport security. Investigators headed Saturday to the crash site to recover the plane's data recorders and Russell's remains as part of a criminal probe, authorities said.      Russell, who was not a pilot, at the controls, officials said. The 76-seat Horizon Air turboprop plane took off without authorization at 7:32 p.m. local time Friday, withRussell, who was not a pilot, at the controls, officials said.      After Russell talked periodically with air traffic controllers for about an hour, the plane crashed at Ketron Island,officials said.

MUST WATCH Hear audio from before plane crashed 01:12      Video from a witness on the ground shows the plane at one point pulling up for a loop, putting the aircraft upside-down and then pulling back up just feet above a body of water.      Airports nationwide will now look at whether their security procedures need to change, CNN safety analyst David Soucie said. For one, Russell shouldn't have been able to board the plane alone, he said.      \\"There is a protocol to not allow anyone singularly to get onboard an aircraft,\\" Soucie said. \\"If you're going to access the aircraft ... you make sure that you check with someone else, and that someone else (will confirm) that ... you have the right authority to get onto that aircraft.\\"      Latest developments      Airline and Seattle airport officials revealed the following at a news conference Saturday:      -- Russell was credentialed to be in secure areas at the airport, said Brad Tilden, CEO of Alaska Air Group, which owns Horizon Air.      -- He passed a series of background checks to gain his position, as he didn't have any criminal convictions.      -- Airline officials believe he was in uniform and worked a shift Friday, Tilden said.      -- The plane had been parked in a maintenance area and was not scheduled for a passenger flight, Tilden said.      -- He had no purpose to be at that plane Friday evening \\"other than ... what he did do,\\" Tilden said.      -- Besides his other duties, he was qualified to tow aircraft, said Gary Beck, Horizon Air's president and chief executive officer.      -- Officials don't believe Russell had a pilot's license, and they don't know how he knew to fly the plane.      'I would like to apologize ... got a few screws loose'      In audio recordings of the incident posted on Broadcastify, Russell can be heard talking to air traffic controllers as they try to guide him to land the plane.      At one point, he apologizes and says he is a \\"broken guy\\" with \\"a few screws loose.\\"      \\"I've got a lot of people that care about me, and it's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this,\\" Russell says. \\"I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it until now.\\"      The sheriff's department described Russell as suicidal. It did not elaborate.      Earlier in the flight, Russell says: \\"This is probably, like, jail time for life, huh? I mean, I would hope it is, for a guy like me.\\"      \\"Well,\\" a controller responds, \\"we're not going to worry or think about that. But could you start a left-hand turn, please?\\"      Later, a controller discusses getting a pilot on the radio to help Russell control the aircraft.

Not long before the crash, a pilot who'd been helping controllers advise Russell appears to mention the maneuver.      \\"Congratulations. You did that. Now let's land that airplane safely and don't hurt anybody on the ground,\\" the helping pilot radios.      Russell responds: \\"Awwww-right. Ah, dammit. I don't know, man! I don't know! I don't want to. I was kinda hoping that was going to be it. You know?\\"      The plane eventually crashed on sparsely populated Ketron Island, starting a fire in the woods but injuring no one outside the plane. The fuselage was fragmented and appeared to be upside down, said Debra Eckrote, regional chief for the National Transportation Safety Board.      F-15 jets chased the plane      The plane was a Q400, a Bombardier turboprop plane, one of about 40 the airline has in its fleet.      Within minutes of the plane's takeoff, the military scrambled two armed F-15 jets from Oregon to follow it, according to local and airline authorities and two sources with knowledge of the situation. They pursued the aircraft before it went down on Ketron Island, between Tacoma and Olympia.      \\"NORAD fighters did not fire upon the aircraft,\\" North American Aerospace Defense Command said Saturday morning in a news release. The jets' capability was appropriate to the potential task, one of the sources said, without offering details.      F-15 \\"pilots kept plane out of harms way and people on ground safe,\\" the sheriff's office tweeted. The jets were not involved in the crash, it said.      The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, but the F-15s did not bring the plane down, Eckrote said.      @KING5Seattle here's a video of the hijacked plane and fighter escort from Steilacoom in the ferry line for anderson Island pic.twitter.com/8fgAUe05xv — Kai Simpson (@Kai_AHS) August 11, 2018      Witness thought it was an air show      Witnesses described the surreal scene after the plane left the airport. John Waldron was walking along a trail near the bay when he noticed the two military jets following a plane doing aerobatics.      \\"I thought they were practicing for an air show,\\" he said.      The plane was a Bombardier Q400, like this Horizon Air plane shown in May 2017. Horizon Air is a sister carrier to Alaska Airlines.      After the plane approached Ketron Island, Waldron saw a thick column of smoke followed by a loud explosion, he said.      \\"Everyone was literally frozen in place, muttering about what possibly happened,\\" he said.      Kathleen Reichel said she watched the planes pass by for about two minutes.      \\"My husband and I are recently former Boeing employees, and we were wondering why a jet was near the passenger airplane,\\" she said. \\"We heard the jet because our windows were down while we were waiting in the ferry line to go to Anderson Island, which is adjacent to Ketron Island.\\"      He had some flight skills, expert says      It wasn't immediately clear what training, if any, Russell had in flying planes.      A ground service agent's tasks don't involve touching planes' controls, CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said.      But the plane made turns and aerobatic maneuvers that suggest some skill, she said.      \\"In this plane, he certainly knew how to retract the landing gear, he coordinated both engines, powered them up to get a coordinated takeoff,\\" she said. \\"A couple of the turns, it looked like what we call in basic flight training a 'coordinated turn,' meaning that he not only used the yoke ... but you also coordinate with the rudders and you do the turns.      \\"Yeah, he knew how to fly,\\" she continued. \\"But ... the air traffic controller had to tell him how to set what they call the 'bugs' -- they're just little, sort of, little levers, or little notches on your indicator for your heading, ... which is kind of basic.      \\"So, (he) had some knowledge but clearly wasn't a commercial pilot.\\"      Federal agencies are investigating      \\"Our hearts are with the families of the individual aboard as well as all of our Alaska Air and Horizon Air employees,\\" said Constance von Muehlen, the airline's chief operating officer.      The FBI will lead the investigation, said Eckrote, the NTSB regional chief.      \\"The FBI is going to be thorough, which means taking the time needed to scour the area, delve into the background of the individual believed responsible for Friday night's incident, and review every aspect with all appropriate public and private partners,\\" the FBI's Seattle office tweeted Saturday afternoon.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

How is \\"Seadramon\\" said in Finnish?","output":"To translate a proper noun like \\"Seadramon\\" from English to Finnish, we first need to identify its meaning and see if there's a corresponding term in Finnish. 1. Analyzing the name \\"Seadramon\\": This is the name of a fictional creature from the Digimon franchise. It is a marine creature, and its name is a combination of \\"sea\\" (as in a large body of water) and \\"dramon,\\" a common suffix for Digimon names that is derived from \\"dragon.\\" 2. Checking for proper noun translation: In many cases, proper nouns tend to remain the same across different languages, especially for fictional characters or franchises. 3. Deciding on the translation: Since \\"Seadramon\\" is a name of a specific Digimon character, the proper noun likely won't have a direct Finnish translation. It would be best to keep the name as \\"Seadramon\\" to avoid any confusion with Finnish speakers familiar with the Digimon franchise. Therefore, \\"Seadramon\\" is said as \\"Seadramon\\" in Finnish since it's the name of a specific character and doesn't require a direct translation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that joined William Burges's office in the 1850's?  Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das Englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \\"the most talented Gothicist of his day\\". From the later twentieth century to the present a renaissance has occurred in the study of Victorian art, architecture and design and Crook contends that Burges's place at the centre of that world, as \\"a wide-ranging scholar, an intrepid traveller, a coruscating lecturer, a brilliant decorative designer and an architect of genius,\\" is again appreciated. Crook writes further that, in a career of only some twenty years, he became \\"the most brilliant architect-designer of his generation,\\" and, beyond architecture, his achievements in metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass place him as Pugin's only \\"rival [.] as the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival.\\" A:","output":"The full name of the person that joined William Burges's office in the 1850s is Richard Popplewell Pullan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time.

He killed himself when I was three years old, leaving mom with the job of raising nine kids. She was a very hard worker, and in order to make ends meet, she hardly ever rested. With my mom as my example, I learned that hard work is the best way to get what you want. Even as a little boy, I knew I was going to be successful. Regardless of what I chose, I wanted to make my brothers, sisters and mom proud of me--not only by being successful in what I chose to do, but also as a person who could be looked up to for the right reasons. Surprising as it might seem, basketball wasn't in my plans. One day, my mom cut a rim  off an old water barrel  and then held it up for me to throw an old rubber ball through. By junior high, I started playing basketball on a team. I loved to compete. For me, it paid off. I always put the effort in, every day. I am grateful for the life I've enjoyed as a basketball star.

The teen was in critical condition at Sacred Heart Medical Center , police said in a news release .","output":"Step 1: Read both sentences and identify the key differences - Sentence 1: The teen was in critical condition with life-threatening wounds, police said in a news release. - Sentence 2: The teen was in critical condition at Sacred Heart Medical Center, police said in a news release. Step 2: Identify the different information in each sentence - Sentence 1: \\"with life-threatening wounds\\" - Sentence 2: \\"at Sacred Heart Medical Center\\" Step 3: Compare the differences to see if they change the meaning of the sentences - The difference in both sentences is specifically related to the additional context given. Sentence 1 provides information about the severity of the wounds, while Sentence 2 provides information about the medical facility the teen is in. Step 4: Determine if the sentences have the same meaning - Although both sentences convey that the teen is in critical condition according to a police news release, they provide different details regarding the situation. Sentence 1 informs us that the teen has life-threatening wounds, while Sentence 2 tells us the location of the hospital where the teen is being treated.  Step 5: Conclusion - The two sentences do not have the same meaning because they provide different information about the teen's situation. They are, however, related and can be combined to provide a fuller picture of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The park service purchased the land from the estate of Samuel Mills Damon for  22 million . Choose your answer: are the two sentences saying the same thing? Choices: I. no. II. yes.","output":"I. No. While at a glance, the two sentences may appear to be saying the same thing – that the land from the estate of Samuel Mills Damon was purchased for 22 million – there is a subtle difference in the involvement of different organizations in the two scenarios. In the first sentence, \\"The conservancy helped in the purchase of the land from the Estate of Samuel Mills Damon for 22 million.\\" Here, it is clear that a conservancy had an active role in the acquisition of the land. The conservancy may have possibly provided funding, resources, or expertise to facilitate the transaction. However, the sentence does not explicitly state who the actual buyer of the land is, merely that the conservancy was somehow involved in the process or collaborated with another entity in the purchase. In contrast, the second sentence, \\"The park service purchased the land from the estate of Samuel Mills Damon for 22 million.\\" This sentence straightforwardly mentions that the park service was the organization that bought the land, without any mention of the involvement of a conservancy or other organizations in the transaction. The key difference between the two statements is the involvement of the conservancy in the first sentence, whereas the park service is the sole purchaser in the second sentence. Although both sentences mention the land's purchase from the estate of Samuel Mills Damon for 22 million, they do not convey identical information regarding the parties involved in the acquisition process.

The band James had on his arm put too much pressure on the arm because the  Available choices: 1). band is too big.. 2). arm is too big..","output":"band is too tight. Since the day James started playing sports, he has always been a fan of wearing arm bands. Not only did they help prevent sweat from dripping down his arms, but they also provided a sense of identity representing his dedication and love for the game. When he discovered a new stylish band in the local sports store, he was eager to try it on and incorporate it into his practice and game sessions. However, to his disappointment, the new band posed more of a problem than a solution. The band put too much pressure on his arm, causing discomfort and restrictiveness to normal blood flow. This situation arose not because the band was too big or the arm was too big, but because the band was too tight. Upon inspecting the band's fabric, James noticed that it was made of a less stretchy material than his previous ones, and the elastic properties were quite limited in comparison. As a result, his arm was unable to adapt to the tightness imposed by the band. Where his previous bands had dynamically adjusted to the size of his arm, this one offered little to no flexibility, ultimately culminating in a feeling of compression and pressure. Over time, James realized that the tightness of the band had further implications. It had the potential to cause pain and numbness in the arm as well as limit his range of motion while playing. It could lead to impaired physical performance and even pose a risk of injury due to the hindered circulation of blood in the affected area. James knew that he couldn't continue with his current band, and so he decided to search for an appropriate replacement. When looking for a suitable band, he kept in mind the lessons he'd learned. For starters, he focused on finding an arm band made of a flexible fabric that would comfortably conform to his arm's size while at the same time providing adequate support. Moreover, he paid attention to the stitch quality and the distribution of the material for more even tension throughout the band, thus ensuring even pressure on his arm. It was essential for James that the new band wouldn't compromise his arm's blood circulation or negatively affect his performance during sports activities. After much research and contemplation, James found an arm band that met his requirements. It was made of a moisture-wicking, stretchable material ensuring both comfort and function. In addition, it had a sleek design that blended well with his sportswear. The new band fulfilled its purpose without cutting off his circulation or causing any discomfort, and James was glad to have finally found a perfect fit. His experience taught him the importance of selecting the right sports accessories that cater to individual needs and accommodate an individual's specific physique. By paying attention to factors such as material, size, stitch quality, and design, one can significantly enhance their overall sporting experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products.

Google must move its mystery barge from a construction site on an island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay because the permits are not in order, a state official said Monday. The notice came after the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission investigated numerous complaints about the construction of the floating, four-story building, commission executive director Larry Goldzband said. The investigation found that neither the Treasure Island Development Authority nor the city of San Francisco had applied for required permits for the work to be done at the site. Barge out: A state agency says Google must move its mystery barge from a construction site on an island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay because the permits are not in order. Goldzband said Google can resolve the issue by moving the barge to one of the fully permitted construction facilities in the San Francisco Bay. 'It needs to move,' he said. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Preliminary planning documents submitted to the port last fall showed plans for Google to build an interactive space for people to learn about technology. Has to move: Google is erecting a four-story structure in the heart of the San Francisco Bay but is managing to conceal its purpose by constructing it on docked barges instead of on land, where city building permits and public plans are mandatory. Mystery buildings: The barge is one of three mysterious floating structures that have sparked online speculation. There are three secretive structures, two in San Francisco and one Portland, Maine. The documents ended months of speculation that the barge would be a party boat, data storage center or a store for Google to sell its Internet-connected glasses. Google has had little to say about the barge or another vessel off the East Coast. In November, the company issued a statement that said, 'Although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology.' Goldzband said the construction in San Francisco Bay was not authorized by the agency, and the Treasure Island Development Authority, which allowed the project, could face fines and enforcement proceedings. The disclosure by the California agency marked the second set of permit problems for the barge project. Late last year, work was halted after the Coast Guard said additional permits were needed.

News article: Plagiarism Is Not a Big Moral Deal During my tenure as the dean of a college, I determined that an underperforming program should be closed. My wife asked me if I had ever set foot on the premises, and when I answered “no,” she said that I really should do that before wielding the axe. And so I did, in the company of my senior associate dean. We toured the offices and spoke to students and staff. In the course of a conversation, one of the program’s co-directors pressed on me his latest book. I opened it to the concluding chapter, read the first two pages, and remarked to my associate dean, “This is really good.” But on the way back to the administration building, I suddenly flashed on the pages I admired and began to suspect that the reason I liked them so much was that I had written them. And sure enough, when I got back to my office and pulled one of my books off the shelf, there the pages were, practically word for word. I telephoned the co-director, and told him that I had been looking at his book, and wanted to talk about it. He replied eagerly that he would come right over, but when he came in I pointed him to the two books — his and mine — set out next to each other with the relevant passages outlined by a marker. He turned white and said that he and his co-author had divided the responsibilities for the book’s chapters and that he had not written (perhaps “written” should be in quotes) this one. I contacted the co-author and he wrote back to me something about graduate student researchers who had given him material that was not properly identified. I made a few half-hearted efforts to contact the book’s publisher, but I didn’t persist and I pretty much forgot about it, although the memory returns whenever I read yet another piece (like one that appeared recently in The Times) about the ubiquity of plagiarism, the failure of students to understand what it is, the suspicion that they know what it is but don’t care, and the outdatedness of notions like originality and single authorship on which the intelligibility of plagiarism as a concept depends. Whenever it comes up plagiarism is a hot button topic and essays about it tend to be philosophically and morally inflated. But there are really only two points to make. (1) Plagiarism is a learned sin. (2) Plagiarism is not a philosophical issue. Of course every sin is learned. Very young children do not distinguish between themselves and the world; they assume that everything belongs to them; only in time and through the conditioning of experience do they learn the distinction between mine and thine and so come to acquire the concept of stealing. The concept of plagiarism, however, is learned in more specialized contexts of practice entered into only by a few; it’s hard to get from the notion that you shouldn’t appropriate your neighbor’s car to the notion that you should not repeat his words without citing him. The rule that you not use words that were first uttered or written by another without due attribution is less like the rule against stealing, which is at least culturally universal, than it is like the rules of golf. I choose golf because its rules are so much more severe and therefore so much odder than the rules of other sports. In baseball you can (and should) steal bases and hide the ball. In football you can (and should) fake a pass or throw your opponent to the ground. In basketball you will be praised for obstructing an opposing player’s view of the court by waving your hands in front of his face. In hockey … well let’s not go there. But in golf, if you so much as move the ball accidentally while breathing on it far away from anyone who might have seen what you did, you must immediately report yourself and incur the penalty. (Think of what would happen to the base-runner called safe at home-plate who said to the umpire, “Excuse me, sir, but although you missed it, I failed to touch third base.”) Golf’s rules have been called arcane and it is not unusual to see play stopped while a P.G.A. official arrives with rule book in hand and pronounces in the manner of an I.R.S. official. Both fans and players are aware of how peculiar and “in-house” the rules are; knowledge of them is what links the members of a small community, and those outside the community (most people in the world) can be excused if they just don’t see what the fuss is about. Plagiarism is like that; it’s an insider’s obsession. If you’re a professional journalist, or an academic historian, or a philosopher, or a social scientist or a scientist, the game you play for a living is underwritten by the assumed value of originality and failure properly to credit the work of others is a big and obvious no-no. But if you’re a musician or a novelist, the boundary lines are less clear (although there certainly are some) and if you’re a politician it may not occur to you, as it did not at one time to Joe Biden, that you’re doing anything wrong when you appropriate the speech of a revered statesman. And if you’re a student, plagiarism will seem to be an annoying guild imposition without a persuasive rationale (who cares?); for students, learning the rules of plagiarism is worse than learning the irregular conjugations of a foreign language. It takes years, and while a knowledge of irregular verbs might conceivably come in handy if you travel, knowledge of what is and is not plagiarism in this or that professional practice is not something that will be of very much use to you unless you end up becoming a member of the profession yourself. It follows that students who never quite get the concept right are by and large not committing a crime; they are just failing to become acclimated to the conventions of the little insular world they have, often through no choice of their own, wandered into. It’s no big moral deal; which doesn’t mean, I hasten to add, that plagiarism shouldn’t be punished — if you’re in our house, you’ve got to play by our rules — just that what you’re punishing is a breach of disciplinary decorum, not a breach of the moral universe. Now if plagiarism is an idea that makes sense only in the precincts of certain specialized practices and is not a normative philosophical notion, inquiries into its philosophical underpinnings are of no practical interest or import. In recent years there have been a number of assaults on the notion of originality, issuing from fields as diverse as literary theory, history, cultural studies, philosophy, anthropology, Internet studies. Single authorship, we have been told, is a recent invention of a bourgeois culture obsessed with individualism, individual rights and the myth of progress. All texts are palimpsests of earlier texts; there’s been nothing new under the sun since Plato and Aristotle and they weren’t new either; everything belongs to everybody. In earlier periods works of art were produced in workshops by teams; the master artisan may have signed them, but they were communal products. In some cultures, even contemporary ones, the imitation of standard models is valued more than work that sets out to be path-breaking. (This was one of the positions in the famous quarrel between the ancients and the moderns in England and France in the 17th and 18th centuries.) Arguments like these (which I am reporting, not endorsing) have been so successful in academic circles that the very word “originality” often appears in quotation marks, and it has seemed to many that there is a direct path from this line of reasoning to the conclusion that plagiarism is an incoherent, even impossible, concept and that a writer or artist accused of plagiarism is being faulted for doing something that cannot be avoided. R.M. Howard makes the point succinctly “If there is no originality and no literary property, there is no basis for the notion of plagiarism” (“College English,” 1995). That might be true or at least plausible if, in order to have a basis, plagiarism would have to stand on some philosophical ground. But the ground plagiarism stands on is more mundane and firm; it is the ground of disciplinary practices and of the histories that have conferred on those practices a strong, even undoubted (though revisable) sense of what kind of work can be appropriately done and what kind of behavior cannot be tolerated. If it is wrong to plagiarize in some context of practice, it is not because the idea of originality has been affirmed by deep philosophical reasoning, but because the ensemble of activities that take place in the practice would be unintelligible if the possibility of being original were not presupposed. And if there should emerge a powerful philosophical argument saying there’s no such thing as originality, its emergence needn’t alter or even bother for a second a practice that can only get started if originality is assumed as a baseline. It may be (to offer another example), as I have argued elsewhere, that there’s no such thing as free speech, but if you want to have a free speech regime because you believe that it is essential to the maintenance of democracy, just forget what Stanley Fish said — after all it’s just a theoretical argument — and get down to it as lawyers and judges in fact do all the time without the benefit or hindrance of any metaphysical rap. Everyday disciplinary practices do not rest on a foundation of philosophy or theory; they rest on a foundation of themselves; no theory or philosophy can either prop them up or topple them. As long as the practice is ongoing and flourishing its conventions will command respect and allegiance and flouting them will have negative consequences. This brings me back to the (true) story I began with. Whether there is something called originality or not, the two scholars who began their concluding chapter by reproducing two of my pages are professionally culpable. They took something from me without asking and without acknowledgment, and they profited — if only in the currency of academic reputation — from work that I had done and signed. That’s the bottom line and no fancy philosophical argument can erase it. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article argues that plagiarism is not a major moral issue but rather a learned sin and an insider's obsession for specific professions and disciplines, such as academia, journalism, and certain sciences. The author states that understanding and abiding by plagiarism rules primarily matters within these specialized contexts where originality and proper attribution hold great value. However, in other fields like music, novels, and politics, the boundary lines may be less clear, and individuals in these fields may not view plagiarism as seriously. The author also highlights that plagiarism need not be rooted in deep philosophical arguments about originality or intellectual property. Instead, it should be seen in the context of disciplinary practices and the history behind them. Each discipline develops its conventions, and as long as these conventions are respected and followed, the practice thrives. Therefore, flouting these conventions comes with negative consequences within that discipline, irrespective of any philosophical argument. In summary, the most important parts of the news article are: 1. Plagiarism is not a big moral deal but a learned sin and an insider's obsession for certain professional fields. 2. Plagiarism rules should be understood and followed within specialized contexts. 3. The concept of plagiarism need not rely on philosophical arguments but should be viewed in the light of disciplinary practices and history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Which of the two friaries was founded first?  The chapter ordered that 13 canons, including the succentor and the archdeacon, should immediately \\"erect, construct, build, and duly repair their manses, and the enclosures of their gardens within the college of Moray\\". The manse of the precentor, erroneously called the Bishop's House, is partially ruined and is dated 1557. (Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.The hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.There were two friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563. In 1489, the chapter founded a...

Throughout its history Lower Silesia has been under the control of the medieval Kingdom of Poland, the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy from 1526. In 1742 nearly all of the region was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and became part of the German Empire in 1871, except for a small part which formed the southern part of the Lower Silesian Duchy of Nysa and had been incorporated into Austrian Silesia in 1742. After 1945 the main part of the former Prussian Province of Lower Silesia fell to the Republic of Poland, while a smaller part west of the Oder-Neisse line remained within East Germany and historical parts of Austrian Lower Silesia  remained as a part of Czechoslovakia.

The long strait divides the island of Karmøy on the west and the mainland of Norway and island of Vestre Bokn in the east. The strait runs through the municipalities of Haugesund, Karmøy, and Bokn. The town of Haugesund lies at the northern end of the strait and the town of Kopervik lies in the central part of the strait, and the village of Skudeneshavn lies near the southern end where the strait flows into the Boknafjorden. The Karmsund Bridge, a part of the European route E134 highway, links Karmøy to the mainland. The bridge was completed in 1955. The small islands of Vibrandsøy, Risøy, and Hasseløy lie in the strait at the northern end, just off shore from the town of Haugesund.  - Avaldsnes is a village in Karmøy municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The village is located on the northeastern part of the island of Karmøy, along the Karmsundet strait, just south of the town of Haugesund. The village was an ancient centre of power on the west coast of Norway and is the site of one of Norways more important areas of cultural history. The trading port of Notow and the Avaldsnes Church are two notable historic sites in Avaldsnes.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - Location. The town is situated on a strategically important sound, the Karmsundet, through which ships could pass without traversing heavy seas. In the early years, the coastal waters off Haugesund were a huge source of herring, and the town grew accordingly. Despite being barely a village back then, King Harald Fairhair lived at Avaldsnes, very close to the modern town of Haugesund. In the last decades, the town, like its neighbours, has been turning towards the petroleum industry, with the herring being long gone.  - Harald Fairhair (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Hárfagri\\", Norwegian: \\"Harald Hårfagre\\", (literally \\"Harald Hair-fair\\") ;  850   932) is remembered by medieval historians as the first King of Norway. According to traditions current in Norway and Iceland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, he reigned from  872 to 930. Most of his life remains uncertain, since the extant accounts of his life in the sagas were set down in writing around three centuries after his lifetime. A few remnants of skaldic praise poems attributed to contemporary court poets exist which seem to refer to Harald's victories against opponents in Norway. The information supplied in these poems is inconsistent with the tales in the sagas in which they are transmitted, and the sagas themselves often disagree on the details of his background and biography. Two of his sons, Eric Bloodaxe and Haakon the Good, succeeded Harald to become kings after his death.  - Fotballklubben Haugesund is a Norwegian football club from the city of Haugesund .

Look for any gaps or weak areas that you see right away. Check to see if you have at least one item listed in all of the following key areas: experience, education, skills, volunteer work.","output":"To boost your resume and make it stand out to potential employers, follow these steps: 1. Customize your resume for each job application: Tailor your resume to match the specific requirements and desired skills mentioned in each job posting. Use the keywords from the job description to highlight your relevant experience and qualifications. This will help your resume get past applicant tracking systems (ATS) and catch the attention of hiring managers. 2. Quantify your achievements: Use numbers, statistics, and percentages to showcase the impact of your work. This helps to demonstrate your effectiveness and makes your accomplishments more tangible to potential employers. For example, instead of saying \\"increased sales,\\" mention \\"increased sales by 20% over six months.\\" 3. Focus on your accomplishments, not just responsibilities: Instead of merely listing your job duties, showcase the positive results of your work and how it contributed to the success of the company or team. Use action verbs to describe how you achieved these accomplishments. 4. Update your skillsets: Stay current with industry trends and developments by participating in professional development opportunities, such as workshops, webinars, and conferences. Include the newly acquired skills, software, or certifications to demonstrate your commitment to growth and learning. 5. Write a strong professional summary: This is the section at the top of your resume that briefly highlights your most relevant skills, accomplishments, and experience. A well-crafted professional summary can pique the interest of the hiring manager and persuade them to read the rest of your resume. 6. Optimize the format and layout: Use a clean, easy-to-read font and format, with clear headings and bullet points to organize your information. Avoid long paragraphs and aim for a concise yet comprehensive resume. Limit your resume to two pages or less, if possible. 7. Include relevant volunteer work, internships, or extracurricular activities: These experiences can help fill gaps in work experience and demonstrate transferable skills that are relevant for the job you are applying for, especially if you are a recent graduate or changing careers. 8. Highlight your soft skills: Employers often value soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving, just as much as hard skills. Showcase examples of how these skills have been put to use in your previous roles or experiences. 9. Edit and proofread your resume: Ensuring your resume is free from grammatical errors and typos shows your attention to detail. Ask a friend or family member to review your resume for additional feedback. 10. Consider professional resume writing services: If you are struggling to create an effective resume, consider enlisting the help of a professional resume writer. They can help you craft a polished and compelling resume that highlights your unique strengths and skills. By following these steps, you can optimize your resume and increase your chances of landing interviews and receiving job offers. Remember that your resume is a living document – continually update and refine it as you gain new experiences and skills throughout your career."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I cannot believe that the Indian film industry still puts out such third-rate dross as Waqt. For starters, the storyline is totally implausible  spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges (I honestly am not joking here). In the meantime, his dad is dying of lung cancer, but keeps it a secret from the son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands. The acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess  no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world. To be honest, the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film. The actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be revered as Gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative.

Just for kids, I had to continue to live and work as small-town doctor at my medical clinic in Hawaii. My kids had gone to live on the mainland, and I was alone. Then they asked me to have a family trip. On our trip, we turned on the TV at the motel and saw the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. Seeing it falling down, I said to my kids: \\"I'm going to Afghanistan\\". And a few weeks later, international Medical Corps sent me to set up 20 clinics in provinces where people had no health care. In these field clinics surrounded by frightening shoots or deadly bombs, we were eventually serving 27,000 patients a month in a very busy schedule. Tired and nervous, I gradually had a sense of achievement, a sense of purpose, and my depression went away. In the years to follow, I went to Indonesia after the tsunami, Pakistan after the earthquakes, Sudan after the civil warm and Iraq after more and more bombs. Each time after disasters one after another, hundreds of people were killed, wounded and many more had to flee. We once set up movable clinics in an area with 19,000  _ , and it was supposed to hold 13,000 originally. Flu broke out, one of the biggest killers of kids in refugee camps, and it spread like wildfire. Water and food were also serious problems. \\"Adventures or not?\\" I often asked myself. When my wife passed away, I thought my life was done. But in reality, it was just getting started. At the end of her life, she went unconscious. I held her head in my hands and told her of all the places we would visit and the exciting adventures we would have.  I think about the moment many times during my \\"adventures\\". I didn't know how predictive those words would be.But I know that she is still with me. How would the doctor describe his life after he had worked in Afghanistan? A) Tired and troublesome.

Here is a goal: To take raw ginger to shreds, you can Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"Here are two ways to shred raw ginger: Method 1: Grating 1. Gather: Select a clean piece of raw ginger root, get a proper grater, and prepare a clean surface or container to catch the ginger shreds. 2. Peel: Carefully peel the skin off the ginger using a knife or a vegetable peeler. This ensures that the outer skin does not mix with the shreds. 3. Grate: Hold the grater firmly and horizontally over the surface or container. Rub the peeled ginger back and forth against the grater's smallest holes to produce fine shreds. 4. Clean up: Detach the ginger shreds from the grater and gather them in a container. Rinse the grater to remove any ginger remnants. Method 2: Using a knife 1. Gather: Select a clean piece of ginger root, get a sharp knife, and prepare a clean cutting board. 2. Peel: Carefully peel the skin off the ginger using a knife or a vegetable peeler. This ensures that the outer skin does not mix with the shreds. 3. Slice: Place the ginger on the cutting board and slice it into thin coin-shaped pieces. The thinner the slices, the easier it will be to shred later. 4. Stack and shred: Stack several slices on top of each other and cut them into thin strips. Hold the stack steady with one hand, and use the knife to make fine shreds. 5. Clean up: Gather the ginger shreds in a container and clean the cutting board and knife. Both methods can help you achieve the goal of shredding raw ginger, but the best method depends on personal preference. Method 1 (using a grater) is an easier and faster way to shred ginger, producing uniform shreds. Method 2 (using a knife) provides more control over the size of the shreds and does not require a grater.

Its garbage collector and focus on efficient, \\"close to the metal\\" operations make it a strong choice for high-performance applications. 4. Ecosystem: While not as extensive as some other programming languages, the Go ecosystem is rapidly growing. The standard library provides a broad range of functionality, and there are high-quality libraries available for various tasks like web development, database access, distributed systems, and more. 5. Job market and industry adoption: Go is becoming increasingly popular among tech companies, especially for backend and systems development. Companies like Google, Dropbox, Uber, and Netflix have adopted the language, which has resulted in an increasing demand for Go developers. 6. Community support: Go has a strong and growing community. There are many resources available for learning, such as online tutorials, blogs, forums, and even a free interactive online course from the official Go website. 7.

Another student told me about great websites about learning History and English. The Buddy Club is also a good place to just forget about school altogether! One of the older students taught us origami  . We made paper planes, birds and hats together. The table tennis tournament  was a great idea.

They have described themselves as the 'Spice Girls' of their day - the 'lily white' Maids of Honour chosen to accompany the Queen on her Coronation Day. Lady Rosemary Spencer-Churchill, Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Lady Anne Coke, Lady Mary Baillie-Hamilton, Lady Moyra Hamilton and Lady Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby were chosen for their 'decorative' beauty as well as their ability to carry the Queen's heavy train. All six were reunited at Westminster Abbey today to celebrate sixty years since that momentous day. The Queen on her Coronation Day in 1953, accompanied by the six women who now call themselves 'The Queen's Spice Girls' According to Lady Anne Glenconner - then lady Anne Coke -  behind the pomp, preparations for one of the most iconic events in modern history were a joyfully chaotic affair. The then 20-year-old daughter of the Earl of Leicester, was a vivacious socialite who described the Maids as the 'Spice Girls of our day' and explained each were chosen because of their lineage - the girls had to be the daughter of an Earl, Marquess or Duke - and be unmarried. 'We also had to have a certain type of look and figure. Put it this way, we wouldn't have got picked if we were fat!' she laughed. According to Lady Glenconner there was barely any time to rehearse - and never in the Abbey itself. 'We had a few run-throughs with the Duchess of Norfolk, who actually walked quite differently from the Queen - she walked much faster and we had to really pick up our pace in a hurry when we got to the Abbey. In the end we had just one rehearsal with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, where she wore some kind of curtain wrapped around her waist to mimic her heavy robes,' she recalled. Lady Anne Glenconner, left, and Lady Jane Rayne, right, arrives at Westminster Abbey today for a service to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the Coronation Service. The night before the Coronation - which was held on June 2 1953 - the capital was so packed that Lady Glenconner had to sleep on a mattress on her great-uncle's floor. 'I don't think many people would have imagined that,' she said. She added: 'On the morning we had our hair and make-up done because the event was being televised for the first time, but my hair was a disaster. 'I had just had a perm done and they put these heated rollers in my hair. I was frazzled and looked like a sheep and was awfully upset. Fortunately the hairdresser got to work and made me look half decent. 'We dressed at Buckingham Palace. Like the Queen our dresses were by Normal Hartnell, but while they looked exquisite they were the most horribly uncomfortable things to wear and absolutely crushed our ribs. We were told to keep wriggling out toes to try and keep the circulation going.' Lady Rosemary Muir, left, and Lady Mary Russell and Lady Jane Willoughby, right, entering Westminster Abbey. Lady Moyra Campbell was one of the Queen's maids of honour at the 1953 Coronation. Four of the more junior maids, including Lady Glenconner, headed to Westminster Abbey head of the Queen's arrival in the Gold State Coach. 'It was so exciting and we could hear the crowd roaring as the Queen approached. As she alighted we helped her out and smoothed her train. It was really quite cumbersome but had six invisible silk handles stitched into it. 'I must say she looked quite ravishing, the dress was just beautiful. She had such a tiny little waist, wonderful porcelain skin and bright, sparkling eyes. 'She turned to us and said: \\"Ready, girls?\\" and with that we were off. We were all a bag of nerves, but she was so calm it made us realised everything would be fine. 'Inside it was so spectacular, the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The colours, the music were just wonderful. Remember we girls had lived through the war, which was just so gloomy. Then we were suddenly transported into this wonderful tapestry that had come to life. 'Unfortunately half way through the service my dress was so tight that I began to faint. Black Rod [a senior officer in the House of Lords] was standing next to me and saw my legs buckle slightly, so held me up. We had smelling salt sewn into our gloves and I crushed my vial and wiggled my feet in an attempt to stay awake. 'Fortunately during the recess the Archbishop of Canterbury came up and offered me a nip of brandy from a flask he had hidden in the Abbey. That did the trick.' Britain's Queen Elizabeth returned to the scene of her Coronation today to mark a reign that has weathered six decades of social transformation and the end of her country's global empire. Unlike the pomp and circumstance of the Coronation itself, the reception at Buckingham palace was most definitely a family affair, with the young Prince Charles and Princess Anne running around and hiding under their mother's voluminous dress. 'When people ask you what the best moment of your life was, most say their wedding day. Of course I remember that too. But the Coronation was something exceedingly special. I was so lucky to be a part of it…..the roars, the excitement,' she said. 'After I had stood on the balcony with the Queen I went down to the crowds and listened to them calling for her. There were so many people, you couldn't squeeze a pin between them.' And later that night there was another, far less decorous celebration. 'My uncle had been asked to chaperone some of the visiting sheiks and I went out to nightclub with them until the early hours!' she recalled. The 60th anniversary ceremony remembering the Queen's 1953 Coronation was held in Westminster Abbey today and attended by all six maids of honour. Asked what she thinks the secret to the Queen's six remarkable decades on the throne is, Lady Glenconner, now 79, who went on to marry Colin Tennant, the 3rd Baron Glenconner, sums it up in one word: duty. 'I often discussed it with her sister, Princess Margaret, for whom I became a lady-in-waiting, and she told me that was what they were brought up to expect. The Queen was raised to give her life to her country,' she said. She continued: 'The Queen has behaved impeccably over the years and I think people realise that. 'She is actually a very modest  person to be around and I think the celebrations this year and those to come have made people realise what a tremendous debt of thanks we owe her as a nation. 'I remember very distinctly watching her in the Abbey as she was being anointed, she had stripped off her regalia and stood there in her simple white shift. It made her look very vulnerable, a young woman with the weight of her world on her shoulders. 'Then the years of training kicked in. I feel thrilled 60 years later to have played a small part in that remarkable day.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

His crime: feeding Fort Lauderdale's homeless. Abbott and two pastors, Dwayne Black and Mark Sims, were cited for disobeying a new city ordinance that effectively bans public food sharing, which could lead to 60 days in jail and a 500 fine for each, Local 10 reports. Abbott, who runs the nonprofit Love Thy Neighbor and has been feeding the homeless for more than 20 years, had served up just a handful of meals in Stranahan Park when he was stopped, the Sun-Sentinel reports. \\"I'm going to have to go to court again and sue the city of Fort Lauderdale,\\" he tells Local 10. \\"These are the poorest of the poor, they have nothing. ... How do you turn them away?\\" By \\"go to court again,\\" Abbott refers to a 1999 lawsuit—which he won—that he brought against the city for the exact same reason. The new ordinance puts more stringent restrictions on how the homeless can be fed—for instance, food providers must offer toilet facilities, something Abbott can't manage, Fox News reports. Vocal supporters for the law include Mayor Jack Seiler, who tells the Sun-Sentinel, \\"I'm not satisfied with having a cycle of homeless in [the] city of Fort Lauderdale. Providing them with a meal and keeping them in that cycle on the street is not productive.\\" Cal Deal, a retired journalist who records homeless people around town, agrees. \\"The people feeding them are enablers,\\" he tells the New Times Broward-Palm Beach. \\"Hunger is a big motivator. Are people more likely to seek help when they're hungry or when they're fed and happy?\\" Rev.

If Arnold and his friends keep doing this, they could be in trouble and may have to pay money or even go to jail for a short time.

Gramophone record Electric recording which developed during the time that early radio was becoming popular (1925) benefited from the microphones and amplifiers used in radio studios. The early electric recordings were reminiscent tonally of acoustic recordings, except there was more recorded bass and treble as well as delicate sounds and overtones cut on the records. This was in spite of some carbon microphones used, which had resonances that colored the recorded tone. The double button carbon microphone with stretched diaphragm was a marked improvement. Alternatively, the Wente style condenser microphone used with the Western Electric licensed recording method had a brilliant midrange and was prone to overloading from sibilants in speech, but generally it gave more accurate reproduction than carbon microphones. Q: What type of microphones were losing popularity in the 1920s?","output":"In the 1920s, carbon microphones were losing popularity. This was due to several factors, including their tendency to have resonances that colored the recorded tone and the introduction of newer, more advanced microphone technologies. As electric recording developed, microphones such as the double button carbon microphone with a stretched diaphragm and the Wente style condenser microphone emerged, offering improvements over the earlier carbon microphones. While these newer microphone types provided more accurate and better sound reproduction, carbon microphones became less popular and were eventually replaced by more sophisticated technologies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.  I am facing a new situation today: Two friends were involved in a car crash. they both survived, but Mike had a serious brain injury. Vince was OK, he didn't experience any significant injuries.

It has a periapsis of 3997100000000.0 and its apoapsis is 7715100000.0 kilometres. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"This sentence provides valuable information about a celestial object, specifically an asteroid, identified as (15788) 1993 SB. By analyzing the sentence, we can extract the following key data points: 1. Discovery location: The asteroid was discovered by Roque de los Muchachos Observatory. This observatory is located on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands, Spain. At an altitude of 2,396 meters (7,861 feet), it is one of the world's leading facilities for astronomical research and houses several large telescopes. 2. Discovery year and identification: (15788) 1993 SB was detected in the year 1993, as indicated by the name of the asteroid itself. The alphanumeric name is comprised of the object's provisional designation number (15788) and its temporary alphanumeric designation (1993 SB) assigned during the observation period. 3. Epoch date: The epoch date provided (March 6th, 2006) corresponds to the specific instant in time for which the asteroid's orbital elements were calculated. The epoch is an essential parameter utilized for accurate orbital predictions and calculations of celestial objects. 4. Periapsis distance: The asteroid has a periapsis distance of 3,997,100,000,000.0 meters, or approximately 3.997 trillion meters. Periapsis refers to the point in a celestial object's orbit at which it is closest to its parent body (in this case, the Sun). This information can be used to determine the shape and eccentricity of the asteroid's orbit. 5. Apoapsis distance: The apoapsis distance is given as 7,715,100,000.0 kilometers or approximately 7.715 billion kilometers. The apoapsis is the point in the orbit of a celestial object where it is farthest from its parent body (the Sun in this case). With both periapsis and apoapsis values, it's possible to deduce the extent of the asteroid's elliptical orbit around the Sun. By examining this sentence, scientists and astronomy enthusiasts can derive pertinent details about the discovery, orbital characteristics, and physical data of the asteroid (15788) 1993 SB. This information can be further applied to understand the long-term orbital behavior, study the asteroid's composition and properties, and monitor its potential impact or influence on other celestial bodies within the Solar System."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
