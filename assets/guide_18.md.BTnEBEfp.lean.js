So when he began dabbling heavily in cryptocurrencies years ago, his friends and family tried to dissuade him, figuring it was another erratic obsession. And, indeed, he abandoned some early investments and sold his Bitcoin a few years ago.      But then Mellon got turned on to XRP, spending some 2 million to acquire coins, which he liked because it's one of the few cryptocurrencies that are working within the banking system. \\"Crypto is scary and dark. It's anti-America,\\" says Mellon, 54. \\"I am pro-America, pro-business and pro-bank. That's why I went with Ripple.\\"      Mellon's XRP is worth around 1 billion. Recently divorced, he parties in a posh Los Angeles house he rents for 150,000 month. \\"It's 1 billion virtually for free.

Mellon, an early backer of global settlement network Ripple, was the ex-husband of Jimmy Choo guru Tamara Mellon and of designer Nicole Hanley, his second wife.      A rep said in a statement: “Billionaire Matthew Mellon, 53, died suddenly in Cancun, Mexico, where he was attending a drug rehabilitation facility. Mellon made his fortune in cryptocurrency, turning a 2 million investment into 1 billion. He is survived by his three children, Force, Olympia and Minty. The family asks that their privacy be respected at this very painful time.”      On Tuesday, the same rep amended their statement to say: “Billionaire Matthew Mellon, 53, died suddenly in Cancun, Mexico, where he was planning to check into a rehabilitation facility for follow-up treatment.”      Mellon, a former chair of the New York Republican Party’s finance committee, had battled addiction.      In 2016, he told The Post, “OxyContin is like legal heroin. And it needs to be addressed,” while at a Malibu treatment center kicking a habit of 100,000 a month.      But he was in Forbes this year for his latest investments.

Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Who has won more Grand Slam doubles titles, Elizabeth Smylie or Vasek Pospisil? The answer is:","output":"Elizabeth Smylie has won more Grand Slam doubles titles than Vasek Pospisil. In order to provide a detailed and reasoned explanation, let's first dive into the careers of both these professional tennis players, comparing their accomplishments and statistics in the sport. Elizabeth Smylie, an Australian tennis player born on April 11, 1963, retired in 1999. During her professional tennis career, she focused primarily on doubles competitions. Smylie managed to excel in this discipline, winning a total of four Grand Slam doubles titles. These titles are as follows: 1. Australian Open (1985): Partnering with Kathy Jordan, the duo won the women's doubles event by defeating the team of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver in the final. 2. French Open (1988): Teaming up with Wendy Turnbull, the pair secured the title in the women's doubles competition, overcoming the team of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver. 3. Wimbledon (1985): In the women's doubles category, Smylie and Kathy Jordan emerged victorious against the pair of Hana Mandlíková and Wendy Turnbull in the final match. 4. US Open (1989): Smylie, alongside her partner Hana Mandlíková, won the women's doubles championship, defeating the team of Martina Navratilova and Patty Fendick in the final. In addition to her doubles accomplishments, Smylie also earned one Grand Slam title in mixed doubles, winning the 1990 Wimbledon Championships alongside her partner Todd Woodbridge. On the other hand, Vasek Pospisil, a Canadian tennis player born on June 23, 1990, has achieved success in both singles and doubles competitions. Throughout his career, Pospisil has won only one Grand Slam doubles title so far: 1. Wimbledon (2014): Partnering with Jack Sock, Pospisil won the men's doubles event by defeating the opposing team of Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan in the final. While Pospisil has had an impressive career and continues to compete in professional tournaments, Elizabeth Smylie has the edge in terms of Grand Slam doubles titles. With four Grand Slam doubles titles and one mixed doubles title to her name, Smylie's accomplishments in the world of professional tennis surpass those of Pospisil, who currently has one major doubles title to his credit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Genocide: Other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action. A history of what is just one factor that contributes to the probability of violence developing into genocide?","output":"A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim is just one factor that contributes to the probability of violence developing into genocide.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose husband is a wealthy businessman?, using the article: Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Whose husband is a wealthy businessman?\\" is Doris Hillman. In the given article, it is stated that her husband, Gus Hillman, is a wealthy businessman who is willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for a venture in which Edward Shaw, the down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder, would be involved. Specifically, Doris Hillman proposes a business idea to Edward Shaw which involves them buying land together, and Shaw would build houses on this land. Doris, with her experience as a former real estate broker, would then sell these houses. The businessman in question is Gus Hillman, who is willing to financially support this venture with a significant sum of money. However, unbeknownst to Edward Shaw initially, it seems that the Hillmans' primary interest in the business venture might be related to the potential financial gain from a 175,000 key man insurance policy on Shaw's life, rather than the potential long-term profits of their partnership. Throughout the course of the story, both personal and professional relationships become entangled, with Doris and Edward starting an affair, and Doris's younger sister, Madge, also developing a romantic interest in Edward. As the plot unfolds, it reveals multiple layers of deception and manipulation, eventually leading to a climax of violence and tragedy for the Hillmans, while Edward Shaw, wounded but ultimately surviving, manages to escape their plan with the help of Madge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - Wang Mang (c. 45  6 October 23 AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \\"renewed\\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos.  - Han Xuan was a minor warlord and the Administrator (  ) of Changsha (  ) commandery during the late Han Dynasty . He served under Liu Biao , governor of Jing Province , for three years . After Liu Biao 's death , the northern part of Jing Province was divided between two of Liu Biao 's sons , Liu Qi and Liu Cong . The southern portion was divided between four Administrators , Zhao Fan , Jin Xuan , Liu Du and Han Xuan . Eventually , Changsha became an independent region under Han Xuan , and his land remained undisturbed by the other warlords for two years . Then in 210 , Liu Bei invaded Jing Province , capturing all the lands from their leaders .  - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC  9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD).  - The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the end of the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved.  - Jin Xuan (died 209), courtesy name Yuanji (), was a minor warlord and Administrator of Wuling Commandery in the late Eastern Han Dynasty.  - The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han.  - Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty.  - Cao Cao (155  15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals.  - Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history.  - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing.  - Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Guiyang. Name. The area was first organized as an administrative region of a Chinese empire under the Tang, when it was named Juzhou, pronounced \\"Kjú-jyuw\\" in the Middle Chinese of the period. During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\"). The region formally became a province in 1413, with an eponymous capital then also called \\"Guizhou\\" but now known as Guiyang.  - Zhao Fan was a minor warlord and prefect of Guiyang Commandery during the late Han Dynasty period of Chinese history. Zhao Fan surrendered to Zhao Yun after being attacked by his army at Guiyang following the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhao Fan then unintentionally sparked the rage of Zhao Yun by suggesting his marriage to his older brother's widow. He became a minister of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period.  - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors.  - Zhao Yun (died 229), courtesy name Zilong, was a military general who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han  founded by Liu Bei in 221  in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life had been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", in which he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei.  - Liu Bei (161  10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu.  - Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC  June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202  195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class.  - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong.

A: A:","output":"Free-living roundworms, also known as nematodes, are an incredibly diverse and abundant group of organisms that inhabit a wide range of environments on Earth. These microscopic organisms play a vital role in nutrient cycling and decomposition in many ecosystems. The main habitats where free-living roundworms are predominately found include: 1. Soil environments: The most common habitat for free-living roundworms is in the soil. They are particularly abundant in terrestrial ecosystems, where they contribute to the decomposition of organic matter and the release of essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. In soil environments, roundworms inhabit various niches, including plant roots, leaf litter, and beneath stones or logs. 2. Arboreal habitats: Roundworms are also present in arboreal habitats, such as tree trunks and the canopy of forests. In these environments, they live in association with decaying plant materials, fungal hyphae, and mosses. They play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients for the growth of plants present in these habitats. 3. Rainforests: Rainforests, with their rich biodiversity and high humidity levels, provide an ideal environment for free-living roundworms. They can be found in leaf litter, the forest floor, and even within the canopy. In rainforests, these nematodes play a significant role in the food chain, serving as prey for various invertebrates and contributing to the overall nutrient cycling. 4. Ocean depths: Marine environments are also home to numerous free-living roundworms. In the depths of the ocean, roundworms inhabit various substrates, such as the surface of deep-sea rocks, hydrothermal vents, and sediments on the ocean floor. They serve as decomposers and nutrient cyclers, breaking down dead organic matter, as well as forming a vital part of the deep-sea food web. 5. Freshwater habitats: In freshwater habitats, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds, free-living roundworms are found in benthic sediments and submerged vegetation. They play a crucial role in breaking down detritus, decaying plant matter, and other organic materials, thereby releasing essential nutrients back into the ecosystem. In conclusion, free-living roundworms are primarily found in soil environments, arboreal habitats, rainforests, ocean depths, and freshwater habitats. Their abundance and diversity are a testament to their adaptability and ecological importance. As decomposers and nutrient cyclers, they play a crucial role in sustaining the health and productivity of various ecosystems around the world."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: Good for the price Product review: This rope is definitely nothing fancy nor is that what it is intended to be.

If North Korea agreed to freeze development of its nuclear arsenal , or if Iran agreed to stop its nuclear enrichment programme , once the meeting between the two leaders took place , the position from which they started negotiating would be significantly weaker than the USs .","output":"The argument implied by these sentences revolves around the dynamics and strategies of diplomatic negotiations, specifically in relation to the United States, Iran, and North Korea. The opening sentence recognizes a potential evolution in Obama's stance regarding meeting with Iran, suggesting a shift or development in his approach to these discussions.  The second sentence highlights the argument that it would be imprudent for a country to agree to significant preconditions prior to negotiations, as these very preconditions would be the main subject of the discussions themselves. In other words, accepting certain demands beforehand would render the need for negotiations redundant and weaken the position of the country agreeing to the preconditions. Next, the argument emphasizes that it is unlikely for any nation to accept conditions that would compromise its bargaining power during negotiations. This idea supports the notion that countries should maintain a strong stance in order to achieve favorable outcomes in diplomatic discussions. The reference to \\"Klein, Rick\\" possibly implies that the subsequent information or ideas are attributed to the aforementioned individual. However, without further context, it is unclear who Rick Klein is and how his thoughts contribute to the argument. Lastly, the argument articulates the consequences of countries like North Korea or Iran agreeing to vital preconditions, such as suspending development of nuclear weapons or enrichment programs. The statement suggests that if these countries accepted such terms before a meeting with the United States, they would be left with a significantly weaker negotiating position compared to the US. This observation reinforces the overarching thesis of the argument, which advocates for preserving bargaining power and exercising caution when engaging in diplomatic negotiations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The brakes on the Ford Focus need to be changed, but the tires are fine because the","output":"tread depth is still within the recommended range. In order to complete this task properly, it is essential to follow a few important steps. Step 1: Gather the necessary tools and supplies To change the brakes on a Ford Focus, one would need the appropriate tools and supplies. This includes a jack, jack stands, a lug wrench, a socket wrench, pliers, a torque wrench, a rubber mallet, and the replacement brake pads or rotor, if needed. Also, ensure that you have a safe, flat surface to work on. Step 2: Raise the vehicle Before starting any work, make sure the vehicle is on a flat surface with the parking brake engaged. Use the jack to lift the vehicle and place it on jack stands for extra security. Be sure to chock the wheels to prevent any possible movement. Step 3: Remove the tire Use the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts in a star pattern and then remove the tire. Set it aside, ensuring it is out of the workspace. Step 4: Inspect the brake components Examine the brake caliper, brake pads, rotor, and other components for wear and tear. In this case, we know that the brake pads need to be changed. If the rotor is damaged or has deep grooves, it should be replaced as well. Step 5: Remove the brake caliper Use the socket wrench to remove the bolts holding the brake caliper in place. After it's loose, use pliers to carefully remove the caliper without damaging the brake line. Hang the caliper using a wire or string so that it doesn't dangle and put stress on the brake line. Step 6: Replace the brake pads Remove the old brake pads from the caliper bracket. It's a good practice to clean the caliper bracket with a wire brush before installing the new pads. Apply brake grease to the contact points of the new brake pads to help reduce noise. Install the new brake pads by placing them in the caliper bracket. Step 7: Reinstall the brake caliper If necessary, use a caliper piston tool or a C-clamp to push the piston back into the caliper. Carefully reinstall the brake caliper over the new brake pads and tighten the bolts using the torque wrench according to the manufacturer's specifications. Step 8: Reattach the tire Place the tire back onto the wheel studs and hand-tighten the lug nuts. Lower the vehicle and remove the jack stands. Then, use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern, ensuring they are properly secured. Step 9: Test the brakes Start the engine and press the brake pedal a few times to ensure proper brake pressure. Once confident that the brakes are functioning correctly, take the vehicle for a slow and careful test drive, making sure the brakes respond well and there is no unusual noise. By following these steps, the brakes on the Ford Focus will now be changed successfully.

It premiered on 20 May 2000, at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or. Leung won a Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor for his performance.  - The Pearl River Delta (PRD), also known as Zhujiang Delta or Zhusanjiao, is the low-lying area surrounding the Pearl River estuary, where the Pearl River flows into the South China Sea. It is one of the most densely urbanised regions in the world and is an economic hub of China. This region is often considered an emerging megacity. The PRD is a megalopolis, with future development into a single mega metropolitan area, yet itself is at the southern end of a larger megalopolis running along the southern coast of China, which include metropolises such as Chaoshan, Zhangzhou-Xiamen, Quanzhou-Putian, and Fuzhou. The nine largest cities of PRD had a combined population of 57.15 million at the end of 2013, comprising 53.69% of the provincial population. According to the World Bank Group, the PRD has become the largest urban area in the world in both size and population.  - The Palme d'Or is the highest prize awarded at the Cannes Film Festival. It was introduced in 1955 by the organising committee. From 1939 to 1954, the highest prize was the \\"Grand Prix du Festival International du Film\\".   - Valerie Chow, aka Rachel Shane (born 16 December 1970) is a former Hong Kong actress, fashion publicist and entrepreneur.  - Maggie Cheung Man-yuk (born 20 September 1964) is a Hong Kong actress. Raised in Britain and Hong Kong, she has over 70 films to her credit since starting her career in 1983. Some of her most commercially successful work was in the action genre, but Cheung once said in an interview that of all the work she has done, the films that really meant something to her are \\"Song of Exile\\", \\"Centre Stage\\", \\"\\" and \\"In the Mood for Love\\". As Emily Wang in \\"Clean\\", her last starring role to date, she became the first Asian actress to win a prize at the Cannes Film Festival.  - Andy Lau Tak-wah, BBS, MH, JP (born 27 September 1961) is a Hong Kong actor, singer and film producer. He has been one of Hong Kong's most commercially successful film actors since the mid-1980s, performing in more than 160 films while maintaining a successful singing career at the same time. In the 1990s, Lau was branded by the media as one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Cantopop.  - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: 1. Organism's death: The organism (animal or plant) dies in an environment that is conducive to fossilization, such as a body of water, swamp, or an area prone to rapid sedimentation. This helps slow down the decomposition process and protect the remains from immediate destruction by scavengers, weather, and other natural processes. Upon the death of the organism, its body begins to settle on the substrate or land surface, starting the process of fossilization.  Followed by the existing steps: 2. The soft tissue decomposes: The soft tissues of the organism, like skin, muscles, and internal organs, begin to break down due to the actions of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. This decomposition process can be slowed if the environment is oxygen-poor or has chemical factors which discourage microbial action. 3. The bones are left behind: As the soft tissue decomposes, the skeletal remains (bones, shells, or other hard parts) are left behind. 4. Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere: Scavengers such as vultures, hyenas, or insects may encounter the remains and further break them apart while feeding on them, scattering the bones in the process. 5. Wind and rain also scatter the bones further: Weathering processes like wind and rain can erode the bones' original position, moving them further from their initial location. 6. The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil: Over time, sediments such as sand, silt, and clay, carried by wind or water, accumulate on top of the bones and bury them, protecting them from further weathering or scavenging. 7. The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil: Through a process called permineralization, mineral-rich water seeps into the buried bones. The minerals gradually replace organic material and harden the bones, turning them into stone-like structures. 8. This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil: The mineralized remains become fossils, which can be preserved for millions of years within layers of rock. 9. Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil: Over time, the layers of sediment above the fossil are eroded by natural forces, bringing the fossil closer to the surface. 10. This makes discovery of the fossil possible: As the fossil is exposed to the surface, it becomes accessible to paleontologists and other scientists who can study and research the extinct organism, providing valuable insights into the history of life on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which artist used a terrace at St Thomas' Hospital as a vantage point for his series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament?","output":"The artist who used a terrace at St. Thomas' Hospital as a vantage point for his series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament is Claude Monet, a renowned French Impressionist painter. Born on November 14, 1840, Monet was a critical figure in the Impressionist movement that transformed French painting in the second half of the 19th century. During his career, Monet employed a unique technique that focused on capturing light and vivid hues, emphasizing the beauty and vibrancy of the scenes he painted. The paintings of the Houses of Parliament were created during his three-month stay in London between late 1899 and early 1900. He worked on this series at the nearby St. Thomas' Hospital, which offered an ideal vantage point for observing and capturing the structures across the River Thames amid the distinctive atmosphere. The series includes approximately nineteen canvases featuring the iconic political buildings that house the United Kingdom's legislative body. Monet was particularly intrigued by the way fog and pollution diffused sunlight, creating an intricate blend of colors and a mysterious effect around the Houses of Parliament. This atmospheric display can be seen in his celebrated works such as \\"The Houses of Parliament, Sunset,\\" \\"Houses of Parliament, Effect of Sunlight in the Fog\\" and \\"The Houses of Parliament with Fog.\\" During the time he painted this series, Monet was staying at the Savoy Hotel, where he had set up a studio within his suite. Every day, he would travel to the terrace at St. Thomas' Hospital, armed with numerous canvases. Monet would repeatedly work on multiple canvases simultaneously, as he aimed to capture the changes in lighting throughout the day and the various moods that the atmosphere evoked. Monet's Houses of Parliament series showcases the power of the Impressionist approach, which took advantage of brief, thick brushstrokes and a thorough understanding of light and color to render stunning landscapes and scenes. It remains one of his most famous series and a testament to his artistic innovation and vision in the world of art."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  The grave digger  for the following movie plot:  This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

Article: Kindergarten outside? Yes, indeed. It's part of a growing worldwide trend toward outdoor education. The schools are called forest kindergartens. The numbers are small so far in the U.S., but the idea is well established in Europe, with schools in Scotland, England, and Switzerland. By far the most such schools are in Germany, which has more than 400 forest kindergartens. Some schools feature several hours of outdoor schooling. This is certainly the case with the Waldorf School of Saratoga Springs. Children there will be venturing out on the nearby Hemlock Trail to learn more about the natural world. Some lessons are focused on nature; others are academic topics delivered in a natural setting. In all cases, students are active-not sitting at desks or on mats on the floor but walking, running, jumping, solving problems like how to get the mud off the bottoms of their shoes before their parents find out. Seriously, the focus is on activity at these schools. Studies have shown that children's immune systems actually get stronger after all of the outdoor activity, and that graduates of forest kindergartens show a higher ability to learn when they progress through their academic careers. Other schools are all outdoors, all the time. This is the case with the Cedar Song Nature School, on Vashon Island, Washington. Students at this school spend their whole three-hour day outdoors, in a private five-acre forest, doing all kinds of physical activities. At these forest kindergartens, students learn science by observing and doing it, learn math by applying it to the natural world around them, learn letters and words by putting them together using sights and sounds. These students learn how to get along with one another, individually and in a group. They also develop healthy levels of self-confidence. Nowadays many children become obese  because of sedentary  activities like watching television and playing video games. These outdoor schools give children chances to learn just as much, if not more, from opening their eyes... Question: What is special about forest kindergartens?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 22:13 EST, 6 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 16:42 EST, 7 October 2012. The death toll has risen to seven from a 'rapidly evolving outbreak' of rare fungal meningitis that has been linked to spinal steroid injections, sparking fear as new cases have been reported in nine U.S. states. The potential scope of the meningitis outbreak, that has sickened 64 people, widened dramatically as health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk. The outbreak of the disease, known as aspergillus meningitis, is caused by a fungus found in a spinal steroid injections, a fairly common treatment used to relieve back pain, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Beware: Health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk (stock photo) The latest fatalities were reported in Michigan on Saturday, though the Michigan Department of Community Health said they would not provide more information on the two deaths until after the weekend. The fifth victim, Diana Reed, died on Wednesday afternoon at St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, surrounded by family members. Mrs. Reed, 56, is one of thousands of patients recently treated in Tennessee. hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical. treatment. But since then a tainted batch of steroids released across. the U.S. has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis. Mrs Reed, of Brentwood, Tennessee, was the fifth person to succumb to the infection. A blog written by a close friend of Reed's family, Brandon Scott Thomas, characterized her as 'hilarious, beautiful, and full of life' and praised her for carrying for husband Wayne Reed after he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease - almost 20 years ago. 'Over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next,' wrote. 'Her brain couldn't take the stress. After a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care. Wayne, one of the longest surviving patients with ALS, there by her side.' Reed served on the board of her husband's namesake child care organization, the Wayne Reed Christian Child Care Center. The caretaker: Diana Reed dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children before a routine medical procedure infected her with a rare fungal meningitis. Source: The outbreak of the deadly form of meningitis was traced to St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. The injectable steroids responsible. for Reed's death were produced by New England Compounding Center, a. specialized pharmacy in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection. It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick. So far, 64 people in nine states - Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio - have contracted fungal meningitis, and five have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In an alarming indication that the outbreak. could get a lot bigger, Massachusetts health officials said the pharmacy. involved, the New England Compounding Center of Framingham, has. recalled three lots consisting of a total of 17,676 single-dose vials of. the steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. No solicitors: Specialized pharmacy New England Compounding Center has hidden from the public as its steroids are linked to multiple deaths and critical infections. An unknown number of those vials reached 75 clinics and other facilities in 23 states between July and September, federal health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have been returned unused, one Massachusetts official said. However many other vials were used. At one clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots, officials said. At two clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients received them. The incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days, and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials, who are now calling this a national health crisis. Tennessee: The initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases, two of whom are in critical condition. Three others have already died. North Carolina: The second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic. Florida: Only two cases have been reported but health officials fear more may come forward. Virginia: One person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated. Maryland: Seven medical clinics in Maryland pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported. Indiana: At least five people in Indiana are sick with fungal meningitis, with no fatalities yet reported. Michigan: There are at least eight confirmed cases of meningitis in Michigan, including two deaths. Minnesota: Fungal meningitis has been diagnosed in two women hospitalized in Minnesota. Ohio: Health officials reported Saturday of a 65-year-old man being treated for the meningitis after receiving the steroid. Unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis is not contagious. It is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include a severe headache, nausea, fever, and dizziness. The first patients identified in Tennessee experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating. The pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid Methylprednisolone Acetate on September 26 according to the FDA. The drug is primarily used to relieve back pain. The drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s. Tennessee's S. Thomas Hospital, ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of Wednesday with two in critical condition, reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered. 'Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill - very, very. seriously ill and may die,' Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan. said. In Tennessee alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid. The link between the injections and the. meningitis was discovered by Tennessee physician April Pettit, who found. the initial cases were all people who'd recently received an epidural. Officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis. New England Compounding Center. released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to. discover what happened. But company president and licensed pharmacist. Barry J. Cadden has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company. web site is down. An archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every U.S. state. Critical condition: Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan says the infected are 'very, very seriously ill and may die' New England Compounding Center is among the approximately 3,000 U.S. compounding pharmacies specializing in blending, liquefying, or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets, require specific dosages, or who have allergies. Such companies are regulated by the. state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the. broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with. The pharmacy has produced questionable. products before. In 2006, New England Compounding Center was one of. four companies ordered by the the Food and Drug Administration to cease. producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause 'grave. reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats.' The cream was the cause of two deaths, neither tied directly to New England Compounding Center. Ground zero: The first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at St. Thomas Hospital which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock. That same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices. They were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment, misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use, and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose. An FDA warning letter admonished the company that it was 'distributing an unapproved drug in violation' of federal regulations. In 2010 the company was sued by an Illinois firm that alleged New England Compounding Center illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act. The case was eventually settled. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article talks about a serious outbreak of a rare fungal meningitis in the United States in 2012.

I'll break down the sentences into these components. Note that \\"bn\\" and \\"bil\\" both refer to \\"billion,\\" so throughout the analysis, I will use \\"billion\\" for consistency. Sentence 1: \\"BP sells some Gulf of Mexico assets for 5.55 billion\\" - Subject: BP - Action: sells - Object: some Gulf of Mexico assets - Context: for 5.55 billion Sentence 2: \\"BP sells Gulf of Mexico assets to Plains for 5.55 billion\\" - Subject: BP - Action: sells - Object: Gulf of Mexico assets - Context: to Plains; for 5.55 billion Now, let's evaluate the similarity based on each criterion: 1. Subject: Both sentences have the same subject, BP. Similarity: 5/5 2. Action: Both sentences have the same action, which is selling. Similarity: 5/5 3. Object: Both sentences involve BP selling Gulf of Mexico assets. However, Sentence 1 specifies that BP is selling \\"some\\" assets, rather than all of them. Sentence 2 does not indicate if all or only some assets are being sold, but the absence of the word \\"some\\" can potentially imply the sale of all the assets. Nevertheless, both sentences revolve around the same objects: Gulf of Mexico assets. Similarity: 4/5 4. Context: Sentence 1 does not mention a buyer, while Sentence 2 specifies that the buyer is Plains. This difference indicates that the context is not identical between the two sentences. Similarity: 3/5 5. Value: Both sentences mention the same monetary value, 5.55 billion. Similarity: 5/5 To calculate the overall similarity, we can average the similarity scores from each criterion: (5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 5) / 5 = 22/5 = 4.4 Based on the analysis, the similarity between the two sentences is 4.4 on a scale from 0 to 5. This means that the sentences are quite similar, but there are small differences in context and the omission of the word \\"some\\" in Sentence 2."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here is an article: NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The nation's financial markets will be closed Tuesday to honor former President Gerald Ford, marking a rare four-day closing for U.S. trading. The New York Stock Exchange said Friday it will be closed on Jan. 2 for the national day of mourning for the 38th president, a day after the Nasdaq stock market said it also will be closed. Over the last century, the markets have traditionally closed to commemorate the death of a past or sitting president. Ford, who became the first non-elected U.S. president in 1974, after the threat of impeachment forced the resignation of Richard Nixon, died this week on Tuesday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., at age 93. Separately, the Federal Reserve will be closed Tuesday and has delayed the release of the minutes from its December meeting to Wednesday at 2 p.m. EST. The Fed's 12 regional banks will remain open Tuesday. With Monday's New Year's Day holiday and Tuesday's closing, the markets will be closed for an unusual four days. Aside from the stock exchanges, the commodities and futures markets said their main operations will be shut down for the day. The New York Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange all said their floor trading operations will be closed. The New York Merc metals and energy futures and options markets will close early on Friday. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, formerly the Bond Market Association, recommended an early close Tuesday. It was closed for an entire day for President Ronald Reagan's funeral. A spokesman could not give a reason for the partial closing. At his ranch in Crawford, Texas on Thursday, President Bush declared Tuesday a national day of mourning for Ford, closing most federal offices for the day. Ford's body will be flown to Washington on Saturday and his casket will lie in state at the Capitol. Bush is due to speak at a service in his memory Tuesday, a White House spokesman told Reuters. During his presidency, Ford sought to calm the turbulence caused by the Vietnam war and Watergate. In his effort to heal this strife, he notably granted Mr. Nixon a \\"full, free and absolute pardon\\" from prosecution early in his term of office. Later on, Ford served on the board of the NASD from 1999-2000, before the Nasdaq stock market was spun off from its former parent. Ford's \\"leadership and invaluable service during his time on the NASD board contributed to what the Nasdaq is today,\\" Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld said in a statement. The day of a president's funeral has traditionally been a national day of mourning. Most recently financial markets were closed Friday, June 11, 2004, after Reagan died. Throughout the 20th century, the NYSE traditionally has observed the death of former and sitting presidents by closing for an entire day. Former President William McKinley's funeral was the first to be so honored on Thursday, Sept. 19, 1901. Five presidents were honored with partial closings: Herbert Hoover (1964), William Howard Taft (1930), Woodrow Wilson (1924), Theodore Roosevelt (1919), and Grover Cleveland (1908). Benjamin Harrison, whose funeral was held on March 13, 1901, was not honored with a memorial closing. There are no records to indicate the reasoning.

Information:  - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.  - Irises is one of many paintings and prints of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh . Irises was painted while Vincent van Gogh was living at the asylum at Saint Paul - de - Mausole in Saint - Rémy - de - Provence , France , in the last year before his death in 1890 . It was painted before his first attack at the asylum . There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works . He called the painting \`\` the lightning conductor for my illness '' because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint . The painting was influenced by Japanese ukiyo - e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time . The similarities occur with strong outlines , unusual angles , including close - up views , and also flattish local colour ( not modelled according to the fall of light ) . He considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it , although Theo , Van Gogh 's brother , thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889 , together with Starry Night Over the Rhone . He wrote to Vincent of the exhibition : \`\` ( It ) strikes the eye from afar . The Irises are a beautiful study full of air and life . ''  - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.

Special forces could've responded to Benghazi attack, whistle-blower tells Fox News A military special ops member who watched as the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi unfolded last September told Fox News the U.S. had highly trained forces just a few hours away, and said he and others feel the government betrayed the four men who died in the attack. Speaking on condition of anonymity, and appearing in a Fox News Channel interview with his face and voice disguised, the special operator contradicted claims by the Obama administration and a State Department review that said there wasn’t enough time for U.S. military forces to have intervened in the Sept. 11 attack in which U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, an embassy employee and two former Navy SEALs working as private security contractors were killed. “I know for a fact that C-110, the EUCOM CIF, was doing a training exercise in … not in the region of North Africa, but in Europe,” the operator told Fox News' Adam Housley. “And they had the ability to act and to respond.” The C-110 is a 40-man Special Ops force capable of rapid response and deployment specifically trained for incidents like last year’s attack in Benghazi. During the night of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Libya, in which U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in Libya, the C-110 were training in Croatia, just 3 ½ hours away. “We had the ability to load out, get on birds and fly there, at a minimum stage,” the operator told Fox News. “C-110 had the ability to be there, in my opinion, in a matter of about four hours…four to six hours.” Being so close, C-110s would have been able to respond had there been a second attack, the source added. “They would have been there at a minimum to provide a quick reaction force that can facilitate their exfil out of the, out of the problem situation. Nobody knew how it was going to develop. And you hear people and a whole bunch of advisers say, 'We wouldn’t have sent them because the security was a unknown situation.'” The source says the government could have at least sent the C-110s there as backup. “If it’s an unknown situation, at a minimum, you send forces there to facilitate the exfil, or, or, um medical injuries,” he said. “We could have sent a C-30 to Benghazi to provide medical evacuation for the injured.” The source says many people connected to the Benghazi bombing feel threatened and are afraid to talk. “The problem is, you got guys in my position, you got guys in special operations community who are still active and still involved,” the source said. “And they would be decapitated if they came forward with information that would affect high level commanders,” he said. Despite the concern, the source who spoke to Fox News says there’s a feeling of betrayal in the community that the government left people on the ground in Benghazi to fend for themselves. “You know, it’s something that’s risky, especially in our line of profession, to say anything about, anything in the realm of politics, or that deals with policy,” the source said. In December, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen told lawmakers the U.S. did not have personnel close enough to have responded to the siege at the consulate, even though the State Department had been repeatedly warned by embassy staffers concerned about security in Libya. “It is not reasonable, nor feasible, to tether U.S. forces at the ready to respond to protect every high-risk post in the world,” Mullen said.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.  Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws.  Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who wrote an autobiography in 1936?  Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite...

Write a title for this article: SEOUL, South Korea — Two months ago, John C. Liu, New York City’s comptroller, said he was “heartbroken” that the state’s top Democrats, skittish about a federal investigation into his campaign fund-raising, had excluded him from their delegate list to the Democratic National Convention. But this week, as most of the Democratic establishment, including all of his presumed major rivals in the 2013 race for mayor, gathers in Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Liu is doing his best to attract attention 7,000 miles away in Asia. He is visiting Seoul and Taipei, Taiwan, as part of a four-day whirlwind trip that will feature at least 14 events, including audiences with the mayor of Seoul and the vice president of Taiwan. One of the highlights of the trip came on Tuesday, when he delivered a speech at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul to a packed auditorium of more than 230 people, including 100 exchange students from the State University of New York, Mr. Liu’s alma mater. Mr. Liu, who was born in Taiwan but moved to New York as a child, said he was in Asia to promote business and investment opportunities for the city. The trip also promises to afford him a chance to connect with civic and business leaders who have ties to American immigrant communities and who could be potential donors, according to two people close to Mr. Liu. The host governments are paying for Mr. Liu’s airfare and lodging, which is permissible under city rules. In Seoul, many of Mr. Liu’s activities were arranged by Korea’s consulate in New York City, as well as by Mr. Liu’s office, according to the organizers. The organizers said they had discussed the federal inquiry into the comptroller’s campaign fund-raising, which so far has resulted in the arrests of his former treasurer and a top fund-raiser. “I am aware that Mr. Liu’s staff is under investigation, and we had a staff meeting about this,” said Jang Tae-yeoub, dean of external affairs at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “But we decided to go ahead with his visiting our university because the investigation is ongoing and not final.” Park Yoon-joo, a director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said, “I do not think it is our business to get involved in those domestic political affairs,” before praising Mr. Liu as “a very active, promising leader fostering good relationships with various minority communities including the Korean-Americans.” At times, Mr. Liu touched on the political issues being discussed in Charlotte. Asked about “the most crucial factor in passing the budget,” for instance, he offered a rousing defense of President Obama. He said that “in my opinion, from Day 1, there were some people in Washington who were determined to see President Obama fail,” and he criticized the Tea Party, particularly for “standing in the way and making life difficult for the president.” Mr. Liu also addressed issues that would most likely be highlighted if he ran for mayor next year, including his aggressive auditing of city agencies, his desire to speed up infrastructure development and his personal history as an immigrant who was “made in Taiwan.” The city’s “Asian-American population continues to grow, is talented and is clearly on the move as they serve as our bridge to Asia,” he said to his audience at Hankuk University. “I want all of you to help me build that bridge,” he added, before saying, “Gamsahamnida,” which means “thank you” in Korean. This week’s trip is the fourth that Mr. Liu has taken overseas since becoming comptroller in January 2010, but his first since November 2010. From Seoul, he flew to Taiwan — his birthplace and the island of origin of many of the immigrants who are a dominant force in his Flushing neighborhood. His schedule included visits to two cabinet ministries and an address to the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance. Even in Seoul, which is 6,885 miles from New York, Mr. Liu was asked about his possible candidacy for mayor. “I can’t believe I am in Seoul and people are still asking me that question,” he said at one point. At a 7-Eleven outside the university after his speech, Mr. Liu acknowledged that he had given the idea some thought. “People say that I would be a different kind of mayor,” he said, after buying a bottle of Korean corn tea and a pack of dried squid. “I think it would be obvious why.” Su Hyun Lee reported from Seoul, and David W. Chen from New York.","output":"\\"New York City Comptroller John C. Liu Ventures to Asia Amid DNC Exclusion and Federal Investigation\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By. Daily Mail Reporter. and Ap. Buddy Cianci, the twice-convicted felon who led Providence as mayor for 21 years, wants his old job back. Cianci said Wednesday that he is running as an independent for a seventh term as mayor. The last time he won an election was 16 years ago — before he was convicted in 2002 of racketeering conspiracy for widespread corruption in his administration. He spent 4 ½ years in prison. Cianci, 73, said he is not seeking redemption, but wishes to bring his experience and vision to the city to make a difference. He said Providence can't afford to have a mayor who is getting 'on-the-job training.' Convict: Buddy Cianci was twice forced from office after assault and corruption convictions. Making an announcement on his radio show, Cianci said that many people would call this an eleventh-hour decision, but that he decided to join the field after much soul-searching and reflection. He said he wants to rekindle the city's 'renaissance.' 'If the people don't want me, they don't have to vote for me. I realize I have baggage,' he said during a break in his show. 'They know who I am. They know what I am. And they know what I've accomplished.' Cianci's announcement came shortly before the 4 p.m. filing deadline; a surrogate filed his paperwork for him at City Hall. He will take a leave from the show and from his duties as a local television commentator during the campaign. Cianci previously won office as a Republican and independent. New gig: Cianci has worked as a radio broadcaster since his release from federal prison in 2007. Popular: Despite his felony convictions, Cianci has remained a popular politician in Providence. He was diagnosed in January with cancer and has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but says his health is good now and won't keep him from running a campaign or the city. Under his watch, the city transformed from a down-at-the-heels urban center with a dwindling downtown to an arts and culture hub. He often boasts that he literally moved rivers to improve the downtown. Supporters had urged him to run to bring his vision and attitude back to City Hall, but many residents feared a run by a man who was driven from office twice by felony convictions would embarrass the city. Cianci mounted his first campaign in 1974 and never lost an election. But he was forced to resign in 1984, after he was convicted of using a fireplace log and lit cigarette to assault a man he believed was having an affair with his estranged wife. Six years after that conviction, in 1990, he ran for mayor again and won. His second stint as mayor, known around town as Buddy II, came to an end in 2002 when he was convicted as part of a federal investigation into corruption in City Hall, called Operation Plunderdome by the FBI. Several other members of his administration were also convicted. Nice 'do: Cianci used to wear a tupee but recently ditched it and embraced his bald head. The city's demographics have changed since Cianci last won election. Its Hispanic population grew nearly one-third between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics represented 38 percent of the population in 2010. The city usually votes heavily Democratic. A crowded field of candidates is vying to replace one-term Mayor Angel Taveras, who is mounting a run for governor. Democrats running include City Councilman Michael Solomon, political operative Brett Smiley and law professor and former judge Jorge Elorza. Republican Dan Harrop is also running. Lorne Adrain filed as an independent. A few of the candidates issued immediate statements reacting to Cianci's entry. 'Providence cannot afford to return to the corrupt politics of the past, and that is what Buddy Cianci's candidacy represents,' Smiley said. Solomon said he — not Cianci — is the candidate of experience, having worked in recent years with Taveras to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. He said voters want to 'keep moving forward.' Adrain said Cianci's announcement won't affect his campaign. 'The people of Providence are well familiar with his history,' he said.

Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!

However, if these water droplets do not undergo the necessary temperature drop to turn into ice crystals, there won't necessarily be an increase in snowfall. In fact, an abundance of water droplets in the cloud may lead to them merging together to form bigger droplets, which may result in other precipitation types such as rain. Indirect effect: The increased water content in the sky could contribute to changes in the local weather and climate. For example, it may lead to more cloud coverage, which could trap heat and thus indirectly impact the air temperature. In this case, if temperatures remain above freezing levels due to the additional moisture and trapped heat, it could lead to less snowfall.

The answer is:","output":"Louis David Brandeis was born on November 13, 1856, in Louisville, Kentucky. He was destined to become one of the most influential and renowned figures in American legal history. After completing his early education, Brandeis went on to enroll in Harvard Law School, where he excelled academically and eventually earned his degree. On a personal front, Brandeis married his wife, Alice Goldmark, in 1891. Together, they formed a strong partnership, supporting each other throughout their lives. Brandeis remained a devout practitioner of Judaism, with his faith playing a profound role in shaping his worldview. His legal career took off as he became known for his dedication to social justice and his ability to use law as a means of effectuating change. Brandeis's impressive professional background and strong ideals caught the attention of President Woodrow Wilson, who nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1916. This nomination was met with both praise and controversy. Louis Brandeis was confirmed as Associate Justice by the Senate on June 1, 1916. His appointment was groundbreaking in several ways, making him the first Jewish justice ever to serve on the nation's highest court. This was a significant milestone that demonstrated the shifting tides of American inclusion and diversity. Brandeis took the oath of office and officially assumed his position on the bench. His predecessor, Joseph Rucker Lamar, made way for Brandeis, who would hold the post for more than two decades. Over the course of his tenure, he forged an illustrious reputation for his keen intellect, commitment to civil liberties, and his vision of progressive reform. Despite the many challenges and criticisms that came his way, Justice Brandeis remained steadfast in his pursuit of fairness, equality, and social justice. As an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, he contributed powerfully to the shaping of American jurisprudence through countless landmark cases and rulings. Ultimately, after serving on the Supreme Court for nearly 23 years, the venerable Louis D. Brandeis announced his retirement on February 13, 1939. He was later succeeded by Justice William O. Douglas, who took over the mantle and continued the work of his esteemed predecessor. Louis Brandeis passed away on October 5, 1941, in Washington, D.C. His legacy as a trailblazing justice and a tireless advocate for social change has had a lasting impact on American society. To this day, he is remembered and celebrated not just for the groundbreaking nature of his appointment but also for the depth of his commitment to creating a more equitable and just nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Brooklyn Bridge was the first suspension bridge to link Brooklyn to Manhanttan.It is also the second oldest bridge in New York.The architect was John Augustus Roebling,who was the chief engineer of the suspended Railroad Bridge at Niagara Falls.

OPT: (i) no (ii) yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Yes, the answer to both questions would essentially be the same, as they both pertain to the reasons behind the removal of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons. However, it is important to note that Ratan Tata, as an individual, didn't single-handedly remove Cyrus Mistry. It was a collective decision by the Tata Sons Board, of which Ratan Tata is a prominent member. Cyrus Mistry's removal as the chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016 was a result of multiple factors, which can be broadly categorized into two areas: performance issues and differences in management style. 1. Performance issues: During Cyrus Mistry's tenure as chairman, the group's overall financial performance was considered to be underwhelming. Some of the key concerns were: a. Poor profitability: During Mistry's four-year tenure, the group's profit margin and market capitalization took a hit. Some of the group's businesses, such as Tata Motors, Tata Steel Europe, and Tata Teleservices, faced significant financial difficulties. b. Lack of strategic growth: There was concern regarding Mistry's ability to drive growth through strategic acquisitions and expansion plans. The critics pointed at Tata Motors' unsuccessful acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover and the stalled divestiture of Tata Steel Europe as examples. c. Rising debt: Under Mistry's leadership, the group's consolidated debt increased, raising concerns about its financial stability.  2. Differences in management style: Cyrus Mistry's management approach was considered to be incompatible with the group's values and ethos. Some of the reasons cited were: a. Focus on select businesses: Mistry's strategy was to consolidate the conglomerate and focus more on a few key business segments. This led to tensions with the board, as it was seen as diverging from the group's core value – the commitment to a diversified business portfolio. b. Governance issues: Mistry was often critical of Ratan Tata's decision-making and business strategies, while accusing the Tata Trusts, the largest shareholder in Tata Sons, of interference in the functioning of the operating companies. This tension created friction between the Tata Trusts and the management. c. Lack of interpersonal skills: Cyrus Mistry was criticized for his communication and public relations skills, which some considered detrimental to the overall functioning of the group. These cumulative factors led to the loss of confidence in Cyrus Mistry, resulting in the Tata Sons Board's decision to remove him as chairman. Ratan Tata played a significant role in the process, partially due to his position as the Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons and his strong involvement with the Tata Trusts. However, it is important to emphasize that the decision was ultimately taken by the Tata Sons Board, not Ratan Tata alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is a non-profit and the story has been corrected.      The White House on Tuesday formally requested 3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to deal with an influx of Central American minors along the southern border. But the proposal was quickly met with broad skepticism among Republican lawmakers, who were doubtful that the package would be approved quickly — if at all.      Administration officials said the request is part of a comprehensive strategy aimed at building more detention centers, adding immigration judges, and beefing up border patrols and air surveillance. President Obama has said he hopes such steps will speed deportations and discourage adults from sending children on a dangerous, sometimes deadly, trip north.      But GOP leaders, who have called on Obama to take stronger action, said they were reluctant to give the administration a “blank check” without ­more-detailed plans to ensure that the money would help stem the crisis at the border.      The president “is asking to use billions of taxpayer dollars without accountability or a plan in place to actually stop the border crisis,” Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.      Asked if he thought lawmakers would approve the proposal, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said, “No, given the mood here in Washington, I don’t have confidence it will happen.”      View Graphic White House requests 3.7 billion      The uncertainty on Capitol Hill casts doubt on whether the administration can mount a successful response to a surge of tens of thousands of children who have overwhelmed Border Patrol stations in recent months.      More than 52,000 unaccompanied minors and 39,000 women with children have been apprehended on the southern border this year, far more than in past years. Most have come from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras; those countries would receive money under Obama’s proposal to help repatriate their citizens after they are returned home.      The request comes just days after Obama announced that he was giving up on a year-long effort to persuade House Republicans to support a comprehensive immigration bill. The president said he would take executive actions to reform border-control laws on his own — a declaration that angered the GOP.      The toxic environment on the Hill, combined with the looming midterm elections this fall, has contributed to the sense among Democrats and Republicans that a deal on emergency funding is unlikely, even though both sides say they agree with the White House that the crisis is urgent.      “What we would like Congress to do is to act promptly, maybe even expeditiously, to consider this proposal and hopefully move on it in bipartisan fashion,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest.      A spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said the House Appropriations Committee and a separate working group of seven Republicans focused on border issues would review the administration’s proposal.      “The speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas — which this proposal does not address,” spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement.      Immigration advocates are urging President Obama to come up with another solution besides sending young children back to their home countries. The demonstration comes as an influx of Central American children are illegally crossing into the United States. (Theresa Poulson/The Washington Post)      The rift between the parties hinges on a fundamental disagreement over how the crisis should be handled. Republicans argue that Obama must stop the flow of illegal immigrants to the border and ensure that the entire border is secure before focusing on the tens of thousands who are already in detention facilities there.      Citing that logic, Heritage Action, a conservative non-profit that closely monitors how Republican lawmakers vote, decried the Obama funding proposal as a “non-starter.”      Heritage Action’s chief executive, Michael A. Needham, said in a statement that the proposal “seeks to address the symptoms, not the cause. The president should rescind his anti-enforcement policies and demonstrate a commitment to implementing existing law.”      Democrats, meanwhile, say the first step must be new facilities and legal services to work through a debilitating backlog of minors and families already apprehended at the border.      “The process I don’t think is the problem,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). “I think it is a real crisis. Lives are going to be lost and mistakes are going to be made, so I think this supplemental is really all-important.”      Under the White House proposal, most of the emergency funds would be split between the Department of Health and Human Services — which would receive 1.8 billion to provide shelter and care to the immigrants — and the Justice and Homeland Security departments, which would get a combined 1.6 billion to handle enforcement.      The State Department would receive 300 million to help the Central American countries repatriate their citizens and create advertising campaigns about the dangers of placing children in the hands of smuggling cartels. The White House request also includes money to help the federal government fight wildfires.      “I commend the administration for doing what it can to quickly address this surge of children and families attempting to enter our country, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to support it,” Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a statement.      Republicans criticized the administration for not including measures to amend a 2008 anti-human-trafficking law that provides greater legal protections for minors entering the United States from non-border countries. The Obama administration had signaled last week that it would pursue such changes in order to deport Central American minors more quickly.      “I just think the average American will say that if you don’t deport these children, others are going to keep coming,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said. “The 2008 law was not designed to address this situation. . . . I think you take the 2008 law and you come up with a law that will address this situation.”      Earnest said Tuesday that the administration will work with lawmakers on proposals to amend that law. But Democrats and immigrant rights advocates have sharply condemned proposed changes, fearing that migrants will be returned to dangerous situations in their home nations.      Obama left Washington on Tuesday evening for a trip to Denver, Dallas and Austin, where he will attend several Democratic fundraisers and talk about the economy. Administration aides said that he will not visit the border while in Texas but that he will meet with local leaders, including Gov. Rick Perry (R), to discuss the crisis.      “If it’s serious enough for him to send a 3.7 billion funding request to us, I would think it would be serious enough for him to take an hour of his time on Air Force One to go down and see for himself what the conditions are,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) told reporters Tuesday. “I think it would be instructive for him.”      Ed O’Keefe and Katie Zezima contributed to this report. ||||| The Obama administration on Tuesday asked Congress for 3.7 billion in emergency funding to address the wave of child immigrants crossing the southwest border.      The figure is much bigger than the 2 billion that administration officials initially floated, and the total 4.3 billion package also includes a request for 615 million for the Department of Agriculture to fight wildfires in the West.      THE WHITE HOUSE      Office of the Press Secretary      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      July 8, 2014      FACT SHEET: Emergency Supplemental Request to Address the Increase in Child and Adult Migration from Central America in the Rio Grande Valley Areas of the Southwest Border      While overall rates of apprehensions across our Southwest border remain at near historic lows, apprehensions and processing of children and individuals from Central America crossing the border in the Rio Grande Valley have continued at high rates. The Administration continues to address this urgent humanitarian situation with a whole-of government response which includes efforts by the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ) to deploy additional enforcement resources -- including immigration judges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorneys, and asylum officers -- to focus on individuals and adults traveling with children from Central America and entering without authorization across the Southwest border. Part of this surge includes detention of adults traveling with children, as well as expanded use of the Alternatives to Detention program, to avoid a more significant humanitarian situation. DHS is working to secure additional space that satisfies applicable legal and humanitarian standards for detention of adults with children. This surge of resources means that cases are processed fairly and as quickly as possible, ensuring the protection of asylum seekers and refugees while enabling the prompt removal of individuals who do not qualify for asylum or other forms of relief from removal. Finally, to attack the criminal organizations and smuggling rings that are exploiting these individuals, agencies are surging law enforcement task forces in cooperation with our international partners, with a focus on stepped-up interdiction and prosecution.      Under the President’s direction, the Administration also continues to work closely with our Mexican and Central American partners to address the root causes of this problem, stem the flow of adults and unaccompanied children into the United States, and expand capacity to receive and reintegrate repatriated migrants. Following the Vice President’s June 20 meeting with leaders from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, to discuss our shared responsibility for promoting security, these countries committed to working together and with the United States to address the immediate humanitarian situation as well as the long-term challenges. Secretary Kerry met with leaders from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras on July 1st in Panama, and in his remarks highlighted some of the challenges driving migration, the importance of applying the law and combating misinformation, and working together with Central American partners to address these challenges. We are working with our Central American partners, nongovernmental organizations, and other influential voices to send a clear message to potential migrants so that they understand the significant dangers of this journey and to make clear that they are not eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals process or earned citizenship provisions that are part of comprehensive immigration reform pending in the Congress. As part of this effort, we have also committed foreign assistance resources to improve capacity of these countries to receive and reintegrate returned individuals and address the underlying security and economic issues that cause migration.      While the Administration is working across all of these channels, we are eager to work with the Congress to ensure that sufficient resources and authorities exist to continue our efforts. That is why today the President is requesting a 3.7 billion supplemental appropriation focused on:      · Deterrence, including increased detainment and removal of adults with children and increased immigration court capacity to speed cases      · Enforcement, including enhanced interdiction and prosecution of criminal networks, increased surveillance, and expanded collaborative law enforcement task force efforts      · Foreign Cooperation, including improved repatriation and reintegration, stepped-up public information campaigns, and efforts to address the root causes of migration      · Capacity, including increased detainment, care, and transportation of unaccompanied children      The supplemental appropriation broken down below would fund activities at the Departments of, Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), State and other International Programs, and Health and Human Services (HHS).      The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - 1.1 billion      This proposal would provide the Department of Homeland Security a total of 1.1 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Of this total:      · 116 million would pay for transportation costs associated with the significant rise in apprehensions of unaccompanied children;      · 109 million would provide for immigration and customs enforcement efforts, including expanding the Border Enforcement Security Task Force program, doubling the size of vetted units in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and expanding investigatory activities by ICE Homeland Security Investigations; and      · 879 million would pay for detention and removal of apprehended undocumented adults traveling with children, expansion of alternatives to detention programs for these individuals, and additional prosecution capacity for adults with children who cross the border unlawfully.      The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection - 433 million      This proposal would provide the Department of Homeland Security a total of 433 million for Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Of this total:      · 364 million would pay for operational costs of responding to the significant rise in apprehensions of unaccompanied children and families, including overtime and temporary duty costs for Border Patrol agents, contract services and facility costs to care for children while in CBP custody, and medical and transportation service arrangements;      · 29 million for CBP to expand its role in Border Enforcement Security Task Force programs, increasing information-sharing and collaboration among the participating law enforcement agencies combatting transnational crime; and      · 39.4 million to increase air surveillance capabilities that would support 16,526 additional flight hours for border surveillance and 16 additional crews for unmanned aerial systems to improve detection and interdiction of illegal activity.      The Department of Justice - 64 million      This proposal would provide the Department of Justice a total of 64 million. Of the total:      · 45.4 million would be to hire approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams, including those anticipated to be hired on a temporary basis. This funding would also expand courtroom capacity including additional video conferencing and other equipment in support of the additional immigration judge teams. These additional resources, when combined with the FY 2015 Budget request for 35 additional teams, would provide sufficient capacity to process an additional 55,000 to 75,000 cases annually.      · 2.5 million would be used to expand the legal orientation program that provides assistance to adults and custodians of children in the immigration court system.      · 15 million to provide direct legal representation services to children in immigration proceedings.      · 1.1 million to hire additional immigration litigation attorneys to support Federal agencies involved in detainee admission, regulation, and removal actions.      Department of State and Other International Programs - 300 million      This proposal would provide 300 million to the Department of State. Of the total:      · 295 million would support efforts to repatriate and reintegrate migrants to Central America, to help the governments in the region better control their borders, and to address the underlying root causes driving migration, i.e. creating the economic, social, governance, and citizen security conditions to address factors that are contributing to significant increases in migration to the United States. Beyond initial assistance, continued funding for repatriation and reintegration activities will be contingent on sustained progress and cooperation by the Central American countries.      · 5 million would support State Department media campaigns in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, targeting potential migrants and their families. The campaigns will emphasize the dangers of the journey, deliver the message that unaccompanied children are not given a permit to stay in the U.S., and highlight a shared community responsibility for the welfare of unaccompanied children. Funds would also support youth programs to develop skills and leadership among potential migrants.      The Department of Health and Human Services - 1.8 billion      This proposal would provide an additional 1.8 billion for HHS to provide the appropriate care for unaccompanied children, consistent with Federal law, while maintaining services for refugees. With these funds, HHS will have the resources to be able to care for the children currently projected to come into the custody of the Department of Homeland Security while putting in place more stable, cost-effective arrangements for these children going forward. The proposal would also support the ongoing HHS medical response activities for unaccompanied children to address the surge at Border Patrol facilities.      Without supplemental funding, absent undertaking extraordinary measures, agencies will not have sufficient resources to adequately address this situation. HHS will be unable to address the influx of children by securing sufficient shelter capacity with the number of children held at Border Patrol stations continuing to increase, for longer periods of time. Going forward, HHS will be unable to set-up more stable, cost-effective arrangements for these children, Border Patrol agents will have to be re-assigned to child care duties from their border security work, and ICE will lack the resources needed to sufficiently expand detention and removal capacity for adults with children who cross the border illegally. In addition, without additional funds, DOJ will be unable to keep pace with its growing caseload, leading to longer wait times for those cases already on the docket. And absent dedicated resources in Central American countries, we will not make progress on the larger drivers of this humanitarian crisis. For these reasons, supplemental resources are urgently needed to continue forward with the aggressive response that the Administration has deployed to date.      #      Read more from The Hill:      Obama wants 3.7B for border      Read letter from the president ||||| The administration on Tuesday asked Congress for 3.7 billion in emergency funding to address the wave of child immigrants crossing the Southwest border.      The figure is much more than the 2 billion that was initially reported. The overall package totals 4.3 billion, and also includes a request for 615 million for the Department of Agriculture to fight wildfires in the West. [READ WHITE HOUSE FACT SHEET.]      Administration officials had said the request would be more than 2 billion, but had not suggested it would be nearly double that amount.      The White House cast the request as part of an aggressive response to the border crisis, which has become a political problem for the administration months before the midterm elections. [READ PRESIDENT'S LETTER TO SPEAKER.]      ADVERTISEMENT “If you look at the details, what you see is an embodiment of the incredibly serious commitment that the president has to addressing the situation,” one White House official said on Tuesday.      The request includes 1.8 billion for the Health and Human Services Department to provide “appropriate care” for the children, who are mostly coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.      It also includes 1.1 billion for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The funding would help expand border security task forces and help pay for transportation costs associated with the rise in unaccompanied children.      The package could be controversial with Republicans, who have argued the administration’s policies are encouraging an unprecedented wave of child immigrants. They have pointed to President Obama’s decision not to deport certain children who were brought to the U.S. as illegal immigrants.      Republicans have also pressed Obama to send the National Guard to the border.      Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Tuesday that the Appropriations Committee and other members — including the working group on the border crisis led by Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas) — will review the administration's proposal.      \\"The Speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas, which this proposal does not address,\\" Steel said.      At the White House briefing on Tuesday, press secretary Josh Earnest disputed Boehner's concern about border agents, saying that immigrants who are entering the country without authorization \\"aren't seeking to evade detection\\" by law enforcement officials.      \\"Rather, these individuals are seeking out these Border Patrol agents with the expectation they'll be detained and in the hope that they'll be allowed to remain in the country,\\" he said. Earnest said he hopes Congress will act \\"promptly and even expeditiously\\" on the supplemental.      \\"With emergency requests like this traditional Congress has not sought to bog it down with a search for offsets,\\" Earnest said.      The administration has acknowledged that many of the people entering the country believe they will be allowed to stay, and has said it is working to counter those misperceptions.      The White House took its toughest line yet Monday, with Obama spokesman Josh Earnest saying most of the children would not be allowed to stay in the United States.      Administration officials have said that many of the new immigrants are entering the United States to escape violence in their home countries.      U.S. officials have been ill-equipped to handle the wave of new immigrants, who have crowded into detention centers. Immigrants have been bussed to other centers in California, where there have been some high-profile protests.      Some of the funding request would be used to speed up immigration trials so that people could be deported more quickly. Many of the new immigrants are released to the care of relatives while they await court hearings.      The request also includes 433 million to go toward additional resources for border agents, including overtime and \\"temporary duty costs\\" for border agents as well as an increase in air surveillance capabilities. The Department of Justice would receive 64 million to hire approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams, White House officials say.      The administration is seeking Congressional discretion on at least one element of the plan: \\"We are seeking a greater authority for the secretary of Homeland Security to exercise greater discretion that would allow him to more efficiently and effectively remove and repatriate immigrants to this country that don't have a legal basis for remaining here,\\" Earnest said.      The White House says more than 52,000 unaccompanied children have attempted to cross the border since October.      The president will travel to Texas on Thursday but administration officials say he will not visit the border while he is there. Instead, he plans to address the issue in a meeting with local leaders. The White House has invited Texas Gov. Rick Perry to also take part in the meeting.      Speaking about this crisis on Tuesday, White House officials say Obama believes the wave of immigrants is an “urgent humanitarian situation.” The officials said the administration is focused on making sure the children have proper care “but plan to enforce the law.”      Administration officials say they are hopeful Congress will approve the president's request.      “Our hope and expectation ... is that this will be treated as the urgent humanitarian situation that it is,” one White House official said.      —This story was posted at 11:36 a.m. and updated at 1:44 p.m. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The White House has requested 3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to deal with an influx of Central American minors along the southern border.

There are three options provided: Option 1: Yes Option 2: It is not possible to tell Option 3: No To analyze these options, let's break down the given information: The premise provides us with three distinct pieces of information: 1. There are people present. 2. These people are under a blue umbrella. 3. These people are walking. Now, let's compare this information to our hypothesis: \\"People are walking.\\" Our hypothesis aligns with the third piece of information provided in the premise - it directly states that people are walking. Option 1: Yes If the premise is true, meaning people are indeed under a blue umbrella and walking, then the hypothesis can be considered true as well. The given information in the premise supports the statement made in the hypothesis. Option 2: It is not possible to tell In this scenario, the suggestion is that the provided premise doesn't offer enough evidence to convincingly confirm or refute the hypothesis. However, as we have seen in the analysis above, the premise does provide information directly correlating to the hypothesis - people are walking. Option 3: No This option would suggest that even if the premise is true, it doesn't confirm the hypothesis. But upon analyzing the premise, we can see that it includes the fact that people are walking, which aligns with the hypothesis directly.

Q:When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night.

What is the best way to: To remove gum from your hair.","output":"The best way to remove gum from your hair involves the following steps: Step 1: Remain calm - When you realize there's gum in your hair, don't panic or start pulling on it which can worsen the situation. Instead, calmly assess the situation and decide on the best course of action. Step 2: Gather materials - To effectively remove gum from your hair, you will need some items that help dissolve the gum's stickiness. Common household items that might work well include oil-based products like cooking oil, peanut butter or conditioner, ice cubes, a fine-tooth comb, and a towel or cloth. Step 3: Apply chosen substance - Choose one of the oil-based substances like cooking oil, peanut butter, or conditioner. Apply a generous amount directly onto the gum and surrounding hair using a cloth, or your fingers. The more lubricated the gum becomes, the easier it will be to remove. Step 4: Loosen the gum - Once the substance is applied, gently work it into the gum and surrounding hair. As the gum starts to lose its stickiness, it should begin to slide off the hair strands more easily. Step 5: Use a fine-tooth comb - Hold the hair above the gum so you don't pull on the roots or further tangle the hair. Then, gently slide a fine-tooth comb through the affected hair, starting close to the gum and working your way down the hair strands. Be patient and avoid using excessive force; doing so may cause further damage to the hair. Step 6: Repeat as needed - If the gum is still not fully removed, repeat the above steps until the gum is completely gone. Depending on how large the gum is or how tangled it is in the hair, this process may take several attempts. Step 7: Wash your hair - Once the gum is removed, you'll want to get rid of any remaining residue. Wash your hair thoroughly using your regular shampoo, and then condition to help detangle and restore the hair's natural softness. Step 8: Dry and style - Gently towel-dry your hair and apply a leave-in conditioner if necessary to prevent and repair any damage caused during the gum removal process. Then, style your hair as usual, being mindful of the previously affected area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Question: Who leads his army to victory and destory the city of york.? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Braveheart Context: In 1280, King Edward \\"Longshanks\\" (Patrick McGoohan) invades and conquers Scotland following the death of Alexander III of Scotland, who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace (James Robinson) witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father (Sean Lawlor) and brother (Sandy Nelson), and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England. Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at Stirling and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew (Richard Leaf) and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), the son of nobleman Robert the Elder (Ian Bannen) and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife Isabella of France (Sophie Marceau) to try to negotiate with Wallace. After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country. Leading the English army...

Fact: as the supply of food in an environment decreases , the population of animals in that environment will decrease Question: Predators which rely on small rodents for food will do what when rodents all die off? What's the answer?","output":"When the population of small rodents, which are a primary food source for many predators, significantly declines or completely dies off, the predators relying on them will have to adapt to the situation in various ways in order to survive. This adaptation can manifest itself through several potential behavioral and ecological changes. Some of the potential outcomes include: 1. Change in diet: One of the more immediate adaptive responses by predators is to shift their diet to alternative prey, either by choosing other smaller animals such as insects and birds or by switching to larger prey options like rabbits, hares, or even other small predators. This can result in a change in hunting strategies and may lead to alterations in the predator's physical adaptations over time, as they hone new skills and techniques for catching and consuming different prey. 2. Decreased population: If a predator species is unable to adapt its diet sufficiently to compensate for the loss of small rodents, it may experience a decrease in its population, similar to the decline seen in the prey population. This process, termed density-dependent population regulation, occurs due to increased competition for the remaining available resources among the predator population. As weaker or less adaptable individuals struggle more to find food, their survival and reproduction rates decline, translating into a smaller overall population in the related environment. 3. Migration: As food resources dwindle, some predators may choose to leave their original habitat in search of a more abundant food source. This migration can lead to new territories being explored and conquered. However, it can also result in heavy competition within the new territory, as these predators might face direct competition from other predators adapted to that environment. 4. Behavioral changes: Predators that rely on small rodents for food may change their social and hunting behaviors as they search for other viable food sources. For example, solitary predators may be forced to cooperate with other members of their species, forming loose hunting parties to increase their chances of catching larger or more elusive prey. Additionally, nocturnal predators might expand their activity to daylight hours in hopes of increasing the opportunities to acquire food. 5. Evolutionary adaptation: Over an extended period, predator populations may undergo evolutionary adaptations to better suit their new dietary habits or lifestyles. Such adaptations can include physiological changes to improve the predator's ability to process new types of food or physical alterations to enhance their ability to catch and subdue a different variety of prey. These adaptations are significant when considering long-term shifts in predator-prey relationships within an ecosystem. In summary, when small rodents, the primary food source for many predators, decline or die off, predators will need to respond adaptively by changing their diet, enduring population decreases, migrating to more favorable environments, altering their behaviors, or undergoing long-term evolutionary adaptations. The specific response of each predator will depend on factors such as the species' biology, ecological niche, and the availability of alternative prey within the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including...","output":"David Bowie appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.  - Branimir ( Latin : Brannimero ) was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia who reigned as duke ( knez ) from 879 to 892 . His country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879 . During his reign , Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent .  - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\".  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.    What entity does 'branimir of croatia' has the relation 'religion' with?","output":"Branimir of Croatia has a relation with the Catholic Church in terms of religion. He was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia and reigned as a duke from 879 to 892. During Branimir's reign, Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent. Importantly, his country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879. This recognition established a connection between Branimir's Croatia and the Catholic Church, solidifying their relationship in terms of religion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos.

Lastly, the reference to \\"Jackass: The Movie\\" as evidence to support the speaker's claim suggests that the speaker views the film as emblematic of the undesirable aspects of the contemporary culture. Therefore, by connecting the movie to the decline of society, the speaker displays a negative sentiment towards both the film and the current state of culture.

Learn what different places specialize in and shop for different foods at the right place.  Chain groceries and box stores like Safeway, Kroger, Sainsbury's, and Woolworth's, Tesco, New World, etc specialize in affordable perishable and nonperishable food. Box stores like Walmart, Meijer, Target, and other chains also have grocery sections that are expansive and usually cheap. These are good places to visit for name-brand goods and find deals. Natural groceries and specialty vendors may be the best place to visit for local produce, fresh vegetables, and raw ingredients, but they tend to be more expensive than chain stores. You're paying for quality. Food cooperatives are common in some places, allowing you to buy in to a partial ownership of the store and decide what should be stocked. If required, check out bulk suppliers - these used to be called Cash and Carry. You may need to buy a membership card, but you could save money if you need to buy food in bulk. Corner stores, convenience stores, dairies and local shops are good places for prepared food, snacks, and alcohol, but not great places to find fresh vegetables or fruits unless you have no other option. Grocery outlets supply overstocked off-brand food that can be purchased for much cheaper than at regular grocery stores. Amelia's and ALDI are common examples of this, offering a somewhat limited variety of fresh and non-perishable foods for much cheaper than at the bigger stores. You don't have the same variety, so it's not the place to go looking for super-specific ingredients, but it's a good place to find staples, like cooking oil, sugar, or vinegar. It's also a good place for things like snack crackers, bread, and other off-brand goods. By far where practical, the best place to find quality produce where you live is to find out about local farmers' markets. Typically held on weekends, farmers' markets combine a festival-like atmosphere with outdoor stalls and extremely fresh produce. Depending on the climate, this might only happen during the harvest season, but some markets go year-round in certain climates. These are excellent places to get fresh fruits, organic vegetables, and local meat raised in a humane way.  Markets also give you a chance to see and interact with the people who grow, prepare, and sell your food. It's a lot more personal than buying cookies at the corner store. Markets are also a good place to find out about Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) in your area, if applicable. Many booths may offer CSA packages, which allow you to buy into the farm, essentially paying an up-front or a monthly price for a package of fresh vegetables that you can pick up or have delivered. Like anything, it's also possible to buy certain specialty ingredients online and have it delivered. This can be an excellent choice if you live somewhere very remote and struggle to find access to certain ingredients or fresh supplies in your area. Everything from organic gummy bears to bulk bags of caraway seeds and jasmine rice can be had for decent prices online.  Coffee co-ops are very popular online options, letting you buy in and \\"subscribe\\" to a coffee club that will deliver high-quality whole beans directly to your door. If you're a coffee-food eater, it's a no-brainer. Citrus delivery doesn't have to be reserved for Christmas-time. Since citrus can only grow in limited climates, having high-quality oranges, grapefruits, lemons and limes delivered straight to your door is another great option if this happens where you live. Increasingly, stores are charging for the use of plastic or paper bags, making it much more cost-effective to buy one and take it with you when food shopping. It's also cutting down a lot on waste to get rid of those 20 useless plastic bags that come home with you every time you head to the store. Invest in five or six good quality tote-bags and keep them in your car, or near the front door so you'll remember them when you head to the store. o to a restaurant. Sometimes, you just don't feel like cooking. While it's usually more cost-effective to cook meals at home and get more bang for your buck, if you're solo it can be a whole lot easier buy food buy going out for a sandwich than to buy a bunch of ingredients to cook at home. One always-easy way of buying food is to buy it already made at the restaurant. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, when stocking up on food, it is essential to consider different types of vendors to find the most suitable options based on individual needs. Chain groceries and box stores offer affordable perishable and non-perishable food options, while natural groceries and specialty vendors provide fresh, local produce and raw ingredients but can be more expensive. Food cooperatives allow partial ownership, while bulk suppliers and grocery outlets offer the opportunity to save money on larger or overstocked purchases. Corner stores and convenience stores mainly provide prepared food, snacks, and alcohol. Farmer's markets are an excellent source of fresh, local produce, and online shopping offers access to specialty ingredients and subscription services. Adopting reusable shopping bags can reduce waste and save money in the long run. Lastly, eating at restaurants can be a convenient option when home cooking is not desirable."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They suspect the palace's owner, Joseph Curwen, is a warlock. A young girl wanders up to the palace in a trance-like state. She is led by Curwen and his mistress, Hester, down into the dungeons. The girl is subjected to a strange ritual, in which an unseen creature rises up from a covered pit. The townspeople observe the girl wandering off, and they storm the palace to confront its owner. Though the girl appears unharmed, the townspeople surmise that she has been bewitched to forget what happened to her. They drag Curwen out to a tree where they intend to burn him. The mob leader, Ezra Weeden, insists that they do not harm Hester (to whom he had been previously engaged to marry). Before being burned alive, Curwen puts a curse on Arkham and its inhabitants and their descendants, promising to rise from the grave to take his revenge. In 1875, 110 years later, Curwen's great-great-grandson, Charles Dexter Ward, and his wife Anne arrive in Arkham after inheriting the palace. They find the townsfolk hostile towards them and are disturbed by the horrific deformities that afflict many of Arkham's inhabitants. Charles is surprised by how well he seems to know the palace and struck by his strong resemblance to a portrait of Curwen. He and Anne meet Simon, the palace caretaker, who persuades them to stay at the palace and to forget the townspeoples' hostility.

Answer: A:","output":"Based on the given review, it is evident that the user holds a high regard for Luis Miguel as a complete artist, showcasing both an exceptional voice and 'charm.' They appreciate his talents and express their genuine admiration for him. However, the user also highlights the dominance of the American English influence, which, according to them, often prevents non-English speaking artists like Luis Miguel from showcasing their skills and growing in the industry.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. School is filled with distractions, from your friends to sports and parties, and once you get to college no one will call your parents if you skip class. But try to make academics your priority. You won’t be an honors student if you are chronically absent. You cannot excel if you aren't there to learn and discuss the material.  Many honors courses have additional requirements, such as class participation or class discussion. If you miss class, you miss out on this part of your grade. A good circle of friends or study partners can hold you accountable. Consider making a deal with your study-buddies to keep each other in class. Schools usually have resources available to help you reach your highest potential. You just have to ask. It should be possible to find a study group, for example, and some schools even have special centers for tutoring in subjects like math. Be aware of what's available.  Talk with your teacher if you're having difficulty, or you'd just like to understand a topic more clearly. As long as it's not an hour before the test, most teachers are happy to answer your questions. Join a peer tutoring program if you need more intensive one-on-one help. Peer tutors know their stuff -- you have to do well in a subject in order to become one. They can guide you through assignments and major concepts, build up your base of knowledge, or help you prepare for an upcoming exam. Don't despair if your school doesn't offer these resources. It's always possible to form your own study circle. But be careful if your study circle consists only of close friends. Minimize your distractions and remember to hit those books! You forget 47% of the information you encounter within twenty minutes. You forget 68% in a day.Take good notes for every subject in order to remember what you’ve covered in reading and lectures for later review.  Taking notes is an art form. It will take you some time to learn how to listen and read effectively and identify the most important things. Oftentimes school writing centers offer students tips for this.  How you take notes – whether by computer or hand – is up to you. Studies suggest that taking notes by hand is better for comprehension and recall, though. Some (but not all) teachers are also fine with students recording them in class. Just make sure to ask for their permission beforehand. Many honor students like using the Cornell method, which involves taking notes during class and then later returning to them to review and condense. This method is great for courses that cover clearly-defined subjects, such as math, science, and history. It is less useful for more abstract courses that focus less on memorization and recall, such as a discussion-heavy literature course. Whether essays, lab reports, or problem sets, assignments will usually make up a big part of your total grade in a course. Missing just one might mean a reduction in your final mark. It might mean more. It can be the difference between a final B+ and an A.  There are also reasons to do your homework besides just the grades. Studies have shown that completing your homework is linked to higher achievement and to the development of skills like time management, responsibility, and good study habits.  Turn in your assignments early when possible. If your paper is due online at midnight, it's practically a guarantee that there will be a dozen students trying to upload it at 11:59, which could cause system crashes. Do your assignments as soon as possible, and definitely turn them in early when you can.  A strong history of turning in your assignments on time also makes teachers more likely to be flexible if you have a genuine emergency. If you've only turned in a third of your homework to start with, though, your teacher is unlikely to be impressed by your excellent excuse for not doing it this time. While it's usually a good thing to study with classmates, there can be a thin line between cooperating and cheating. Your teachers will expect you to hand in your own work. If you aren't clear on what's acceptable, talk with your teacher beforehand.  Be especially careful when it comes to homework assignments. Unless it's a group project, it may be inappropriate to do an assignment with others. Never plagiarize. Using another person's answers, or copying words from a book or website into an essay, are forms of plagiarism and academically dishonest. Plagiarism can cause you to fail an assignment or course or even get you expelled. Being an honor student probably means hitting the books more than your peers. Review your lessons and notes at home or before class. Review with friends or alone. Review while on the bus or watching TV. You can also try as much as possible to read ahead, as this will help you to ask reasonable questions and allow you to understand new topics more easily.  Try bringing flashcards with you on the bus or public transit. You can review them while you're riding to school, or even while you're standing in line at the store. By reviewing your material in smaller chunks frequently, you're more likely to commit it to long-term memory. Many students seem to believe that they're great multitaskers. However, many studies show that multitasking, or trying to focus on several tasks at the same time, simply doesn't work. You just end up spreading your attention out thinly over several areas, rather than focusing it on one. So put the cell phone away, log off social media, and turn off the TV while you're studying. This works the other way around, too. Even the most dedicated honor student needs time to decompress and relax, or you'll burn out. Schedule in some dedicated \\"me time\\" and keep it faithfully. If you're on a half-hour break, try not to think about homework.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of prioritizing academics, attending classes, utilizing available resources and study techniques, completing assignments on time, avoiding plagiarism, and finding a balance between studying and personal time in order to become a successful honor student."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Some Christians believe that the term \\"Christian Church\\" or \\"Church\\" applies only to a specific historic Christian institution (e.g., the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy). The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed are unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity.  - The Nicene Creed (Greek: or, , Latin: \\"\\") is a Symbol of faith widely used in Christian liturgy.  - Liberatus of Carthage ( 6th century ) was an archdeacon and the author of an important history of the Nestorian and Monophysite controversies in the 5th - and 6th - century Christian Church .  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".

What is the answer: What are the members of the Unification Church commonly called?","output":"The members of the Unification Church are commonly called \\"Moonies\\" after the church's founder, Sun Myung Moon. Established in South Korea in 1954, the Unification Church has been the subject of significant controversy due to its teachings, practices, and the impact it has had on some members who have become transnationally involved in cult-like activities. Though the term \\"Moonie\\" is widely recognized and used to describe members of the organization, it has been faced with criticism as some reckon it bears derogatory connotations. The Unification Church promotes a combination of Christianity and traditional Korean beliefs, centering around the Divine Principle, which is its core theology. According to the church's teachings, Sun Myung Moon was appointed by Jesus Christ to continue the fulfillment of Christ's mission of bringing salvation and establishing a perfect world. The movement lays emphasis on the sanctity of marriage and the importance of creating ideal families. \\"Mass weddings,\\" also known as \\"Blessing ceremonies,\\" have become one of the most renowned practices within the Unification Church. These predetermined events involve the mass marriage of hundreds or even thousands of members, often from various backgrounds and nationalities. Many of these arranged marriages are conducted with little to no prior contact between future spouses, marking a departure from conventional courtship and wedding processes. The Unification Church has substantial influence beyond its religious inclinations, stretching into the realms of business, cultural events, and media outlets across the globe. The Washington Times, a US-based conservative newspaper, is one of its most well-known establishments. The organization also boasts a significant presence in Gambia, where agricultural and fishing projects have been initiated. Additionally, the church has been proactive in promoting interfaith dialogue in an attempt to foster unity among different religious groups. During its existence, the Unification Church has faced numerous challenges and controversies, including allegations of brainwashing and abducting its members. Some individuals who have left the movement have reported severe psychological trauma, detailing their difficulty in re-establishing connections to mainstream society. In response to such controversies, the organization has been widely criticized, and some countries have even restricted its activities. Despite its challenges and criticisms, the Unification Church remains an active force in the religious world, with tens of thousands of adherents scattered across various countries. Nevertheless, the term \\"Moonie\\" has persisted as a recognizable descriptor of its members and is an embodiment of the controversies and unique beliefs espoused by the organization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: My best story is about Santa Claus. A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. Question: Why was the boy upset?

Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

Let me make it simple for you! There are two ways to do this: 1. First, peel the banana and put it on a clean plate or cutting board. Then, using a small knife, carefully cut the banana into thin round slices, just like you're cutting a little circle! Make sure to ask an adult to help you! 2. The second way is to cut the banana in half lengthwise. Imagine having a long banana and cutting it into two long pieces. Then you lay the long pieces on their flat sides and cut them into thin round slices. This way, you'll still get those little circle slices for your crepes.

Rohingya have been fleeing persecution of the hard-line military regime in Myanmar. Article:","output":"Title: Rohingya Refugees Abandoned at Sea: A Dire Humanitarian Crisis Unfolds Introduction: In a shocking revelation, CNN has recently uncovered evidence that suggests hundreds of Rohingya refugees were abandoned at sea by the Thai army. These vulnerable individuals, already facing immense challenges as they flee persecution from the hard-line military regime in Myanmar, now face an uncertain fate as they are left adrift on rickety boats.  Thai Army's Involvement: According to the information gathered by CNN, photographs have surfaced that clearly show these desperate refugees on board their dilapidated boats, being towed out to sea by the Thai army before being cut loose and left to drift. This disturbing act raises critical questions about the Thai army's role in the ongoing Rohingya crisis and their apparent lack of empathy for the suffering of these vulnerable people. Thailand Government's Response: In response to these alarming revelations, the Thai government has taken the essential step of launching an official inquiry to address and investigate the matter. They aim to hold those responsible accountable and take necessary action against any individuals or factions found guilty of such inhumane actions. The Plight of the Rohingya: Hailing from Myanmar, the Rohingya people have long been victims of persecution at the hands of the nation's hard-line military regime. Violent crackdowns, killings, and forced displacement of the Rohingya have led them to seek refuge in neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia. However, the journey to safety is often riddled with hardships and dangers, including exploitation by human traffickers, violence, and now being abandoned at sea. Moving Forward: As the Thai government takes important steps to address the issue of Rohingya refugees being abandoned at sea, it is crucial for the international community to take notice of this humanitarian crisis and come together to provide support for these displaced people. Efforts must be made to ensure their safe passage to countries willing to offer them refuge and protect them from further persecution. The Rohingya people face an uphill battle in their quest for safety, and the apparent actions of the Thai army only serve to exacerbate their plight. It is imperative that the international community, humanitarian organizations, and governments across the globe work together to address the Rohingya crisis and ensure that these vulnerable people can finally find a safe haven, free from fear and persecution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute at the age of five?  Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother.  In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.  A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\".  At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922. In July 1922 she performed a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which Joseph praised her warmly, writing: \\"I think everyone enjoyed the Bach from beginning to end, they all made nice contented noises at the...

Q: But  President Donald J. Trump  hardly looked like a grand wizard a week ago today. On January 8   he  hosted Alveda King  the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Isaac Newton Farris Jr.  Dr. King’s nephew  and Bruce Levell of the National Diversity Coalition for  Trump . All three of  Trump ’s guests are black. “I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America ” Senator Paul  an ophthalmologist  said on NBC’s Meet the Press yesterday. “And when we asked  Donald J. Trump  as a private citizen to support those trips   he  was a large financial backer of both medical mission trips.” Paul continued: “I think it’s unfair then to sort of all of a sudden paint him  ‘Oh well   he ’s a racist ’ when I know  for a fact  that  he  cares very deeply about the people in Haiti because  he  helped finance a trip where we were able to get vision back for 200 people in Haiti.” Whatever  Trump  said or didn’t say  the reaction has been beyond incendiary  with the words “racist” and “racism” erupting like volcanos around the Pacific Ring of Fire.  Trump’s  alleged language  if uttered  was unfortunate  vulgar  and unpresidential  although  he  hardly would have been the first chief executive to use profanity in office.  His  supposed words apparently were aimed at sh**hole nations  rather than sh**hole people. The latter would have been inexcusable. It is widely understood that certain nations are garden spots  and others are not. It is fair to say that Haiti  El Salvador  and a tragically high number of African countries are non-garden spots. It also is perfectly appropriate to ask whether America would be better off with immigrants from such impoverished and embattled places or from prosperous nations  such as Norway  which  Trump  reportedly mentioned. It likely was top of mind  given Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg’s visit and joint press conference with him on Wednesday. Whatever he stated or didn’t   President Trump  should learn these lessons from this experience  and repeat them to  himself  daily: “Every word I say matters.” This is true in public  in private  and around the clock  until  he  leaves the White House and begins work on the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library.  Trump  should think of  himself  as Jim Carrey in the 1998 film The Truman Show. Except when  he  is in bed   Trump  should behave as if every breath  he  takes were being broadcast live around the globe.  Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals. They almost universally crave  his  failure  resist  his  program  and want to yank  him  from office — never mind the 304 votes  he  legitimately won in the Electoral College. Anything  he  says in front of Democrats (and even some Never  Trump  Republicans  alas) can and will be used against  him  in the court of public opinion.  Senator Durbin  should be condemned for publicizing (or distorting)  his  private conversation with  Trump   thus sabotaging efforts to reach a DACA deal. But this should be no more shocking than if  somewhere in Illinois  a rooster crowed at dawn.  Trump  needs to remember that Democrats are not  his  pals. Ned Ryun of American Majority has an excellent idea: Whenever  President Trump  meets with Democrats   he  should summon news cameras and let them stay until Democrats leave. Trump displayed his leadership skills to almost universal applause when he allowed the media to broadcast live for 55 minutes from the Cabinet Room  as he negotiated immigration and border security last Tuesday. Doing this regularly when Democrats are around will prevent them from offering journalists an alternative version of events. With cameras present  Trump should be on his best behavior. And the American people will benefit from Senate-floor-like transparency inside the White House. This would be unprecedented and gain Trump considerable respect for opening a virtual sunroof atop the West Wing. Trump’s job is to recall at all times  with the relentlessness of a bloodhound chasing an escaped Death Row inmate  that he must not give free knives and anvils to people who hate his guts and literally would cheer if he woke up dead tomorrow morning . (And the Left need not bother to deny this. Everyone knows this is true  as evidenced by the Left’s repeated fantasies about Trump being shot  stabbed  and decapitated.) These people would call  Trump  a racist for ordering vanilla ice cream.  He  should remember this without fail and act accordingly. If  Trump  becomes blurry about this fact   he  should remember the very first fake-news story to emerge on  his  watch. On January 20  during  his  very first day as president  Time magazine’s Zeke Miller reported that Trump removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office. This confirmed that  Trump  was a racist who couldn’t wait to evict that troublemaking black from  his  new office. A:","output":"President Donald J. Trump"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, it seems unlikely that they would just simply sleep soundly after the banging sound. Option 2: They all freaked out naturally. Considering the context of the story, the group has been playing with a Ouija board, which might make them more inclined to believe in supernatural events or at least be more prone to fear. Hearing strange noise would likely evoke such fear or general discomfort, making this option more plausible.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha?, using the article: Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together.

Allow me to explain. The phrase \\"A guitar-playing woman kisses a young girl on stage\\" has a specific set of details. It implies that there is a female who is playing the guitar, and she kisses a young girl onstage. On the other hand, \\"A female is happy to be playing\\" simply mentions that a woman is playing something (perhaps an instrument or a sport), and she is happy about playing it.  The first statement gives a clear and complete image involving a guitar, a woman, a young girl, an action (kissing), and a location (on stage). While the second statement talks about a single female who is happy but does not provide details about what she is playing, who she might interact with, or where exactly this is happening. Because the two statements don't share a sufficient amount of information, it is impossible to determine if they are related or if the current statement alone (\\"A female is happy to be playing\\") can lead to concluding the situation depicted in the first statement. There is a possibility that they might be connected, but without specific details or further context, it is inconclusive.

Step 2: Translate each part of the sentence from English to Czech. - 'Seein' is believin',':   In Czech, \\"seeing\\" is \\"vidění\\" and \\"believing\\" is \\"věření\\".

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Dr. Gridlock He was online Tuesday, Jan. 16, at 1 p.m. ET to address all your traffic and transit issues. The Dr. Gridlock column receives hundreds of letters each month from motorists and transit riders throughout the Washington region. They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief. Dr. Gridlock appears in The Post's Metro section on Sunday and in the Extra section on Thursday. His comments also appear on the Web site's Get There blog. You can send e-mails for the newspaper column to drgridlock@washpost.com or write to Dr. Gridlock at 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071. Dr. Gridlock: Hello, travelers, let's get to your questions about getting around this region. Metro Web site lies re: Train Times, D.C.: Why doesn't the Metro Web site sync with actual train schedules? I'm often leaving my office at Metro Center late and night, and I hate waiting 15 minutes for a train! So I figured I could look up when the next train was coming and be there to meet it. Except there is no relation to the Metro Web site and actual train schedules! Why??? Dr. Gridlock: I can tell you how it's supposed to work. Here's what Metro says about using its Web site, www.metroopensdoors.com, to get real time information on trains: From the home page, go to the \\"Maps and Stations\\" page and click on \\"Find a Stop/Station.\\" You'll see a list of stations. Click on the on yours. Then click to \\"Next Train Arrival\\" to get the arrival times of the next three trains headed in each direction. What you'll see looks like the electronic display boards on the platforms. The page refreshes every 30 seconds. Arlington, Va.: A big thank you to the Arlington County Police Officer who was pulling over people driving in the breakdown lane on 66-West this morning. This is a chronic problem in the a.m. between Lee Highway and Glebe Road, so it was nice to see someone take some action against it. Dr. Gridlock: It's a frustrating thing to drive I-66, especially at rush periods and especially inside the Beltway, where it's only two lanes. The state is looking at some improvements in the westbound direction that don't involve expanding the right of way. Driving in the breakdown lane is no solution. It's a dangerous thing for those who do it and for other motorists. Fairfax, Va.: This may be more of a Metro question but... Recently the overflow parking lot at the Vienna station closed down. Although Metro offered options of where else to park your car (then take a bus to the station) none are very convenient for me. Several times now I have arrived at the station at around 8, only to find there is no parking (except for all the empty \\"reserved\\" spaces). Metro claims that a new parking deck is being built in 2007, but what do they plan to do about all the new traffic this will cause, and all the back-up this will cause on the trains? Dr. Gridlock: Metro and local governments are planning to add more parking across the region, but construction is not keeping pace with demand. My letter-writers are particularly vexed about the closings of parking areas in some places to make way for construction around Metro stations. Vienna is a case in point. I talked to a group of retired federal workers in the Vienna-Oakton area last week who said they don't even think about taking the train. They like to do their traveling outside of rush hour, and of course, you can't get a parking space at the Vienna Station. Meanwhile, Metro wants to add more reserved parking and overbook it, like airlines overbook seats because they know some people won't show up. I hear from some people frustrated because they've been on the waiting list for reserved parking forever, but I also hear from others who see empty reserved spaces they can't use when everything else is full. Chesapeake Beach, Md.: Why isn't there a bullet train between Baltimore and Washington? Fifteen minutes station to station -- something really revolutionary and modern. Dr. Gridlock: If you go to http://www.bwmaglev.com/, you can read more about the proposal to build a maglev train line between Baltimore and Washington. But the thing is, this would cost about 4 billion to build (and I think the estimate would prove to be low). So what would a one-way ticket cost? Maybe 40? Maybe tourists would use it, or people in a desperate hurry on one particular day. But it's not a solution for commuters. We'd be better off extending Metro's Green Line up that way, building a new light rail line, or enhancing commuter bus service. Can you please let us know the rules regarding bicycles on the escalators when the elevators are down? I am always seeing strollers on the escalators and no one bats an eye... Dr. Gridlock: Here's Metro's rule: \\"Cyclists shall be required to use elevators to access mezzanines and platforms. Escalators and stairs shall not be used except when special requests (for emergency reasons) have been granted by Metro Station Managers, Metro Transit Police, or city/county police or fire officials. Cyclists shall allow other passengers to exit before placing bicycles in or taking bicycles out of the elevators.\\" Metro doesn't want to take a chance on a bike slipping from the riders hands and tumbling down the steps. It's crazy for people to take a chance with a stroller, too. Metro's Web site has a list of stations where the elevators are out of service, so surprises should be rare. Jacksonville, Fla. (but recently D.C.): What do you mean by saying that Porcari \\"knows\\" that Maryland doesn't have enough money to build any new stuff? If they can afford the ICC, why can't they afford other stuff? Dr. Gridlock: What I said on my \\"Get There\\" blog this morning was that incoming Maryland transportation secretary John Porcari Porcari \\"knows that Maryland doesn't have the money or the room to build a lot of big new stuff in the densely populated Washington-Baltimore corridor.\\" I also quoted Porcari saying that his top priority is to make sure that projects under construction or near construction actually get done. That would include the intercounty connector highway, for example. Probably would not include a 4 billion maglev link between Washington and Baltimore. Back on metro after 20 years!: I hope I am not beating a dead horse, but I have noticed some particularly foul odors in Metro stations recently. The odors smell part dead animal, or part burning brakes or some other mechanical piece burning. I notice the smells waiting in stations, but not on trains themselves. Sometimes the smell is enhanced when a train enters the station. Has anyone else noticed or commented on these odors? Dr. Gridlock: If you experienced what a lot of other riders have experienced in the past couple months, Metro says you're smelling the new brake pads. Metro knows the odor is a problem and is working with the manufacturer to fix this. Fairfax, Va.: Can you ask your readers how busy Chain Bridge Road from McLean through Tysons into Vienna is during rush hour? Is it busy throughout the day, or can I get across town better before a certain time in the early morning and early evening? As bad as it may be, is it better than taking the beltway to I66W to get to Vienna instead of Chain Bridge Road? Fairfax, Va.: When the funding finally gets finished for Metro to Tysons/Dulles, do you think we'll finally see movement on rail to Centreville down the median of I-66? Dr. Gridlock: I hope we don't have to wait that long for some way of pushing transit farther out the I-66 corridor. The 4 billion rail to Dulles project won't be finished till 2015, which might be optimistic. Burke, Va.: Why do states constantly think that throwing money at a problem will solve it??? Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work. Until the government figures out a way to create affordable housing near work centers, all of the money in the world is not going to solve the traffic problem! Dr. Gridlock: I agree with what you said. More money is not going to solve the problem. But I do believe that all across this region, we've got to spend a lot more money to help solve it. The problem is so big, it requires a big, complex solution. Make our transportation planning and construction problems more rational, more transparent, more efficient. Coordinate transportation planning and land use planning (like you said, more affordable housing near work centers). But if you just plan better for land use, you haven't solved the problem either. We still have to build roads and transit and sidewalks and bike paths to match up with a smarter design for our communities. Arlington, Va.: Is there any information about how the closing of the Arlington Cemetery station this weekend went? I live in Rosslyn and I do know that the shuttle buses were there, but I decided not to bother to head to Pentagon City because of the business of going in and out of the Pentagon Station both ways, although I suppose riding down to L'Enfant Plaza and switching might have worked. Dr. Gridlock: I haven't heard any complaints -- yet -- about the changes Metrorail imposed this weekend because of the major track work around Arlington Cemetery Station. What say you all? This was a fairly large-scale reorganization. Because of the weekend work, the Yellow Line was extended and the Blue Line was diverted away from the Rosslyn tunnel. Capitol Hill, D.C.: The Montgomery County Planning Board recently approved recommendations to build a bikeway along the entire 18 mile ICC. Right now, the state is only going to build along 7.7 miles (non-contiguous). Did Porcari say anything about the bikeway (since he believes that \\"a proper transportation network offers people choices -- drive, ride transit, bike, walk.\\") Dr. Gridlock: Capitol Hill refers to my interview with incoming MD transportation secretary John Porcari. I didn't ask Porcari specifically about the unfunded portion of the ICC bikeway, but I've got to believe that if he can find a way to extend it along the entire route, he'll do that. During the interview, Porcari frequently mentioned his enthusiasm for the region's bike trails and the need to use every opportunity to expand them. He noted with some pride -- because he was involved in the planning -- that the new Wilson Bridge will be accessible to bikers. Chain Bridge into Vienna: Is a mess. Beltway is by far the better option. Or, take the backroads from McLean to Rt 7 and hop on 66 there. Dr. Gridlock: A response to the traveler's question above. Rockville, Md.: \\"Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work.\\" How much is this versus choose not to live near where they work? I work in downtown D.C. I have some coworkers who live in West Virginia. It's not cost of living (per se). They want to have acres upon acres on which to play on the weekends. They can't buy that here (since it doesn't exist) but they could (if they wanted) buy a nice house with a decent yard close in but, it wouldn't be what they wanted. Dr. Gridlock: That's the problem with Americans. They're never going to do exactly what you tell them. They're going to decide for themselves what's best for them and their families. I do believe in good planning as a partial solution to our transportation problems, but it's unrealistic to think we're going to eliminate the solo driver and get everyone living in areas dense enough to support transit. What is the absolute latest I could leave the D.C. area to get to NYC relatively hassle-free? Is 1:00 pushing it? Dr. Gridlock: Questions about long-distance travel times always vex me, because there's no way to account for what's going to happen to you between here and there. Will the weather change? Will there be a lane-closing accident on I-95 in Delaware? How long will the backup be at Delaware's toll plaza? Also, when you're making a long-distance trip during daylight, you're likely to wander into somebody else's rush period in the congested Northeast corridor. A Delaware highway official pointed out to me that the stretch of I-95 through his state may seem like long-distance pavement to us in Washington, but it's Main Street for New Castle County. (You think I'm obsessing on Delaware?) Washington, D.C.: Re: trains to BWI. Why build a new train? Why extend Metro? There actually is a train that goes there from D.C. and New Carrollton already. The train is called MARC. Granted, the service is awful unless you are going southbound in the a.m. or northbound in the p.m. Oh, and forget about weekends and holidays. But expanding existing service of trains that go from Metro stops to BWI and Baltimore seems to be a lot cheaper than building new tracks or inventing mag-lev trains. The various governments (I'm lumping all transit authorities, state, city, feds together here) should recognize the existing commuter rail networks such as MARC and VRE as reasonable ways to transport large numbers of people around the area, not just a way to get people into D.C. for work. The model should be more along the lines of Long Island RR or NJ Transit, with frequent service even on the weekends, rather than simply 9-5 commuters. Dr. Gridlock: I think improved weekday service on MARC and VRE should be a very high transportation priority. But it's not going to do everything we need -- at least not soon. MARC has to operate on tracks owned by CSX and Amtrak. There are only so many trains that can run on those lines. At a town hall meeting in Montgomery County last week, Porcari was asked if MARC service could run on weekends. Porcari noted that it would require renegotiation of agreements with the rail owners, plus a significant increase in the operating subsidy for MARC. Better equipment and more reliable service would be a good place to start improving MARC. Alexandria, Va.: Is there a resource online that displays what time the Metro stations with parking become full in the morning? Personally, I am interested in the Virginia stations. Thanks! Dr. Gridlock: There's no source I know of. Definitely not anything official from Metro that would help you on a given day. Maybe readers have some suggestions, though? Reston, Va.: Re:Chain Bridge Road From McLean into and through Tyson's it's \\"not that bad\\", assuming that everything is going smoothly. (No accidents, mistimed lights, random cop on the corner, etc.) But 123 into Vienna (after Old Courthouse) is usually a bear, primarily due to volume of both cars and traffic lights. Dr. Gridlock: That's another response to reader question above on best route. Washington, D.C.: Any idea on what the ICC will be signed as when it's complete? Will it be an extension of I-370 or will it have a number at all? Dr. Gridlock: David Buck, spokesman for the Maryland State Highway Administration, tells me that the intercounty connector will be designated as MD 200. Washington, D.C.: I used to work in McLean. I'd suggest that the reader seeking to go to Vienna consider taking the Toll Road west to Spring Hill, go left after the tollbooth, then right on Westpark Drive (the light at the top of the hill after passing the apartments), and follow that until you hit 123 next to the \\"Toilet Bowl Building.\\" Then go right onto 123. This avoids the mall traffic. In my experience 123 was worst during the evening rush hour but was okay during midday, but that was a few years ago. Dr. Gridlock: Another response to the travel question above. (What I've found is that our readers are an army of researchers and they're very willing to help fellow sufferers on the roads and rails. This is a very powerful force.) Arlington, Va.: re: travel between D.C. and NYC -- I've tried, and there is no way to travel during the day and miss rush hour everywhere. If you are actually going to NYC (vs. the suburbs), you stand a chance if you leave D.C. around 9:30 a.m. If you're passing through D.C. to Long Island or Westchester, you'll hit rush hour on the other side of the city. Really your best best is to wait after the p.m. rush ends in D.C., and the later you leave, the better -- you'd be amazed how much traffic is still on the NJ Turnpike at midnight. I usually wait until 9 p.m. before I head out. Dr. Gridlock: Another example of the research army. This was in response to the question about how late you can leave for New York and still avoid a big hassle. By the way, in doing some columns of holiday travel advice, I came to the conclusion that the time you leave outweighs the importance of the route you take in most cases. If you're traveling in the Northeast corridor of during holiday periods, you'll get more benefit from a very early or very late departure than you will from a \\"shortcut.\\" Delaware: I think you are so right to obsess about the backups in Delaware. They really need to stop considering their stretch of I-95 as part of a local Main Street, and start thinking of it as a piece of a vital commercial corridor that connects the entire eastern seaboard. A corridor that is consistently brought to a crashing halt in Delaware. Why don't they have high speed EZ-Pass lanes, similar to the N.J. turnpike, where you can drive through at 55 mph? That facility added to the Delaware Memorial Bridge and to the absurd little toll plaza they use to extort payment from all travelers would help immeasurably. Dr. Gridlock: And I should ask the Del. folks why they can't go for a one-way toll, like so many other turnpike and bridge authorities do. Must be a revenue reason. Probably something about the ease of getting around that toll plaza near the Maryland border. To earlier post (I-66, police officer..) There is a public workshop concerning the westbound I-66. Washington Lee HS, next Tuesday Jan. 23, 7-8:30. Dr. Gridlock: Thanks, Arlington, and I'll mention that in my Road Watch column as well. That meeting is about several ways the state has come up with to ease westbound travel without expanding the right of way on I-66 inside the Beltway. Washington, D.C.: Dr. Gridlock, I'm sure you've heard these comparisons before. I visited NYC a couple of weeks ago and couldn't help but marvel at how much more efficient the subway system is there. My sister was able to go online and figure out the best way for me to get from the city to Queens so that I could be picked up by my in-laws. Not only did it work, but it was a lot quicker than I expected -- on a Saturday! While the trains are not as luxurious as Metro's, they are relatively clean and seemingly run like clockwork and quite frequently -- for a Saturday. I also noticed there is a flat rate and no turnstiles when exiting the station. When will Metro get with the program? Also, do we trade off more luxurious trains and cleaner stations for trains that don't run frequently on weekends, evenings and holidays? Dr. Gridlock: In terms of transit in the U.S., there's New York and then there's everything else. Though it's a century old, the NYC system has lots of natural advantages. The region is so densely populated it can support an enormous transit system. Also, it was built with express tracks, that not only speed travel but also allow the subway managers to work the trains around problems. Still, our Metro system is one of the finest I've seen in my travels. We all want to see it get better, but that shouldn't blind us to this great resource. By the way, the \\"Trip Planner\\" on Metro's Web site is pretty good at helping you get around the region by transit. I use it a lot. Reston, Va.: Anyone want to do an actual headcount of Delaware tags on 95 IN Delaware? I worked there for several years and most folks avoid it like the combination of the plague and Ebola. Dr. Gridlock: Maybe it's like Yogi said: \\"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\\" Around here, we say \\"never again\\" after a bad drive on the Beltway or a crushing experience on the Orange Line. But the next day, we're back in the rut because we haven't found a better way. Tysons Corner, Va.: I have written with this question but have never seen it in your column. I commute to Herndon from Tysons on the Toll Road. Frequently, a Fairfax County bus exits the Dulles Access Road doing 65 or 70, then has to careen over four lanes of traffic in time to get off at its Toll Road exit. I see the same thing the other direction, as buses get onto the Toll Road then swoop to the left to get on the Access Road. This seems like an accident looking for a time to happen. Why are buses allowed to use the Dulles Access Road? And why are they routed so as require such challenging lane changes? Dr. Gridlock: That's not a good maneuver for anybody, let alone a bus. That set up must have been designed for an era with far fewer cars trying to jam through. It is pretty common, though, to give buses access to the fastest possible route. They have access to the carpool lanes, they'll have access to the tolled intercounty connector in Maryland and to the High Occupancy/Toll lanes when they're built from Springfield to American Legion Bridge. Northern Virginia: Dear Dr. Gridlock, Recently I moved to the Ashburn area and commute to Reston. When I travel on Loudoun County Parkway to Waxpool (this is a really big intersection), two things I see every day: 1. People run the red light...not just by a smidgen, but blowing right through it 2. People turning right onto Waxpool from Loudoun County Parkway do so on red from the middle turn lane, even though there is a sign saying \\"No Turn on Red from This Lane\\". But really it's so small that people miss it, or people honk if someone actually stops on red in this lane. Just needed to vent, that is all. Dr. Gridlock: Thought I'd share that vent with the group. \\"Northern Virginia's\\" frustrations are pretty common across the region. Waldorf, Md.: Commuter buses are only as good as the roads they travel. There are plenty of commuter buses coming up to D.C. from Southern Maryland each day, but they sit in the same horrific traffic on 5/301 and into D.C. that I do in my car. I would take the bus if there were dedicated lanes and a consistent schedule. Any talk from Porcari about those types of improvements (or any improvements for that matter) for the fast-growing Southern Maryland region? Dr. Gridlock: First, give the man a chance. He isn't even in Annapolis yet. But I can tell you this: When we were talking about improvements in Maryland's transportation system, Porcari talked specifically about the addition of commuter buses to serve Southern Maryland.

Possible answers: wanted to rob the guests, wanted to ensure the party went smoothly, wanted to steal the coats Answer:","output":"From the given context, it appears that Bailey offered to gather the guests' coats and put them in the coat room primarily to ensure the party went smoothly. However, it is important to consider the various factors at play to better understand Bailey's motives. Firstly, Bailey's actions demonstrate a sense of hospitality and responsibility by taking care of the coats belonging to the party guests. By offering to gather coats, Bailey is making sure that the party attendees can focus their full attention on enjoying themselves without having to worry about the cumbersome task of finding a place to store their outerwear. This act can create a welcoming and friendly atmosphere that contributes to the smooth running of the party. Moreover, Bailey's initiative to keep the coats in the coat room demonstrates organizational skills and an understanding that a clutter-free environment can significantly improve the overall ambiance of the party. By collecting the coats and neatly storing them away in a designated area, Bailey is fostering an environment where guests can easily navigate and feel comfortable in. A well-maintained coat room can also save guests from the headache of searching for their belongings towards the end of the event. Although it is possible that Bailey could have malicious intentions, such as robbing the guests or stealing the coats, these scenarios seem less plausible given the context. It is important to assume the best in people and focus on the potential positive outcomes of their actions. Of course, it would be wise for the party host to keep an eye on the coat room, just as a precautionary measure. In summary, Bailey most likely offered to gather the guests' coats and put them in the coat room to ensure the party went smoothly. This act showcases a desire to create a welcoming and organized environment for the event attendees. While it is possible that Bailey had ulterior motives, it is more appropriate and fair to believe in the goodwill of others until proven otherwise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you say \\"Carpool with six other people or more 0\\" in Spanish?","output":"In Spanish, to say \\"Carpool with six other people or more\\" you would say, \\"Compartir coche con seis personas más o más.\\" Let me break it down for you: 1. \\"Compartir\\" means \\"to share\\" in Spanish and is commonly used when referring to carpooling. This verb can be conjugated depending on the subject, but in this context, we are using the infinitive form, so no conjugation is necessary. 2. \\"Coche\\" is the word for \\"car\\" in Spanish. In some regions, you might also hear it as \\"auto\\" or \\"carro.\\" All these terms are generally understood, but \\"coche\\" is more widely used. 3. \\"Con\\" translates to \\"with\\" in Spanish and is used in the same way as it is in English. It shows that you are doing the action together with one or more other individuals. 4. \\"Seis\\" is the Spanish word for the number \\"six.\\" 5. \\"Personas\\" means \\"people\\" in Spanish, and it's important to match the number with the verb to make it clear how many people are being referred to. In this case, it is plural because there are six other individuals. 6. \\"Más\\" means \\"more\\" in Spanish, and using it twice in this context - \\"más o más\\" - emphasizes that there can be six or even more individuals involved in the carpool. However, the \\"0\\" in the original statement isn't clear in terms of its context or meaning. If you want to imply that there shouldn't be less than six people carpooling, you could say, \\"Compartir coche con seis personas más o más, pero nunca menos de seis,\\" which translates to, \\"Carpool with six other people or more, but never less than six.\\" In summary, the phrase \\"Compartir coche con seis personas más o más\\" or \\"Compartir coche con seis personas más o más, pero nunca menos de seis\\" can be used to convey \\"Carpool with six other people or more\\" in Spanish, depending on the specific context."},{"instruction":"Cameron won the award for directing the student film last year.

Here is a goal: To increase the gas mileage of your vehicle, Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To increase the gas mileage of your vehicle, you can consider several ways. I will list a few and then determine which one makes the most sense. 1. Maintain proper tire pressure: Ensuring that your tires are inflated to the recommended pressure can improve gas mileage by reducing friction between tires and road. 2. Get regular engine tune-ups: Regular maintenance of your vehicle's engine and systems like oil change and filter replacements will keep it running efficiently and improve gas mileage. 3. Drive at a moderate speed: Faster speeds require more fuel to maintain, so driving at a moderate speed will help save gas. 4. Use air conditioning wisely: Air conditioning consumes more fuel, so using it judiciously or rolling down the windows when possible can help save gas. 5. Reduce excess weight: Unnecessary weight in your vehicle can decrease fuel efficiency, so removing excess items can improve gas mileage. 6. Plan trips efficiently: Combining errands into a single trip and navigating the shortest routes can help reduce the amount of fuel consumed. Considering these options, the most sensible way to improve gas mileage would be a combination of steps, with the focus on regular maintenance (engine tune-ups, oil changes, and filter replacements), maintaining proper tire pressure, driving at moderate speeds, and reducing excess weight in the vehicle. While the other steps can also contribute to fuel efficiency, these stand out as the most impactful in general."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Aaron had more friends than Christopher had because","output":"Aaron had an innate ability to connect with people that Christopher lacked. This made it easier for Aaron to cultivate and maintain friendships. Over the years, Aaron developed a large friend circle, while Christopher had comparatively fewer friends. One of the primary reasons for this disparity was that Aaron was great at empathetic listening. Whenever someone expressed their thoughts and feelings to him, he genuinely listened and understood their perspective. This warm, empathetic demeanor drew people to Aaron and helped solidify strong bonds of friendship. Aaron also had an infectious sense of humor that never failed to brighten up any room he entered. People gravitated towards his exuberance and enjoyed being around him. Christopher, on the other hand, was a bit more reserved in nature. While he had a pleasant demeanor, it was harder for him to initiate conversations and playfully engage with others. This made it challenging for Christopher to connect with new people, as they may have perceived him as somewhat serious and difficult to approach. Another factor that contributed to the difference in the number of friends Aaron and Christopher had was their interests and hobbies. Aaron was passionate about a wide range of activities, from sports to the arts. This allowed him to bond with people from various walks of life and create a diverse friend group. Christopher, on the other hand, had a narrower range of interests, which limited the number of people he could naturally connect with and form friendships. Additionally, Aaron had a strong belief in the value of networking and staying in touch with friends and acquaintances. He made it a point to reach out to people frequently and maintain connections, even if only through casual messaging or occasional meet-ups. This helped ensure that he was constantly nurturing his relationships, allowing them to grow and flourish. Christopher, on the other hand, wasn't as focused on maintaining contact, which sometimes led to friendships fizzling out or dwindling over time. Moreover, Aaron often hosted social events and gatherings, inviting friends and their acquaintances to his home. These events allowed Aaron to meet many new people, providing ample opportunities for forming new friendships. Unlike Aaron, Christopher preferred smaller, more intimate gatherings, which ultimately limited his exposure to new social circles. Lastly, Aaron's openness and willingness to help others endeared him to many people. He was the kind of person who would go out of his way to offer assistance, even if it was for someone he didn't know very well. This trait made others feel comfortable around Aaron and encouraged them to consider him a close friend. Christopher, while caring and kind, was often preoccupied with his own worries, making it more difficult for him to extend himself to others in a similar fashion. In summary, Aaron had more friends than Christopher because of his genuine empathy and ability to connect with others, his engaging personality and sense of humor, diverse interests, dedication to maintaining relationships, proactive approach to socializing, and his thoughtfulness towards others. Christopher's somewhat reserved nature, narrower range of interests, and focus on his own concerns made it more challenging for him to develop and maintain the same number of friendships as Aaron."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This period is generally taken to coincide with a major shift in population from southern Mesopotamia toward the north. Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. Soil salinity in this region had been long recognized as a major problem. Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely. During the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths. This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language. Henceforth Sumerian would remain only a literary and liturgical language, similar to the position occupied by Latin in medieval Europe.

Answer based on context: The Broncos played the Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, in a rematch of the 2005 AFC Championship Game.  The Broncos got on the scoreboard quick with Jake Plummer throwing a 16-yard touchdown strike to WR Rod Smith on their first drive of the game.  On the ensuing kickoff, the Steelers fumbled the ball, with the Broncos recovering deep into Steelers' territory.  Plummer then threw a 10-yard pass to WR Javon Walker to make the score 14-0. On the next drive, the Steelers got to the Denver 41-yard line when QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 35-yard pass to WR Cedrick Wilson, who then fumbled the ball and the Broncos recovered. In the second quarter, the Steelers dominated play outscoring the Broncos 10-0 on the quarter.  Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker for his first touchdown pass of the game.  The Steelers were about to score on their next possession when Roethlisberger threw an interception near the end zone to CB Champ Bailey.  After the Broncos showed no offense in the quarter, and the Steelers missed a 40-yard field goal, the quarter ended with the Steelers' Jeff Reed kicking a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver quickly scored with a 72-yard end around run by Javon Walker.  On their next drive, the Steelers were driving down the field, when Roethlisberger threw another interception to Champ Bailey near the end zone. Denver was unable to get out of their own end zone after that and punted to the Steelers, who scored on the next drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Willie Parker. Denver put the game to an end in the fourth quarter with another 10-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Walker.  This came after the Steelers punted from their own 1-yard line and the Broncos began the series on the Steelers' 17-yard line.  Both the Steelers and the Broncos scored field goals on their next possessions, the Steelers with a 29-yard field goal and Denver with a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh again, down by 11, nearly made it a 4-point game when WR Hines Ward leaped into the end zone, but fumbled from a John Lynch (American football) tackle, whereby the Broncos safety Curome Cox recovered the fumble.  On the Steelers next possession, Roethlisberger again threw an interception, this time to Curome Cox, ending the game.

The Latin 'Tabula Rasa' (a term covering various philosophical concepts, e.g., humans minds are 'empty' at birth) translates literally to mean what? What is the answer?","output":"The Latin term \\"Tabula Rasa\\" translates literally to \\"blank slate\\" or \\"erased tablet\\" in English. This term, which has been adopted by various philosophical concepts and theories, refers to the idea that human beings are born with minds that are essentially \\"empty\\" or devoid of any innate ideas or knowledge. Instead, proponents of this notion argue that all knowledge, beliefs, values, and personality traits are acquired and developed through individual experiences, societal conditioning, and sensory inputs as people grow and interact with their environment. The concept of \\"tabula rasa\\" can be traced back to the work of ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who believed that the mind began as a blank sheet that would then be filled with knowledge as a person acquired experiences. Despite its ancient origins, the concept has persisted through the centuries and has been adopted, adapted, and debated by various philosophers and thinkers. John Locke, a 17th-century English philosopher, expanded on the concept of \\"tabula rasa\\" in his influential work \\"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.\\" According to Locke, human beings are born without any innate ideas or knowledge, and all of our mental content comes from two primary sources: sensation, through which we acquire information about our external environment, and reflection, which involves the processing and interpretation of the information obtained through sensation. The \\"tabula rasa\\" concept has been utilized and challenged by various schools of thought over time. For instance, proponents of empiricism, which emphasizes the role of experience in shaping knowledge, tend to support the idea of the mind as a \\"blank slate.\\" In contrast, those who advocate for the existence of innate ideas, such as the rationalists, argue against \\"tabula rasa\\" and maintain that certain ideas or knowledge are inherent to human beings. In the field of psychology, the \\"tabula rasa\\" notion has influenced the development of behaviorism, which highlights the importance of learning, conditioning, and environmental factors in shaping human behavior. However, advancements in cognitive and neuroscience research have shed light on the complex interplay between genetic predispositions, brain structure, and environmental influences in the development of human cognition and behavior, suggesting the need for a more nuanced perspective that goes beyond the \\"blank slate\\" metaphor. In summary, the Latin term \\"tabula rasa\\" translates literally to \\"blank slate\\" or \\"erased tablet,\\" and it refers to the philosophical concept that humans are born with empty minds that acquire knowledge, beliefs, and traits through experiences and interactions with their environment.

This is to be healthier and to be more environmentally friendly. They don't give up meat completely, but eat good quality meat less often. Founder Brian Kateman believes people will follow diet as it's not radical. 'Eating less meat is easy, healthy and good for the environment', he says. Article:","output":"Title: Embracing Reducetarianism: A Trail towards Health and Environmental Sustainability The burgeoning Reducetarian Movement is drawing vast attention offering a realistic approach towards a healthier lifestyle and a more sustainable Earth. Reducetarians commit to consciously reduce their consumption of meat, seafood, and dairy products without eliminating these food items entirely. Their mission is anchored in two primary objectives, enhancing individual health and promoting environmental sustainability. Unlike the stringent plant-based diet alternatives, the reducetarian approach allows for a more accessible and feasible transition, which according to its founder Brian Kateman, will attract a larger demographic of followers.  Reduce to Enhance: The Health Perspective A well-implemented reducetarian diet can have profound health benefits. By limiting the intake of meat, seafood, and dairy, it helps reduce the exposure to harmful saturated fats and cholesterol found in animal products, which are associated with diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and certain forms of cancer. Additionally, a diet that is high in plant-based foods - such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and seeds - promotes a healthier cardiovascular system and supports weight management, reducing risks associated with obesity and diabetes. However, it is crucial to note that reducetarians do not completely exclude meat from their diets. The philosophy is to minimize, not eliminate, underpinning the importance of balance. High-quality meat is still on the menu, but the emphasis is on consuming it less frequently. With this approach, one can still enjoy the benefits of proteins, vitamins, and other essential nutrients found in meat, but with a reduced risk of health complications.  Minimize to Sustain: The Environmental Angle Beyond the health implications, the reducetarian movement presents a strong case on the environmental front. The production of animal-based food items—particularly beef, seafood, and dairy—is taxing to the environment, demanding exorbitant amounts of water, land, and energy. It also significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, a leading factor in climate change. By choosing to be a reducetarian, one commits to relieving some of this planetary burden, transitioning toward a more sustainable diet and lifestyle.  While going vegan or vegetarian can indeed have a more significant environmental impact, not everyone is ready or willing to make such an extreme dietary commitment. This is where the reducetarian approach comes into play—it's about progress, not perfection. Reducing meat, seafood, and dairy consumption should not be seen as an absolute, but as an accessible goal that anyone can work towards, bringing collective benefits to the planet. As Brian Kateman, the cofounder of the Reducetarian Foundation, aptly puts it, \\"Eating less meat is easy, healthy, and good for the environment.\\" This statement underscores the reducetarian belief that responsible consumption doesn't need to be a radical, inaccessible lifestyle change. It can be as simple as eating less meat and more plant-based foods—a subtle shift with monumental benefits to both personal health and environmental sustainability.  In conclusion, the reducetarian movement signifies an important shift in how we conceptualize diet and its broader impacts. It encourages individuals to take manageable steps toward better health and a more sustainable world, making it a viable alternative for those reluctant to completely eliminate animal products from their diets. Reducing rather than eliminating allows the everyday citizen to make a significant difference in their lives and indeed, in the world. As more people become conscious of their dietary choices, reducetarianism might just be the bridge we need towards a more inclusive and sustainable approach to eating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the food was plentiful happens, how will it affect LESS mold forming on bread.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"A: If food was plentiful, it could potentially have an indirect effect on the amount of mold forming on bread. When there is an abundance of food, people may consume food more quickly, leaving less opportunity for mold to develop on the bread. The rate at which the bread is consumed could outpace the growth of mold, thus leading to less mold formation overall. Additionally, if food is plentiful, proper storage and management practices may be implemented, such as using airtight containers or refrigeration, which can slow or inhibit mold growth. This further reduces the chances for mold to form on the bread. However, the process of mold growth itself will likely not be directly affected by the presence of plentiful food. If the mold spore lands on the bread, it will still grow hyphae into the bread and follow the mold growth process outlined in the initial question.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You can create an alternative outdoor litter box for cats by using a new or old sandbox that is at least as big as a large litter box. Fill it with soft, fine-grained sand (this can be bought by the bag at hardware and home supply stores), which cats find especially attractive. With luck, cats will be drawn to the sandbox instead of your garden and use it much as they would a litterbox.  Make sure to scoop the sandbox regularly; if it gets too full, cats may return to using your yard. Keep children away from the cat sandbox, and make sure they understand not to play in it. If you want to keep cats out of your garden, but don’t mind them being in other areas of your yard, then try making a cat-friendly area. Cats will be attracted to areas covered by certain plants, and hopefully leave the rest of your yard alone. Create a small plot and grow one or more of the following non-toxic plants in it:  Catnip (Nepeta cataria) Catmint (Nepeta mussinii) Cat thyme (Teucrium marum) Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) Spider-plant (Chlorophytum comosum) If you have a bird feeder near your garden, move it to another area of your yard that is further away. Ideally, you should hang the bird feeder in an area that is too high for a cat to jump to. Otherwise, a bird that visits for a meal might be in more danger than your garden ever was. Summary:","output":"To create an alternative outdoor litter box for cats, follow these steps: 1. Choose a suitable location in your yard, away from your garden and children's play areas. 2. Use a new or old sandbox that is at least as large as a standard litter box. 3. Fill the sandbox with soft, fine-grained sand, which can be purchased from hardware and home supply stores. 4. Monitor the sandbox to ensure cats are using it, and keep it clean by regularly scooping out waste. 5. Educate children not to play in the cat sandbox. 6. To further deter cats from your garden, create a cat-friendly area in your yard by planting cat-attracting non-toxic plants such as catnip, catmint, cat thyme, valerian, and spider-plant. 7. Move any bird feeders to a location far from the garden, and make sure they are placed high enough to prevent cats from jumping to them. By providing an appealing alternative for cats, you can effectively keep them away from your garden while maintaining a comfortable space for them to roam and play in the rest of your yard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Soviet nukes falling into the hands of rogue states or terrorists has, as far as is known, remained fiction, despite occasional doubts about whether the system was airtight. The vast nuclear arsenal, scattered among several newly independent nations, was secured because Russian military officers acted with professionalism and honesty, Moscow and Washington shared clear priorities, and the U.S. taxpayer coughed up billions of dollars, former top officials who dealt with the Soviet nuclear legacy say. ‘Thousands of scientists participated in this project in OPTIONS: - American and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Associated Press and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Belarus and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Kazakhstan and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Moscow and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Russia and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Russian and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Soviet and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Soviet Union and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - U.S. and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Ukraine and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Washington and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - former Soviet Union and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said.","output":"- Kazakhstan and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"A: The concept of someone or something laughing on the dark side of the moon captures the imagination and sparks curiosity. The dark side of the moon, also referred to as the far side of the moon, is the hemisphere that always faces away from Earth due to the moon's synchronous rotation. This mysterious and less explored part of the moon has been featured in various forms of literature, art, and music, often as a symbol of the unknown and the uncharted. When it comes to the question of who laughs on the dark side of the moon, there is no definitive answer, as it is open to interpretation and imagination. However, we can explore various possibilities, ranging from mythology and folklore to popular culture and science fiction. 1. Mythology and Folklore: In many ancient cultures, the moon has been associated with various deities, each possessing their distinct attributes and stories. Lunar deities like the Greek goddess Artemis, the Roman goddess Diana, and the Chinese goddess Chang'e are often linked with the moon's mysterious qualities, possibly enjoying a moment of laughter on its dark side. 2. Popular Culture: Pink Floyd's iconic album \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" may come to mind when discussing laughter on the dark side of the moon. This classic record, known for its introspective themes and atmospheric sound, could suggest that creative artists or characters from their songs might find solace in the moon's hidden depths, sharing moments of laughter and introspection. 3. Science Fiction: In the realm of science fiction, various extraterrestrial beings or advanced human civilizations might be imagined to inhabit the dark side of the moon. These beings, concealed from our view, may indulge in moments of joy, happiness, and laughter, adding a layer of intrigue and wonder to the stories that portray them. 4. Robots and AI: As modern space exploration advances, robots and AI, like lunar rovers or future moon bases, could find their way to the dark side of the moon. While these machines may not physically \\"laugh,\\" they could metaphorically represent human ingenuity and exploration, giving us a reason to rejoice in our achievements and advancements despite the vast and unknown territories of the far side of the moon. In summary, the notion of who laughs on the dark side of the moon can be interpreted and contextualized in various ways. It invokes a sense of wonder, prompting us to consider the mysterious, unknown, and unexplored aspects of our universe. The laughter might symbolize the joy of discovery, the feeling of unity in shared experiences, or even the playfulness of our imagination as we venture into the cosmos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

The information given indicates that he is a well-known film director and producer who has been involved with several high-profile films, but it does not provide specific details about his viewing habits or the processes he follows during editing and post-production. In fact, the role of a director and producer often requires viewing the movie multiple times during the creation and editing process. During pre-production and production, the director is on set, observing each scene as it's filmed. They work closely with the cast and crew to achieve their desired vision for each scene.  Then, during post-production, the director collaboratively works with the editor, checking assembled footage, making decisions about the inclusion and arrangement of scenes, sound effects, music integration, and visual effects selection among others. This is an intensive and iterative process, often requiring the director to watch the film, or portions of it, repeatedly to ensure all elements are pieced together in a way that delivers the film as envisaged. Additionally, it is common for directors to watch their final product in full after completion, either privately or at a premiere screening. Thus, it's highly likely that Doug Liman, as a seasoned director and producer, has watched his movies all the way through, though the provided text does not explicitly confirm this. Again, conclusions about someone's actions or habits should only be drawn from concrete information, and in this case, no such detail is provided regarding Liman's viewing habits."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Eurythmics were a British music duo consisting of members Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart. Stewart and Lennox were both previously in the band The Tourists (originally known as The Catch), who split up in 1980; Eurythmics were formed that year in Wagga Wagga. The duo released their first album, In the Garden, in 1981 to little fanfare, but went on to achieve global success with their second album Sweet Dreams Eurythmics released their next album, Revenge, in 1986. The album continued their move towards a band sound, verging on an AOR-pop/rock sound. Sales continued to be strong in the UK and internationally, but were somewhat slower in the U.S., though \\"Missionary Man\\" reached number 14 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart and went all the way to No. 1 on the US Album Oriented Rock chart (AOR). Revenge would eventually certify double Platinum in the UK and Gold in the U.S. The band went on a massive worldwide tour in support of the album, and a live concert video from the Australian leg of the tour was released.  In 1987, Lennox and Stewart released the album Savage. This saw a fairly radical change within the group's sound, being based mainly around programmed samples and drum loops (Lennox would later say that where Revenge was more of a Stewart album in sound, Savage was more of a Lennox one). Lyrically the songs showed an even darker, more obsessive side to Lennox's writing. A video album was also made, directed by Sophie Muller, with a video for each song. This was largely a concept piece, following characters portrayed by Lennox, specifically one of a frustrated housewife-turned-vamp (as exemplified in \\"Beethoven (I Love to Listen To)\\", a UK top 30 hit). The brazen, sexually charged rocker \\"I Need a Man\\" remains a Eurythmics staple, as does \\"You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart\\". Much less commercial than the two previous albums, Savage was mostly ignored in the U.S., although rock radio in more progressive markets supported \\"I Need a Man\\". In the duo's native UK however, the album was a top 10 success and was certified Platinum.  In 1989, Eurythmics released the album We Too Are One, which entered the UK album chart at no.1 (their second no.1 album after Touch) and gave the duo four UK Top 30 hit singles. The album was a return to the rock/pop sound of their mid-80s albums and was certified Double Platinum in the UK, but was less successful in the U.S. (although the single \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\" grazed the Billboard Top 40). Other singles from the album included \\"Revival\\", \\"The King and Queen of America\\" and \\"Angel\\". The duo also conducted a world tour for the album in late 1989. Did they have any singles?","output":"Yes, Eurythmics had several singles.

Here are some concepts: alcohol, effect, sleep What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"Alcohol consumption can significantly affect the quality and duration of sleep by altering the normal sleep pattern and causing sleep disruptions. To provide a more detailed answer, it's important to understand the separate concepts first and then explore how they correlate. Alcohol: Alcohol is a psychoactive substance with a depressant effect, produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts. It is one of the most widely used recreational substances worldwide and is consumed in various forms, such as beer, wine, and spirits. Moderate to heavy consumption can lead to physical dependence and addiction. Effect: In this context, the effect refers to the impact or alterations caused in the body's processes or functions due to the intake of a substance, in this case, alcohol. Sleep: Sleep is a vital process that allows the body and brain to rest and recover. It's divided into various stages, including REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and non-REM sleep, each of which carries out crucial physiological and psychological functions. Quality and adequate duration of sleep are crucial for overall health and wellbeing. Now, bringing these concepts together, we find that alcohol can significantly affect sleep. Despite its initial sedative effect, alcohol can disrupt the sleep cycle. While it might help you fall asleep faster, it hampers the quality of your sleep. One reason is that alcohol can suppress REM sleep early on in the night, which is when most dreaming occurs and when memories may be consolidated. As the alcohol begins to wear off, often in the second half of the night, there is often a 'rebound' effect where the REM sleep returns but is more intense. This can lead to more vivid and sometimes disturbing dreams.  Alcohol also relaxes the muscles in the body, including those in the throat, making you more prone to snoring and sleep apnea. Moreover, it acts as a diuretic, increasing the need to urinate during the night and thereby causing disruptions in sleep. Heavy or chronic use of alcohol can lead to prolonged sleep disruptions and is associated with insomnia. Hence, while many people might resort to alcohol as a sleep aid, it's important to understand that it could compromise the quality and restfulness of sleep in the long run. Instead, maintaining good sleep hygiene, including regular sleep schedules and a conducive sleep environment, can prove more beneficial for sleep health. Additionally, seeking professional help is recommended for those struggling with sleep disorders or alcohol dependency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The process you outlined involves oil being used as a heating source for homes, and you propose a perturbation hypothesis related to an increase in coal miners. Let's analyze the direct and indirect effects this perturbation might have on the heating process for a house that uses oil as the main heat source. 1. Direct effects:  The immediate effect of having more coal miners relates to the coal industry rather than the oil industry. The direct influence on the oil-based heating process for a house is insignificant, as the extraction and transport of oil are not dependent on coal mining. 2. Indirect effects: However, various indirect effects can be identified, some of which may have an impact on the overall heating process of a house using oil: a. Increased coal production: With more coal miners, there might be an increase in coal production, which may lead to a more abundant supply of coal. Since coal is also used as a heating source for homes, an abundant supply of coal could result in lower coal prices. b. Market competition: If coal prices decrease as a result of the more abundant supply, this could create increased market competition between coal and other heating sources, including oil. Homeowners might be more inclined to switch to coal-based heating systems if they are cheaper. This shift in demand could potentially affect the oil industry, leading to a decrease in demand for oil. c. Environmental implications: Increased coal mining and utilization have environmental implications, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and health concerns for people living near coal mines. If this becomes a widespread concern, there might be a push toward more sustainable and cleaner energy solutions for heating homes, such as solar or geothermal systems. In this case, the use of oil as a heating source may decrease, resulting in less heat for houses still using oil. d. Economic impact: The increase in coal mining jobs and potential economic growth associated with a more robust coal industry might lead to changes in the economy. This could affect the cost of oil and other heating options, impacting homeowners' decisions on which heating source to use. In conclusion, while the direct effect of having more coal miners on the oil-based heating process in a house is negligible, there may be several indirect effects which could impact the overall house-heating process using oil. These indirect effects are primarily related to market competition between heating sources, environmental implications, and economic factors. However, the extent to which these indirect effects would result in less heat for a house using oil would depend on a range of factors, including regional availability of coal, pricing, regional and global policies, technological advances, and individual homeowners' preferences. Without more specific information, it is difficult to predict how the proposed perturbation would quantitatively affect the heating process for houses using oil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \\"This award came as a real surprise to me.

Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since:  John was studying the history of dinosaurs. He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history.  Which era would more likely be shorter, era A or era B?","output":"To determine which era is more likely to be shorter, we need to look at the characteristics of both eras. Era A: The time when dinosaurs were flourishing before the mass extinction event 66 million years ago. This era represents a span of time when dinosaurs were evolving and thriving in their respective environments. As a whole, the Mesozoic Era, which includes the time when dinosaurs flourished, lasted approximately 180 million years. Era B: The mass extinction event that occurred around 66 million years ago, also known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. This event led to a significant loss of species on Earth, including the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. The event itself was caused by multiple factors, such as volcanic activity and the impact of a large asteroid. Extinction events, even mass extinctions, occur relatively quickly compared to the vast time scales of pre-extinction and post-extinction eras. Given the nature of extinction events and the time it takes for species to evolve and flourish, Era B (the mass extinction event) is more likely to be shorter than Era A (the time when dinosaurs were flourishing). This is because extinction events typically represent a brief period of time when compared to the longer timescales of species evolution and adaptation in different eras throughout Earth's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, this does not answer the original question about the fields of science in which the genome is studied. Here is a more detailed and long answer addressing the question: A genome is the complete set of genetic information encoded in an organism's DNA or RNA. The study of genomes is essential for understanding various biological processes and functions, and numerous scientific fields contribute to research in genomics. Some of these fields include: 1. Genetics: This is the fundamental field that studies genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms. The study of genomes within genetics delves into understanding inheritance patterns, identifying gene functions, and discovering how mutations can lead to genetic diseases. 2. Molecular Biology: This field investigates the molecular interactions and processes within a cell, focusing on the roles of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Studying genomes in molecular biology helps unravel the mechanisms of gene expression and regulation, as well as understanding how different molecules interact with genetic material. 3. Biochemistry: The study of biochemical processes within living organisms is crucial in understanding gene function. Researchers investigate how genes code for the synthesis and degradation of biomolecules, their interactions, and how these influence cellular processes and pathways. 4. Bioinformatics: This interdisciplinary field combines computer science, biology, and mathematics to analyze and interpret large-scale biological data sets, such as genome sequences. Bioinformaticians develop algorithms and software tools to study relationships between genes, proteins, and regulatory elements, facilitating the understanding of gene function, evolution, and disease mechanisms. 5. Evolutionary Biology: The study of genomes in this context allows scientists to examine the genetic differences among species throughout evolution. Comparing genomes can reveal evolutionary relationships between organisms, the conservation of essential genes, and the emergence of new genes that may contribute to the unique characteristics of a species. 6. Genomic Medicine: In this field, researchers investigate the genetic basis of diseases and develop therapeutic strategies targeting specific genetic components. Whole-genome sequencing and functional genomics studies have identified genes and genomic elements associated with various disorders, leading to personalized medicine and gene therapy approaches in the clinic. 7. Environmental Genomics: This branch of genomics explores how organisms interact with their environments on a genetic level. Environmental genomics examines gene-environment interactions, identifies genes responsible for adaptation to specific habitats, and studies the role of genomes in shaping ecological processes. These fields, along with many others, contribute to the comprehensive understanding of genomes, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying various biological processes and advancing the knowledge and applications in medicine, agriculture, and environmental science."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Photo: Sonoma County Sheriff's Office Photo: Sonoma County Sheriff's Office Image 1 of / 15 Caption Close Sonoma County survivalist charged with mysterious killings on Jenner beach 1 / 15 Back to Gallery      A Sonoma County survivalist who has long been known for strange and violent behavior, and who already stands accused of gunning down his brother, has been charged with murdering a young engaged couple in August 2004 as they lay in sleeping bags on a beach in Jenner.      Shaun Michael Gallon, the lead suspect in the Jenner case for the past year, faces two counts of murder in the gunshot killings of Lindsay Cutshall, 22, of Fresno, Ohio, and her 26-year-old fiance, Jason Allen of Zeeland, Mich.      Gallon, 39, is eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted, but Sonoma County prosecutors have not said whether they will seek execution. Prosecutors also charged Gallon with attempted murder in a separate package bomb case in Monte Rio in 2004.      Sonoma County Chief Deputy District Attorney Spencer Brady said Gallon was never ruled out as a suspect in the cold-case murders.      “After he was in custody for the death of his brother, the Sheriff’s Department developed new evidence that linked him to the 2004 murders of Jason and Lindsay,” Brady said. He added that prosecutors wouldn’t elaborate on the new evidence entailed until Gallon’s preliminary hearing.      Now Playing:      The Sonoma County public defender’s office, which is representing Gallon, could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.      The charges, filed last week, are a major step in a long-running cold case. Sonoma County sheriff’s investigators spent more than a dozen years pursuing the beach gunman, searching for suspects across the country while looking at gun records and eyeing serial killers.      Gallon was long considered a “person of interest” in the slayings, but the break in the case did not come until March 24, 2017, when Gallon allegedly killed his younger brother in Forestville, shooting him several times.      Investigators said Gallon, after being arrested, told police enough to tie him to the killings of Cutshall and Allen. But prosecutors held off on filing charges as detectives continued to dig into the case.      The allegations say Gallon, who was 25 at the time, shot the pair with a .45-caliber Marlin rifle at close range as they slept on secluded Fish Head Beach near the mouth of the Russian River.      The couple had been working that summer at a Christian youth camp along the American River in El Dorado County and had gone on a three-day sightseeing trip up the coast that would have taken them through Forestville.      Investigators said Cutshall and Allen didn’t know Gallon, though it’s unclear whether they might have had an interaction with him before their deaths.

On that day, the mother of the two men called for help, saying 36-year-old Shamus Gallon had been shot with a rifle at the home where the family lived on the 9800 block of River Road. The family had moved to the home from Guerneville after the brothers’ father killed himself in 2013.      The mother reported that Shaun Gallon had left the house with the rifle and driven away in his minivan, officials said. He was swiftly apprehended and charged with murder.      It wasn’t Gallon’s first brush with the law. He was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for shooting an arrow at a man in Guerneville, just west of Forestville, on Jan. 27, 2009.      Gallon, described by investigators in that case as a survivalist, served a three-year sentence — spending some of his time at San Quentin State Prison — after wounding James McNeil of Monte Rio, who was sitting in a parked convertible on Mill Street when an arrow came through the soft top of the car and grazed his head.      Gallon had convictions in his 20s for resisting arrest, weapons possession, theft, drunken driving and hunting abalone without proper paperwork, records show.      The new attempted-murder charges stem from a package bomb that exploded on June 10, 2004, when 27-year-old Parvoneh Leval picked up a box left on her boyfriend John Robles’ car. Leval was treated for severe cuts and bruises on her hand and arm.      Cutshall and Allen were killed sometime after nightfall on Aug. 14, 2004, and before sunrise Aug. 16, officials said. Their bodies were found in their sleeping bags Aug. 18. Both were shot in the head. Cutshall and Allen were killed just weeks before they were to return to the Midwest to get married.      Detectives on the case pursued a number of possible motives in the killings — from sexual assault to murder-suicide, all of which were ruled out.

Gallon, 39, has been held in Sonoma County Jail since he was arrested in March 2017 in the slaying of his younger brother in their family home. His detention led to jailhouse interviews with investigators in the Jenner case, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, and just weeks later, in May 2017, then-Sheriff Steve Frietas identified Gallon as the gunman who killed Lindsay Cutshall, 22, and her fiance, Jason Allen, 26, as they lay in sleeping bags at secluded Fish Head Beach.      Gallon, who was known in the Russian River area where he grew up for strange behavior and run-ins with law enforcement, was interviewed by sheriff’s officials at the time but never detained in connection with the case.      Sheriff Rob Giordano said the Jenner killings were “horrific” for the Cutshall and Allen families and for Sonoma County — a cold case that defined careers for many of the hundreds of Sheriff’s Office personnel involved in the search for the gunman.      “Unfortunately, there are evil people in our community, not many, but he is one of those people,” Giordano said. “I’m just really glad he’s off the street now.”      On Friday, prosecutors filed documents in Sonoma County Superior Court charging Gallon with killing Cutshall and Allen. He was arraigned on those charges Monday morning in a brief court hearing. Prosecutors also charged him with one count of attempted murder in a separate case dating to 2004, when he is alleged to have left on top of a car a package bomb that exploded, injuring a Monte Rio woman. He did not enter a plea.      Sonoma County Chief Deputy District Attorney Brian Staebell said prosecutors received an essential set of reports from the Sheriff’s Office on May 1, including documents from 13 years of investigative work, and after reviewing the files they were able to charge Gallon with the killings.      “It was a very thorough investigation,” Staebell said.      Prosecutors, led by Chief Deputy District Attorney Spencer Brady, are still reviewing whether to seek the death penalty in connection with the double murder.      Details in a spate of criminal cases against Gallon dating to 2004 cast him as a darkly troubled man, a self-taught survivalist and weapons fanatic who in 2009 shot a man with a hand-fashioned bow and arrow. In addition to the bombing, Gallon now stands accused of shooting to death three people, including his brother, Shamus Gallon, in their family home in Forestville last year, and Cutshall and Allen on the Jenner beach 14 years ago.      His suspected motives remain unknown.      “There is no question that he suffers from mental illness,” Sonoma County Public Defender Kathleen Pozzi said.      Pozzi said she’s still not convinced Gallon was involved in the Jenner killings, and she may file a motion requesting the two murder cases and attempted homicide case be handled separately because they are unrelated. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Shaun Michael Gallon, a 38-year-old survivalist from Sonoma County, has been charged with the 2004 double murder of a young engaged couple, Lindsay Cutshall and Jason Allen, who were found dead in their sleeping bags on a beach in Jenner, California.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., issued an ominous warning to consumers who use the exchanges to keep a record of every error they encounter on HealthCare.gov \\"in order to protect themselves from potential fraud, double billing, and penalties once the mandate is enforced.\\" \\"Make no mistake: The IRS will go after anyone who fails to meet the Obamcare requirements, so it's important that consumers document the online problems,\\" Rubio said. In fact, the Affordable Care Act limitsthe IRS' ability to collect the mandated fine if a taxpayer chooses not to purchase insurance. \\"In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty imposed by [the mandate], such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure,\\" the law says. That includes curtailing the IRS' power to seize property. Republicans have launched several lines of investigation into the law. At least three House committees are expected to launch inquiries into the law's weaknesses, including a House Energy and Commerce Committee scheduled for Thursday entitled, \\"Implementation Failures: Didn't Know or Didn't Disclose?\\" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, sent a letter earlier this month to Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius last month asking about the alleged architectural problems with HealthCare.gov. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, echoed Republican demands that Sebelius testify before Congress as early as this week. \\"Americans didn't get any answers from the president today, but the House's oversight of this failure is just beginning,\\" Boehner said. \\"With more than one trillion taxpayer dollars being spent on a completely defective program, Congress is going to get to the bottom of this debacle.\\" HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters told CBS News that Sebelius and other HHS officials could testify before Congress as early as next week, though nothing is confirmed at this time -- and it won't be in time for the Thursday hearing. \\"We are in close communication with the committee and have expressed our desire to be responsive to their request,\\" Peters said. \\"We have always indicated to the committee that she intended to testify but that she had a scheduling conflict. We continue to work with them to find a mutually agreeable date in the near future.\\" Yet there still seems to be little unity among the GOP on what to do about the law going forward: Call for a full repeal, which is unrealistic given the Democratic majority in the Senate? Push for a delay of the heart of the law, the individual mandate that Americans purchase health insurance or pay a fine? Or simply wait for the law's problems to spur a wave of negative press and public opinion? Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who helped spark the strategy to shut down the government over the law's funding, is still calling for the law to be defunded and repealed. On ABC's \\"This Week\\" Sunday, he would not rule out the possibility of another government shutdown, saying he will \\"do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare.\\" Others have said the persistent and narrow focus on the Affordable Care Act takes too much oxygen away from other Republican priorities, like cutting spending and the size of government. \\"I think focusing on Obamacare takes you away from the larger picture,\\" said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., on NBC's Meet the Press. \\"We have 128 trillion worth of unfunded liabilities and the total net worth of our country is 94 trillion and we have another 17 trillion worth of debt.\\" Moreover, the health care law might fail without Republicans going to great lengths to help it along, Coburn argued. \\"Obamacare is going to fail on its own right,\\" he said. \\"The sick people are signing up, the healthy aren't. And they're not going to because the deductibles are so high and the cost is going to be high.\\" Another prominent Republican, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, urged Republicans like Cruz to \\"have a little bit of self-restraint\\" when it comes to Obamacare, and let the law's rocky implementation speak for itself. \\"It might actually be a politically better approach to see the massive dysfunction. But we don't even hear about that because we've stepped on that message. And I think Republicans need to just take a step back and...show a little self-restraint and let this happen a little more organically,\\" Bush said. He also criticized said his party needs to present an alternative, which they haven't done. Cruz called the people advancing the let-it-fail strategy \\"Republican gray beards.\\" \\"I profoundly disagree with the message. I want to step on their message,\\" Cruz said. \\"I consider that theory the 'Bad Samaritan' theory. Basically inflict a bunch of harm on the American people and hope we benefit politically from it. What a terrible, cynical approach. I'm not interested in seeing the American people suffer just because my party might benefit politically if they blame the Democrats for the foolish policies that have been imposed,\\" he said. © 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.  i. no; ii. yes;","output":"To answer your first question, those two questions are essentially the same with a slight difference in phrasing. Both questions are asking for a way to leave a girl without causing any emotional damage. Now, let's work on the main task. Step 1: Self-reflection Reflect on your feelings and reasons for not being able to reciprocate her love. Make sure your decision to leave her is based on well-reasoned thoughts and not temporary emotions. Step 2: Show empathy Remind yourself that you care about her feelings and want to minimize any pain that she may experience due to your decision. Try to put yourself in her shoes and imagine what could be the best way to approach the situation. Step 3: Choose the right setting Find an appropriate and comfortable place to have the conversation in person. It is important for this interaction to be private, so neither of you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. Step 4: Be honest but gentle Explain to her that, despite her love and kindness, you do not feel the same way towards her. Be honest about your feelings but use gentle and compassionate language. Avoid going into detail about the specific reasons, as this can be hurtful. Step 5: Focus on your feelings and not her actions As you discuss your decision, emphasize that it is based on your feelings and emotions, not her actions or personality traits. This will help avoid placing blame on her and reduce the chances of having her feelings hurt. Step 6: Be supportive and understanding Acknowledging her emotions and being supportive can help her process the situation. Listen to what she has to say and validate her feelings, even if they are negative or sad.  Step 7: Maintain respect and dignity Throughout the conversation, it's crucial to treat her with respect and dignity. Avoid using harsh language or expressing contempt. Step 8: Offer friendship If you believe it is possible and desirable, offer to continue the relationship as friends, but be aware that it may take time for her feelings to adjust. Ensure that you genuinely want to remain friends and are not suggesting it simply to ease your conscience. Step 9: Give her space After the conversation, allow her some space and offer her the opportunity to process her emotions and come to terms with the situation. Do not push for immediate closure or expect her to understand right away. By following these steps, you can minimize the hurt she might feel during the breakup and show her the respect and consideration she deserves. Keep in mind that pain and discomfort might still arise during such conversations, but the goal is to approach the situation with empathy and respect."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Born in Drouin to Alfred and Colleen Ablett, Gary Ablett grew up in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria's Gippsland region alongside his four elder brothers and three sisters. Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Ablett combined strength, speed, and skill to produce many spectacular highlights and goal-kicking feats. A noted big game player, Ablett kicked 43 goals in 11 State appearances. More significantly, he booted 64 goals over the course of his 16 finals - an average of four goals a game. His haul of 27 goals in the 1989 finals series is a record that still stands. He was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his performance in the 1989 Grand Final, where he was adjudged best player afield. In doing so, he became one of only four players (the others being Maurice Rioli -1982, Nathan Buckley -2002, and Chris Judd -2005) to win the medal playing for the losing side. In 1996, Ablett joined Gordon Coventry, Doug Wade, Jason Dunstall and Tony Lockett as the only players in league history to kick 1000 VFL/AFL goals.  Martin Flanagan's representation of Australian football pioneer Tom Wills in his 1996 novel The Call is modeled on Ablett. According to Flanagan, Wills and Ablett polarised opinion in similar ways, and displayed a lack of insight into their actions--they simply did what came naturally to them, \\"like a lot of artists\\". Ablett is the subject of the song \\"Kicking the Footy with God\\", released by The Bedroom Philosopher on his 2005 debut album In Bed with My Doona.  In 1996, Ablett was named in the AFL Team of the Century on the interchange bench, alongside Jack Dyer and Greg Williams. In 2001, Ablett was named in the Geelong Team of the Century, on a half forward flank. In 2005, after many years of controversy and debate (see below), he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. The following year, he was honoured yet again when he was voted as the Greatest Geelong player of all-time ahead of Graham Farmer.  In 2006, Ablett was honoured with the naming of a terrace in his name within the newly renovated Skilled Stadium. Ablett once had a set of gates named in his honour, but he was upgraded to a terrace at the beginning of the 2006 AFL season. What is something about Ablett Sr.'s legacy?","output":"Ablett Sr.'s legacy includes being inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2005. \\"In 2005, after many years of controversy and debate (see below), he [Ablett Sr.] was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Later, with the help of producer Babykuttan (Mukesh), Udayabanu prepares to direct another film, but he is forced to cast Rajappan as the hero since he was the star with most screen value at that time.

The driver, Gina (Diane Kruger), rescues him and flees the scene, as she is an illegal immigrant from Bosnia. Martin regains consciousness at a hospital after having been in a coma for four days. When Martin returns to the hotel, he discovers Liz with another man, and she claims to not know him. Martin phones a colleague in the States, Prof. Rodney Cole (Frank Langella) but reaches only his voice mail. Aboard a train, Martin writes down his schedule for the next day by memory. Martin visits the office of Prof. Leo Bressler (Sebastian Koch), whom he is scheduled to meet, but sees the impostor, \\"Martin B\\" (Aidan Quinn), already there. As Martin attempts to prove his identity, Martin B shows him his ID and family photo, both of which have the impostor's face. Overwhelmed by the identity crisis, Martin falls unconscious, then finds himself back at the hospital. Smith (Olivier SchneiderÂ (fr)), an assassin sent to target Martin, kills a nurse, Gretchen Erfurt (Eva LÃ¶bau), but Martin escapes. He seeks help from Erfurt's friend, private investigator and former Stasi agent Ernst JÃ¼rgen (Bruno Ganz). Martin's only clues are his father's book on Botany and Gina, who since the crash now works at a diner. While Martin persuades Gina to help him, JÃ¼rgen digs up information related to Martin and the biotechnology summit. He discovers the summit will be attended by Prince Shada (Mido Hamada) of Saudi Arabia, who is funding a secret project headed by Bressler. Prince Shada has survived numerous assassination attempts by extremists in his own country, and JÃ¼rgen suspects that Martin's identity theft may be part of another attempt.

Given the question: Information:  - Paul Dupuy , History Lecturer at the Ecole Normale , published in 1896 the first scientific biography of the mathematician Évariste Galois , titled \`\` La vie d'Évariste Galois '' .  - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811  31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - In mathematics, especially in order theory, a Galois connection is a particular correspondence (typically) between two partially ordered sets (posets). The same notion can also be defined on preordered sets or classes; this article presents the common case of posets. Galois connections generalize the correspondence between subgroups and subfields investigated in Galois theory (named after the French mathematician Évariste Galois). They find applications in various mathematical theories.

Even those CAPA bishops who are here , they said , \\" share their concerns and feelings \\" . What church seems to be having recent issues ?","output":"The church that appears to be having recent issues is the Anglican Communion. The Anglican Communion is an international association of churches consisting of the Church of England and its various offshoots around the world, including the Episcopal Church in the United States, the Anglican Church of Canada, and several churches in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This global family of churches is united by shared traditions and beliefs, as well as a common historical heritage originating from the Church of England. However, in recent years, the Anglican Communion has faced significant challenges and internal divisions, particularly surrounding issues such as the ordination of women, the acceptance of homosexuality, and the interpretation of Scripture. These disagreements have led to strained relationships and the absence of some church leaders at international gatherings and conferences. The statement from the bishops \\"present from the CAPA (Council of Anglican Provinces of Africa) family\\" suggests that there is ongoing concern and unrest within the Anglican Communion, with some bishops feeling a deep sense of anguish and frustration over the current state of the Communion. This is particularly evident in the mention of the absence of some colleagues, who are possibly boycotting these events as a way to express their dissatisfaction with the direction the Anglican Communion is taking. The CAPA bishops also express regret over wasted opportunities, which could have led to healing and reunification within the Anglican Communion. This highlights the need for dialogue, understanding, and a dedication to finding compromise on divisive issues within the Communion. In summary, the Anglican Communion is the church that appears to be facing recent issues and internal divisions, as evidenced by the statement from the bishops of the CAPA family. The ongoing challenges faced by the Anglican Communion serve as a reminder of the importance of unity, dialogue, and compromise in addressing the complexities of a global religious community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - An airline reservation is made - The passenger arrives early at the airport - The luggage is checked - The passenger waits in line - The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass - The passenger goes to their gate - The passenger gets in line when it's time to board - The person boards the plane - The plane arrives at the destination - The passenger gets off the plane at their destination.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more passengers wait in line happens, how will it affect more passengers board the plane.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context refers to a situation in which more passengers wait in line, and it explores the possible effects this might have on the process of passengers boarding the plane. The hypothesis assumes that an increase in the number of passengers waiting in line might lead to more passengers boarding the plane. The effect of this perturbation could be evaluated in terms of direct and indirect impacts on the process of passengers boarding the plane: 1. Direct Effects: a. Longer wait times: With more passengers waiting in line to board, the overall wait times for all passengers may increase. This could delay the boarding process and potentially affect the on-time performance of the flight. b. Potential boarding complications: With more passengers in line, it's possible that some passengers may encounter issues with boarding passes, identification, or other pertinent boarding documents. This could lead to further delays in the boarding process. 2. Indirect Effects: a. Increased workload for airline staff: Handling more passengers waiting in line would put an additional burden on airline staff, including customer service, baggage handlers, and security personnel. This could lead to increased fatigue and stress among employees, which might negatively impact their performance. b. Customer dissatisfaction: The longer wait times and potential delays in boarding could lead to dissatisfaction among passengers and might influence their choice of airline in the future. In severe cases, this could affect the airline's reputation and revenue. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that an increase in the number of passengers waiting in line could lead to more passengers boarding the plane is likely to have both direct and indirect effects on the boarding process. Direct effects include longer wait times and potential boarding complications, while indirect effects involve an increased workload for airline staff and potential customer dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Part #2: Identifying the missing sentence Usage: In this context, the missing sentence is \\"Bill felt bad for Shelly\\". This would connect well in the storyline as it explains the motive behind Bill's action of writing a poem for Shelly. Part #3: Evaluating whether the given sentence serves as a connecting link  Usage: We have to judge if \\"Bill felt bad for Shelly\\" works as a link between the first sentence (which states that Shelly is sad) and the third sentence (which states that Bill writes a poem for Shelly). It is plausible because feeling sorry for Shelly could lead Bill to try to cheer her up by writing a poem. Part #4: Determining if the given sentence alters the subsequent storyline Usage: After inserting the sentence \\"Bill felt bad for Shelly\\" as the second sentence, the rest of the story continues to make sense, and the logical flow between sentences is not affected. Thus, it does not alter the main storyline. Part #5: Conveying the conclusion succinctly Usage: The instructions ask for a simple \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" response, which means they require a precise answer without any explanations or arguments. For example, given the above analysis, the correct response in this case would be \\"Yes\\" as the sentence “Bill felt bad for Shelly” does connect the first sentence with the rest of the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds a nest of goose eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David (Terry Kinney) knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her fatherâs old barn to incubate. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local game warden Glen Seifert (Jeremy Ratchford) on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have imprinted on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that all domestic geese must have their wings pinioned (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them. Thomas decides to use an ultralight aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry (Holter Graham), Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a bird sanctuary in North Carolina, and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary.

Bird was born in West Baden Springs, Indiana, to Georgia (nee Kerns) and Claude Joseph \\"Joe\\" Bird, a veteran of the Korean War. He was raised in nearby French Lick, where his mother worked two jobs to support Larry and his five siblings. Bird has said that being poor as a child still motivates him \\"to this day\\". Georgia and Joe divorced when Larry was in high school, and Joe committed suicide about a year later. Bird immediately transformed the Celtics into a title contender, helping them improve their win total by 32 games from the year before he was drafted and finish first in the Eastern Conference. With averages of 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.7 steals per game for the season, he was selected to the All-Star Team and named Rookie of the Year. In the Conference Finals, Boston was eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers.  Before the 1980-81 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors, forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come. Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the Conference Finals for a rematch with the 76ers. Boston fell behind 3-1 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets, winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship. He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals but lost out on the Finals MVP Award to teammate Cedric Maxwell.  At the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award. At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection. He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone. In the Conference Finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games. Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the Conference Semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.  In 1988, Bird had the best statistical season of his career, but the Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals. Bird started the 1988-89 season, but ended his season after six games to have bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels. He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, through the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. He averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists a game in his last three seasons with the Celtics, and shot better than 45% from the field in each. Bird led the Celtics to playoff appearances in each of those three seasons.  Bird's body, however, continued to break down. He had been bothered by back problems for years, and his back became progressively worse. After leading the Celtics to a 29-5 start to the 1990-91 season, he missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that would eventually lead to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the 1991-92 season. His past glory would be briefly rekindled, however, in a game that season in which he scored 49 points in a double-overtime victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. During the 1992 Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bird missed four of the seven games in the series due to those recurring back problems.  In the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and other NBA stars to play for the United States basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent professional basketball players to compete. The \\"Dream Team\\" won the men's basketball gold medal.  Following his Olympic experience, on August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement as an NBA player. He finished his career with averages of more than 24 points, 10 rebounds and 6 assists per game, while shooting 49.6% from the field, 88.6% from the free throw line and 37.6% from three-point range. Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.  In 1989, Bird published his autobiography, Drive: The Story of My Life with Bob Ryan. The book chronicles his life and career up to the 1989 NBA season.  The Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997. In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers and said he would be on the job for no more than three years. Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58-24 record--the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time--in the 1997-98 season, and pushed the Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals. He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts, becoming the only man in NBA history to have won both the MVP and Coach of the Year awards. He then led the Pacers to two consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000, and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. Bird will be always known for his playing in the Boston garden, but what he did in 3 years with the pacers was very remarkable and the best 3 year stretch the pacer ever had.  Bird resigned as Pacers coach shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years. In 2003, he returned as the Pacers' president of basketball operations, overseeing team personnel and coaching moves, as well as the team's draft selections. Bird promoted David Morway to general manager in 2008, but Bird still had the final say in basketball matters. After the 2011-2012 NBA season, Bird was named NBA Executive of the Year, becoming the only man in NBA history to win the NBA MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year.  On June 27, 2012, a day before the 2012 NBA draft, Bird and the Pacers announced that they would be parting ways later that year. Bird said health issues were among the reasons for his leaving. Donnie Walsh was named to replace him.  On June 26, 2013, almost exactly a year later, it was announced that Bird would be returning to the Pacers as president of basketball operations. Pacers owner Herb Simon briefly addressed Bird's prior health concerns, stating that \\"He's got his energy back, his health back and he's raring to go\\".  On May 1, 2017, Bird resigned as president of basketball operations, but stayed with the team in an advisory capacity. Entity:","output":"Larry Bird"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Donald had very little energy.. (B). Samuel had very little energy..","output":"The completion of the sentence would be \\"Donald spent a lot of time jumping rope on the playground but Samuel did not because (B) Samuel had very little energy.\\" This sentence indicates a contrast between Donald and Samuel's activities on the playground, specifically when it comes to jumping rope. The narrative set up here is that Donald is spending a lot of time jumping rope. The use of the conjunction \\"but\\" provides a context for a contrasting action or characteristic related to Samuel.  The reason for Samuel not spending as much time jumping rope on the playground is provided after the conjunction. Out of the two options provided, only option (B) provides a contrasting reason related to Samuel. \\"Samuel had very little energy\\" is an explanation that contrasts Samuel's actions with Donald's. Samuel not having as much energy would logically justify why he isn't spending a lot of time jumping rope, as jumping rope is a very energetic activity requiring considerable physical effort.  Option (A), \\"Donald had very little energy\\", contradicts the information previously presented in the sentence, which is that Donald is spending a lot of time jumping rope. The act of jumping rope typically requires a significant amount of energy, and the statement that Donald was doing this for a long time implies that he had a plentiful supply of energy.  Therefore, given the context, structure and implied meaning of the sentence, the correct completion is definitely option (B), resulting in the sentence: \\"Donald spent a lot of time jumping rope on the playground but Samuel did not because Samuel had very little energy.\\" This sentence nicely contrasts Donald's energetic activity with Samuel's lack thereof, due to his stated lower energy levels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Besides desert parsley and California goldfields, what are the most common wildflowers that grow on the Table Rocks?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.

Article: Almost everyone has dropped some food on the floor and still wanted to eat it.If someone saw you drop it, he or she might have shouted, \\" 5-second rule!\\" This so-called rule says food is OK to eat if you pick it up in five seconds or less.But is that true? Professor Anthony Hilton from Ashton University, UK, tested the rule with his students.They found that food dropped for five seconds is less likely to contain bacteria  than if it sits there for longer. For the study, Hilton and his students tested a lot of foods----bread, pasta, cookies and candy--to see how much bacteria they had when they made contact with the floor.They allowed the food to lie on the different types of flooring--carpet , laminate   and tile  -- for three seconds to 30 seconds. Not surprisingly, the longer the food was on the floor, the more bacteria it had.And the type of floor where the dropped food landed had an effect.Bacteria are least likely to transfer  from carpet, while they are most likely to transfer laminate or tiled surface after more than five seconds. The study also found that the wetter the food, the more likely it was to pick up bacteria.Although most people are happy to follow the 5-second rule, eating food dropped on the floor still carries an infection  risk.\\"It very much depends on which bacteria are on the floor at the time.\\" Hilton told Forbes. Question: According to the test, we learn the following EXCEPT   _  . Options: A: the dropped food had more bacteria if it sat on the floor for longer.

From the early 16th century, both Western Armenia and Eastern Armenia fell under Iranian Safavid rule. Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian geo-political rivalry that would last in Western Asia, significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires. From the mid 16th century with the Peace of Amasya, and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the Treaty of Zuhab until the first half of the 19th century, Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Iranian Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar empires, while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule. In the late 1820s, the parts of historic Armenia under Iranian control centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan (all of Eastern Armenia) were incorporated into the Russian Empire following Iran's forced ceding of the territories after its loss in the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) and the outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay.

Help as much as you can. Q: My mother’s first career was as a beautician. Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does igneous intrusion create?\\" is \\"loose soil\\", given that  igneous intrusion creates valuable products? A:","output":"Igneous intrusions, formed through the process of magma from the Earth's mantle intruding and solidifying within the Earth's crust, play a significant role in shaping our planet's geological features and producing valuable resources. Although \\"loose soil\\" is not the primary result of igneous intrusion, there are indeed valuable products formed through this process. Let me explain in detail: First, let's discuss the intrusions themselves. When magma solidifies beneath the Earth's surface, it creates various types of igneous rocks. The most common types include plutonic (formed at great depth) and volcanic (formed at shallower depths) rocks, such as granite, basalt, and diorite. These rocks often possess valuable minerals and elements, and are used in construction and other industries. Furthermore, igneous intrusions can lead to the formation or concentration of valuable resources. For example: 1. Mineral deposits: Intruding magma can carry a wide array of minerals, such as copper, gold, silver, and platinum. As the magma cools, these minerals may begin to crystallize and concentrate, forming mineral deposits. These deposits can eventually be mined and extracted for their valuable resources. 2. Geothermal energy: The heat from magma intrusions can produce geothermal reservoirs by warming the surrounding rocks and fluids. This trapped heat can be harnessed through geothermal power plants to generate electricity, providing a renewable and sustainable source of energy. 3. Metamorphism: When intruding magma comes into contact with existing rock, the heat and pressure can cause the original rock to undergo metamorphic changes, leading to the formation of new metamorphic rocks. Some common examples of metamorphic rocks include marble and quartzite, which can be used for construction, sculpting, and various other purposes. 4. Ores: The cooling of intruding magma can cause the formation of veins, where hydrothermal fluids dissolve and deposit valuable minerals. This process leads to the generation of metal ores, such as gold, silver, copper, and other valuable metallic resources. To summarize, igneous intrusion does not directly create \\"loose soil.\\" However, it does play a significant role in creating valuable products, such as various types of rocks, minerals, and energy resources, which can greatly benefit the economies and industries of our world. It is crucial to understand these processes and their implications within the fields of geology and resource development."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are decrease or increase ):  A stronger acid produces a greater concentration of ions than a weaker acid.

(CNN) -- There were so many golden moments at the London 2012 Games, but for me, the moment that Team GB's Mo Farah won the 10,000 meters was a wonderful collision of electricity. I was performing stand up, downstairs at the Soho Theatre in London -- I was about fifteen minutes in to the gig when I heard the whole of the cool and trendy Soho district of London explode into noise. I ran offstage to get my iPhone and I got the BBC live feed streaming just in time to see Mo Farah hugging his American training partner, Galen Rupp, who took silver. I was recounting all this live on stage to the audience. That was quite a moment of running, internet technology and 'where were you when?' rolled into one.

Sal owned a popular pizza restaurant in New York. 2. One night, his store was burglarized and all of his cooking equipment was stolen. 3.

The popularity of Sal's Pizza may imply that it had a strong customer base and was a well-liked establishment, but this does not necessarily mean it was the smallest pizza restaurant in New York. The context does not include any particulars about its size, seating capacity, or the number of employees. Additionally, the burglary and theft of cooking equipment, as well as the community's support, are not relevant factors when determining the size of a restaurant.

Dallas Cowboys nose tackle Josh Brent was arrested on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter after a Mercedes he was driving in Irving, Texas, flipped and caught fire early Saturday morning, killing teammate Jerry Brown Jr., police said. Brent's car was allegedly traveling at a high speed when it hit a curb, according to Irving police, who said officers on the scene \\"believed alcohol was a contributing factor in the crash.\\" The car traveled about 900 feet after hitting the curb, said police spokesman John Argumaniz. When officers came upon the scene, Brent was dragging Brown from the car, he said. The 25-year-old passenger was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Brent, 24, in his third season with the team, was booked into the Irving City Jail on one count of intoxication manslaughter -- considered a second-degree felony that carries a potential two- to 20-year prison sentence with a maximum 10,000 fine. Brent pleaded guilty to a DUI charge in 2009, according to court records in Champaign, Illinois. The records list Brent, who played football with Brown at the University of Illinois, as Joshua Price-Brent, the same name listed in the Irving police report. The athlete got a 60-day sentence, a fine and 200 hours of community service.

Brown was an outside linebacker on the Dallas practice squad, having been released by the Indianapolis Colts in October. News of Brown's death prompted a flurry of online comments from former classmates and coaches at Illinois. Arrelious Benn tweeted: \\"Prayers go out to the family of my former classmate, teammate Former Illini Jerry Brown.

The most common of these are the piano, organ, and various electronic keyboards, including synthesizers and digital pianos. Other keyboard instruments include celestas, which are struck idiophones operated by a keyboard, and carillons, which are usually housed in bell towers or belfries of churches or municipal buildings.  - Sly and the Family Stone was an American band from San Francisco. Active from 1966 to 1983, the band was pivotal in the development of funk, soul, rock, and psychedelic music. The group's core line-up was led by singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and featured Stone's brother and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone, sister and singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Gregg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham. The band was the first major American rock group to have an \\"integrated, multi-gender\\" lineup.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Sly Stone (born Sylvester Stewart, March 15, 1943, Denton, Texas) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, most famous for his role as frontman for Sly and the Family Stone, a band which played a critical role in the development of soul, funk, rock, and psychedelia in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1993, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the group.  - The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.  - Larry Graham, Jr. (born August 14, 1946) is an American bass guitar player, both with the psychedelic soul/funk band Sly and the Family Stone, and as the founder and frontman of Graham Central Station. He is credited with the invention of the slapping technique, which radically expanded the tonal palette of the bass, although he himself refers to the technique as \\"thumpin' and pluckin'\\".  - Cynthia Robinson (January 12, 1944  November 23, 2015) was an American musician, best known for being the trumpeter and vocalist in Sly and the Family Stone. Her voice and presence were featured in the hit \\"Dance To The Music\\".  - Stevland Hardaway Morris (born Stevland Hardaway Judkins; May 13, 1950), known by his stage name Stevie Wonder, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist. A child prodigy, he is considered to be one of the most critically and commercially successful musical performers of the late 20th century. Wonder signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11, and he continued performing and recording for Motown into the 2010s. He has been blind since shortly after birth.  - A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated.  - A chord progression or harmonic progression is a succession of musical chords. Chord progressions are the foundation of harmony in Western musical tradition.  - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - Rose \`\` Rosie '' Stone ( born Rosemary Stewart ; March 21 , 1945 ) is an African - American singer and keyboardist . She is best known as one of the lead singers in Sly and the Family Stone , a popular psychedelic soul / funk band founded by her brothers , Sly Stone and Freddie Stone . She often wore a platinum - colored wig while performing with the band , and was noted for her strong vocals .

Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or an intersex variation which may complicate sex assignment), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity. Some cultures have specific gender roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the hijra (chhaka) of India and Pakistan.  - Soul music (often referred to simply as soul) is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States; where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in the civil rights era. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.  - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.  - The 5th Dimension is an American popular music vocal group, whose repertoire includes pop, R&B, soul, jazz, light opera and Broadwaythe melange was coined as \\"Champagne Soul.\\"  - The Chambers Brothers are an American soul band, best known for its eleven-minute long 1968 hit \\"Time Has Come Today\\".

Their music has been kept alive through heavy use in film soundtracks.  - Vet Stone (born Vaetta Stewart; May 2, 1950, Vallejo, California) is an African-American soul singer.  - In music, extended chords are tertian chords (built from thirds) or triads with notes \\"extended\\", or added, beyond the seventh. Ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords are extended chords. The thirteenth is the farthest extension diatonically possible as, by that point, all seven tonal degrees are represented within the chord. In practice however, extended chords do not typically use all the chord members; when it is not altered, the fifth is often omitted, as are notes between the seventh and the highest note (i.e., the ninth is often omitted in an eleventh chord; the ninth and eleventh are usually omitted in a thirteenth chord), unless they are altered to give a special texture. See chord alteration.  - The Supremes were an American female singing group and the premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s. Founded as the Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, HollandDozierHolland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity, and it is said that their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success.  - A melody (\\"singing, chanting\\"), also tune, voice, or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color. It may be considered the foreground to the background accompaniment. A line or part need not be a foreground melody.  - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\"  part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor  has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A keyboardist is a musician who plays keyboard instruments. Until the early 1960s musicians who played keyboards were generally classified as either pianists or organists. Since the mid-1960s, a plethora of new musical instruments with keyboards have come into common usage, requiring a more general term for a person who plays them. These keyboards include:  - Freddie Stone (born Frederick Stewart, June 5, 1947, Vallejo, California, United States) is an African-American pastor and musician, best known for his role as co-founder, guitarist, and vocalist in the band Sly and the Family Stone, the frontman for which was his brother Sly Stone. His sisters Rosie Stone and Vet Stone were also members of the band.  - Funkadelic is an American band that was most prominent during the 1970s. The band and its sister act Parliament, both led by George Clinton, pioneered the funk music culture of that decade.  - Psychedelia is a name given to the subculture of people, originating in the 1960s, who often use psychedelic drugs such as LSD, mescaline and peyote. The term is also used to describe a style of psychedelic artwork and psychedelic music. Psychedelic art and music typically try to recreate or reflect the experience of altered consciousness. Psychedelic art uses highly distorted and surreal visuals, bright colors and full spectrums and animation (including cartoons) to evoke and convey to a viewer or listener the artist's experience while using such drugs, or to enhance the experience of a user of these drugs. Psychedelic music uses distorted electric guitar, Indian music elements such as the sitar, electronic effects, sound effects and reverberation, and elaborate studio effects, such as playing tapes backwards or panning the music from one side to another. The term \\"psychedelic\\" is derived from the Ancient Greek words \\"psych\\" (, \\"soul\\") and \\"dloun\\" (, \\"to make visible, to reveal\\"), translating to \\"soul-revealing\\".  - Bebop or bop is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States, which features songs characterized by a fast tempo, complex chord progressions with rapid chord changes and numerous changes of key, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, the use of scales and occasional references to the melody.  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - Denton is a city in and the county seat of Denton County, Texas. As of the 2010 United States Census, its population was 113,383, making it the 27th most populous city in Texas and the 11th-largest city in the DallasFort Worth metroplex.  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.  - Psychedelic soul, sometimes called black rock, is a subgenre of soul music, which mixes the characteristics of soul with psychedelia. It came to prominence in the late 1960s and continued into the 1970s, playing a major role in the development of funk and disco. Pioneering acts included Sly and the Family Stone and the Temptations. Mainstream acts that developed a psychedelic sound included the Supremes and Stevie Wonder. Acts that achieved notability with the sound included The Chambers Brothers, The 5th Dimension, Edwin Starr and George Clinton's Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles.  - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.  - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.  - Edwin Starr (January 21, 1942April 2, 2003) was an American soul singer. Starr is famous for his Norman Whitfield-produced Motown singles of the 1970s, most notably the number one hit \\"War\\".  - Psychedelic music (sometimes psychedelia) covers a range of popular music styles and genres influenced by the 1960s psychedelic culture, a subculture of people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and DMT to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, synesthesia and altered states of consciousness. Psychedelic music attempted to replicate the hallucinogenic experience of using these drugs or enhance the experience of using them. Psychedelic music emerged during the mid-1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United States and Britain.    What is the relationship between 'rose stone' and 'vallejo'?

In parts of Derbyshire, only one in 20 young people progressed to university in 2015, compared with more than 80% in parts of Buckinghamshire, it says. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said the figures were improving. \\"Recent UCAS data shows that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to go to university than ever before, but we agree there is more to do,\\" said Mr Johnson. The study drew on figures from the Higher Education Funding Council for England to highlight the area of Shirebrook in Derbyshire, where just 4.8% of young people started university in 2015. By contrast, the area with the highest university entrants was Gerrards Cross North in Buckinghamshire, at 87.2%. On average, the researchers found that in the most deprived 10% of postcodes about 20% of young people went to university in 2015, compared with about half of those in the least deprived 10%. In the report, Teach First says young people from the poorest backgrounds are constantly held back by social mobility hurdles their wealthier peers do not face. Figures from the Office of Fair Access to Higher Education (OFFA) show that universities in England spent Â£725m in 2015-16 on measures to help more disadvantaged students get into university - but the report asks if the money could be spent more effectively. It suggests that a proportion should be targeted on boosting participation in \\"hard to reach\\" communities, with schemes to encourage primary-aged children to aim at degrees. It also suggests that the government could encourage teachers to take jobs in schools in low-achieving areas by forgiving a proportion of their student loans. Teach First chief executive Brett Wigdortz said that \\"for those that choose that path, [university] gives them a huge range of social, cultural and economic benefits and, for the time being it's still the gateway for most high-status professions. \\"However, today there are still far too few disadvantaged pupils getting to university and completing their degree.\\" Prof Les Ebdon, Director of OFFA said: \\"The grades young people get at school have a huge impact on their ability to access higher education. So it is a real cause for concern that the gap in attainment between pupils from different backgrounds can be seen from such a young age.\\" Mr Johnson said the government's higher education reforms aimed to ensure that universities \\"look beyond just access - and focus on attainment, retention rates and readiness for the world of work. \\"This includes a new duty requiring universities to publish data broken down by background, to shine a light on where more must be done to tackle inequality. \\"The  Teaching Excellence Framework will also explicitly look at how they are achieving positive outcomes for disadvantaged students.\\" The study was written jointly with Credit Suisse's EMEA education foundation.","output":"A new study by charity Teach First reveals that university participation rates are significantly lower in the UK's poorest areas, with only one in 20 young people attending university in parts of Derbyshire, compared to over 80% in some regions of Buckinghamshire."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which village took a more complex approach to rural development?  Two rural communities from Jones county took different approaches on rural development as a means of adapting to increasing urbanization. Kent village remained  traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. Long Grove on the other hand took a wider perspective and created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all played an important role in developing Long Grove village.  Hint: Rural development is the process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in rural areas, often relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas.[1]  Rural development has traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.[2] The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions.[3] Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies.[4] In contrast to urban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive from one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally.[5]  Rural development is a comprehensive term. It essentially focuses on action for the development of areas outside the mainstream urban economic system. we should think of what type of rural development is needed because modernization of village leads to urbanization and village environment disappears. Answer:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, Long Grove village took a more complex approach to rural development. Unlike Kent village, which remained traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry, Long Grove focused on a broad range of development goals. These goals included education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure, which all played an important role in developing Long Grove village.

The official profile of the 36-year-old American former actor on the palace website lists her achievements, even highlighting her quote from the 2015 United Nations conference in New York: “I am proud to be a woman and a feminist.”            Is Meghan Markle the American the royals needed all along? | Hadley Freeman Read more      The website says that from a young age, the duchess has had “a keen awareness of social issues and actively participated in charitable work. Aged 11 she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid”.      It says she volunteered in a soup kitchen in Skid Row in Los Angeles and “these early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment”.      Her charitable work also features prominently, noting that she became the UN women’s advocate for women’s political participation and leadership in 2015 and in the following year she was made global ambassador for the charity World Vision.      As Windsor began to return to normality, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex returned to their Kensington Palace home.      It had, by all accounts, been a late night for the bride and groom with their private evening reception at the 17th-century Frogmore House ending with an explosion of fireworks.            Breaking with tradition, the duchess gave a speech in which she is thought to have thanked the royal family for welcoming her into the fold. Prince Harry reportedly told guests he and his wife made “such a great team” and, turning to her, said: “I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”            The private dinner for 200 was hosted by Prince Charles, with the TV host James Corden said to have compered the evening’s entertainment which included DJ Sam Totolee. There was a “drinks of the world”-themed bar, a dinner, then candy floss and “dirty burgers” at midnight, according to reports.            The newlyweds had arrived in a classic E-type Jaguar, lent by Prince Charles and featuring the registration E190518 – their wedding date. The duchess had changed into a Stella McCartney dress while the duke wore black tie.            Earlier an estimated 100,000 people had lined Windsor’s streets for a glimpse of the bride and groom on their carriage procession following the noon service at St George’s Chapel, at Windsor Castle.

The identity of the wedding dress designer, British-born Clare Waight Keller at the French fashion house Givenchy, remained a secret until the moment the bride stepped out of her bridal car at the chapel.            Keller said she had not even told her husband or children. Speaking on Sunday, she revealed Harry came straight over to her after the ceremony and said: “Oh my God, thank you. She looks absolutely stunning.”      Keller said: “Well, I think everybody saw on television – he was absolutely in awe I think. She looked just incredible and it showed.” She said the duchess was “just glowing” after the ceremony.      Asked why she thought she had been chosen to create the gown, which will go down in fashion history, she said: “I think she really admired the fact that I was a woman designer and the many companies I’ve worked for – British companies and international companies. And the fact that I’m a working mother maybe played into that as well, so that was maybe part of her story.”            As the royal couple, who will not go on honeymoon immediately, returned to London, a major clean-up was under way in Windsor. Barriers were taken down, and trucks and lorries lined the streets as the international TV networks packed up and moved out and rubbish collectors moved in.       ||||| MEGHAN Markle’s nephew sparked a police probe just hours after the wedding by trying to take a knife into a London nightclub — and blamed Donald Trump.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards difference is there between T.J. Duckett's longest touchdown run and shortest?","output":"Title: Analyzing the Yardage Difference Between T.J. Duckett's Longest and Shortest Touchdown Runs Introduction: In the world of professional football, the performance of a player can sometimes be measured by comparing specific attributes and statistics. One such comparison is between the longest and shortest touchdown runs by a running back. T.J. Duckett, a former NFL running back, enjoyed a decent career during his tenure. This article seeks to answer the question, \\"How many yards difference is there between T.J. Duckett's longest touchdown run and shortest?\\" Analyzing T.J. Duckett's Career: T.J. Duckett, born February 17, 1981, was an American football running back who played for several NFL teams, including the Atlanta Falcons, Washington Redskins, Detroit Lions, and Seattle Seahawks. He was a first-round draft pick in the 2002 NFL Draft, selected by the Atlanta Falcons. During his professional football career, Duckett made a name for himself as a powerful and agile running back, showcasing the ability to escape tackles and rumble down the field. Step 1: Research T.J. Duckett's Longest and Shortest Touchdown Runs To determine the yardage difference between Duckett's longest and shortest touchdown runs, we must first identify these particular plays. According to the NFL's official website, T.J. Duckett's longest touchdown run occurred on November 24, 2002, while he was playing for the Atlanta Falcons in a game against the Carolina Panthers. During this game, Duckett broke free for a stunning 70-yard touchdown run. For Duckett's shortest touchdown run, we need to look for goal-line carries where he managed to push himself into the end zone. While there were numerous instances where he punched in from the 1-yard line, for the sake of measuring the shortest distance, let us assume that on at least one of those occasions, the ball was snapped from the 1-yard line, and Duckett managed to cross the plane of the end zone in a single yard. Step 2: Determine the Yardage Difference Now that we have identified T.J. Duckett's longest (70 yards) and shortest (1 yard) touchdown runs, we can calculate the difference between the two distances. Yardage Difference = Longest Touchdown Run - Shortest Touchdown Run Yardage Difference = 70 yards - 1 yard Yardage Difference = 69 yards Conclusion: After careful analysis, we can conclude that the yardage difference between T.J. Duckett's longest and shortest touchdown runs is 69 yards. This remarkable difference showcases the range and versatility of Duckett's ability as a running back during his NFL career, making him a key player for the teams he represented."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Aside from his family, Wolf's only friend is the local policeman Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) who bears an artificial arm, his real arm having been \\"ripped out by the roots\\" in an encounter with the Monster as a child. While investigating his father's castle, Wolf meets Ygor (BÃ©la Lugosi), a demented blacksmith who has survived a hanging for graverobbing and has a deformed neck as a result. Wolf finds the Monster's comatose body in the crypt where his grandfather and father were buried; his father's sarcophagus bears the phrase \\"Henrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters\\" written in chalk. He decides to revive the Monster to prove his father was right, and to restore honor to his family. Wolf uses the torch to scratch out the word \\"Monsters\\" on the casket and write \\"Men\\" beside it. When the Monster (Boris Karloff) is revived, it only responds to Ygor's commands and commits a series of murders; the victims were all jurors at Ygor's trial. Wolf discovers this and confronts Ygor. Wolf shoots Ygor and apparently kills him. The Monster abducts Wolf's son as revenge, but cannot bring himself to kill the child. Krogh and Wolf pursue the Monster to the nearby laboratory, where a struggle ensues, during which the Monster tears out Krogh's false arm. Wolf swings on a rope and knocks the Monster into a molten sulphur pit under the laboratory, saving his son.

A graduate student named Bellingham (played by Steve Buscemi) has been cheated by two classmates, Susan (Julianne Moore), and Lee (Robert Sedgwick), who framed him for theft to ruin his chances of winning a scholarship for which they were competing. As revenge, Bellingham reanimates a mummy and uses it to murder them both. Susan's brother Andy (Christian Slater) kidnaps Bellingham, and burns the parchment and mummy. He considers killing Bellingham, but in the end cannot bring himself to commit real murder. However, Bellingham brings Susan and Lee back from the dead (having switched the reanimation parchment with a similar one) and dispatches them to Andy's dorm, where they greet the terrified Andy by saying that Bellingham sends his regards. Cat from Hell[edit] In the second tale, George A. Romero adapts a Stephen King short story of the same name. Drogan is a wealthy, wheelchair-bound old man (William Hickey) who brings in a hitman named Halston (David Johansen) for a bizarre hire: kill a black cat, which Drogan believes is murderously evil. Drogan explains that there were three other occupants of his house before the cat arrived: his sister, Amanda (Dolores Sutton), her friend Carolyn (Alice Drummond), and the family's butler, Richard Gage (Mark Margolis). Drogan claims that one by one, the cat killed the other three, and that he is next. Drogan's pharmaceutical company killed 5,000 cats while testing a new drug, and he is convinced that this black cat is here to exact cosmic revenge. Halston doesn't believe the story,...

To answer this question, first let's understand the scenario: 1. Two ponds: Hill pond and Mound pond. 2. Both were stocked with adult fish last year. 3. Hill pond had a favorable winter, and fish reproduced normally (implying successful release of gametes into the water). 4. Mound pond had no fish reproducing this spring (this implies a lack or failure of gamete release into the water). Justification: Since there is no indication of any reproduction in the Mound pond, and if no fish are reproducing, that means no* (or fewer) fish are releasing their gametes into the water. On the other hand, in Hill pond, fish started reproducing normally, meaning they are successfully releasing their gametes resulting in successful reproduction.

The often misunderstood Zabriskie Point is Antonioni's political film, Antonioni's American film. Stylistically, it follows suit after \\"Blow-Up\\", meaning that the pace is faster than the previous epics, though certainly no less idiosyncratic. Basically the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation. Not so. The two protagonists come from vastly different environments. Mark from the \\"rebel\\" youths, Daria from an estate agency corporation. But in true Antonioni fashion, they are both alienated, both trying to escape their surroundings. Mark leaves a meeting of rebel students and Black Panthers disappointed with the verbose empty rhetoric, while Daria keeps uneasily being on the move with her car. Antionioni, the master director, after portraying the rebelling youth as confused and shallow, then moves to the city. An environment saturated by corporatism, billboard advertisements, meaninglessness, that has to keep expanding to accommodate the similar expansion of the population, generating a profit at the same time. It is this environment that the two protagonists escape from, though it seems mostly out of coincidence. Indeed, when Daria stops by a small village in the outskirts of the desert, the environment is just as suffocating, and the people just as lost cases, best exemplified by an old boxing champion, now reduced to a shadow of himself, sitting around drinking and smoking and talking nonsense. A stunning melancholy sequence, made even more powerful with the inclusion of some half wild children living around, brought in by some \\"benefactor\\" but \\"destroying a genuine piece of American history\\". In a not-so-obscure symbolism, there is Antonioni's opinion on the hippies. Just a half-positive glimpse in the canvas of human alienation. And then there is the desert, the landscape used to devastating effect, by turns pure and terrifying, primeval, wild and dead. The sequence where the two protagonists make love, \\"joined\\" in fantasy by the \\"flower\\" generation reflects the similar sequence in \\"Red Desert\\", where Giuliana tells her son a story. It is a colourful intermission in a colourless landscape. A vivid half-fantasy in a suffocating reality. The ending probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in cinema, the Western civilization blown to pieces. A catharsis, an exorcism. Antionioni's two \\"international\\" films (the British \\"Blow-Up\\" and the American \\"Zabriskie Point\\") are lesser efforts than the previous masterpieces, but that is largely because of the faster pace and the inevitably contrived settings (swinging London, flower-power America).

Answer the following question: This article: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English:  chy-KOF-skee; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский, tr. Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was honored in 1884 and awarded with a lifetime pension?, what is it ?

Question: Why did Kenny fall asleep holding George's gun? Title: A Single Man Movie plot: Taking place over the course of a single day, November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban missile crisis, A Single Man is the story of George Falconer (Colin Firth), a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George. George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up alone in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. George gets up and while watching Kenny discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, taken from the desktop, to keep George from committing suicide.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up - A dry ravine is left -","output":"The missing first step of the process involving the formation of a ravine from a stream is as follows: - A water stream forms from precipitation, melting snow, groundwater discharge, or other sources. Below is the complete sequence of the process now: 1. A water stream forms from precipitation, melting snow, groundwater discharge, or other sources. 2. Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock. 3. Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through. 4. After many years the river may dry up. 5. A dry ravine is left. Let's go through these steps to explain the process more clearly: 1. A water stream forms from precipitation, melting snow, groundwater discharge, or other sources: When water accumulates from various sources, such as rain, melting snow, or groundwater discharge, it flows downhill due to gravity. This movement of water forms a small stream, which is the starting point for the formation of a ravine. 2. Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock: As the water flows over the soil and bedrock, it gradually erodes and breaks down its path. The erosive power of the water is determined by its velocity, the volume of flow, and the composition of the soil and rock it's moving over. 3. Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through: Over time, as erosion continues, the stream will gradually wear away more and more of the earth beneath it. This process can be slow or rapid, depending on factors such as the strength of the rock, the slope of the terrain, and the amount of water flowing through the stream. Eventually, a deep gash will be cut into the ground. 4. After many years the river may dry up: There are several reasons why a river or stream might dry up over time. Some possible reasons include climate change, reduced precipitation, loss of groundwater recharge, and human activity, such as over-extraction of water or the construction of dams. As the water source diminishes, the river's capacity to erode will also decrease. It may eventually cease to flow altogether, leaving behind the exposed ravine. 5. A dry ravine is left: With the stream now gone, the ravine that formed over time remains as a testament to the erosive power of water. These dry ravines can be found in various landscapes and they serve as important markers of past geological processes. They may also continue to morph and change over time, as influenced by other factors, such as weather events, wind erosion, or human interventions."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: wrong design and did not fit my sink Product review: the picture of the strainer appeared to be the correct one for my sink. however, it was not the correct size and did not fit my sink.

So, you can give it orders in your mother tongue. But how could a cell phone or a computer \\"hear\\" what you are saying and understand it? This is all because of voice recognition technology. When you speak, your voice creates vibrations   in the air - a bit like waves in the water when you throw a rock into the lake. The microphone receives the vibrations and the computer changes them into digital data that is then divided into many parts. They are analyzed one by one to see what pronunciations each part stands for. The computer then puts these pronunciations together into possible words according to its built-in dictionary. But figuring out the words is far from enough; building words into meaningful sentences is the most difficult part. The computer has to compare what it hears to a large library of known phrases and sentences to determine what the user is saying. However, people don't always talk in the most standard way and sometimes make grammatical mistakes.

Write an article with the title: \\"Russian air base in Syria packing up\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"The Russian Air Base in Syria: Entering a New Phase of Disengagement\\" In a move that marks a significant shift in the ongoing geopolitical dynamics in the Middle Eastern region, the Russian air base in Syria is reportedly packing up. The Hmeimim Air Base, located in the Lattakia province of Syria, is a primary defense installation that has been instrumental in Russia's military engagement in the Syrian Civil War. Beginnings and Crucial Role To properly understand the magnitude of this development, it is essential to revisit the circumstances under which the Russian air base was established in Syria. Following an official request from the Syrian government for military assistance against various rebel and Islamist groups in 2015, Russia launched its air campaign. The Hmeimim Air Base, which was leased to Russia under a free of cost agreement, quickly became the operational hub of Russia's aerial missions in the region. Russian military aircraft launched from the Hmeimim base have played a vital role in bolstering the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s President, often helping tip the balance of power in favor of the government forces. Moreover, the aircraft have been instrumental in Russia's strategic bombing campaign against the Islamic State and other jihadist groups. The Reasons for Packing up Several factors have contributed to Russia's decision to start the process of disengagement from the Hmeimim Air Base. First, it's been almost six years since the Russian intervention began, and much has changed in the region. The Islamic State, a significant enemy, has been radically weakened and no longer poses the existential threat it did in 2015. Despite ongoing tensions, the Assad government has managed to retain its hold on power, lessening the necessity for a constant Russian military presence. Second, this move should be seen in the context of Russia's broader foreign policy, which often involves a measure of pragmatism. As the Syrian conflict gradually shifts towards a potential resolution, the Kremlin seems inclined to decrease its direct involvement and instead rely more on diplomatic negotiations. Temporary or Permanent? It's noteworthy to mention that this is not the first time Russian forces have started packing up in Syria. In the past, Russia had announced multiple drawdowns, only to bolster its forces later when necessary. Hence, though the current situation suggests a winding down of operations, it doesn't incontrovertibly signal permanent disengagement. Factors such as the evolving political landscape and regional security situation could lead to a reversal of the current course. Implications and Prospects  This move by Russia holds immense implications, both regionally and internationally. Regionally, it might be seen as a signal to the Assad regime that while Russia will continue supporting it diplomatically, it has started to scale back direct military aid. Armed Syrian rebel factions and neighboring countries might interpret this as a sign of declining Russian influence. Internationally, this move might aid Russian efforts to improve relations with the West. By demonstrating a willingness to decrease military involvement in Syria, Russia could be signalling its intention to help instigate a peaceful resolution to the Syrian conflict, a position that might find favor with Western powers. In conclusion, the packing up of the Russian Air Base in Syria signals a new stage in Russia's involvement within the region. While it forms part of Russia's evolving strategies, whether this indicates a permanent disengagement or a temporary respite remains uncertain. Despite the changing dynamics, Russia's strategic influence over the Syrian conflict, whether direct or indirect, isn't likely to end anytime soon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"To provide a comprehensive answer, we must first look into the life, works, and accolades of both Alan Sillitoe and James Jones and then assess their awards to determine who won more for their writing. Alan Sillitoe (1928-2010) was a British writer who rose to prominence in the mid-20th century. He was an influential figure in the \\"Angry Young Men\\" literary movement, a group of British writers characterized by their disillusionment with the post-war society and focus on working-class lives. Sillitoe's most famous works include \\"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\\" (1958) and \\"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\\" (1959). Over the course of his career, Sillitoe received several awards and honors for his writing, some of which include: 1. The Authors' Club First Novel Award for \\"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\\" (1958) - This award recognizes the most promising first novel of the year by a British author. 2. The Hawthornden Prize for \\"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\\" (1959) - This British literary award is for \\"imaginative literature\\" in either poetry or prose. 3. The Soviet Union's Order of Friendship award (1968) - While not strictly a literary award, this accolade acknowledged Sillitoe's strong association with Soviet literature and his dedication to forging cultural bridges between the UK and Russia. James Jones (1921-1977) was an American author, widely known for his war novels, with his most celebrated works being \\"From Here to Eternity\\" (1951), \\"Some Came Running\\" (1957), and \\"The Thin Red Line\\" (1962). Jones drew from his experiences in the army to create realistic narratives with insightful portrayals of ordinary soldiers' lives. Some of the prominent awards and honors Jones received throughout his career are: 1. The National Book Award for Fiction, for \\"From Here to Eternity\\" (1952) - An American literary award intended to recognize the best works of fiction by American authors. 2. The O. Henry Award, Third Prize for 'The King', published in 'The New Voices' (1954) - This short story award is prestigious and given to outstanding works that showcase the best literary craftsmanship. 3. The Charlie Chaplin Award for Best Foreign Novel for \\"The Thin Red Line\\" (1963) - This French literary award celebrates the best foreign novels released in France. Comparing their awards, both Alan Sillitoe and James Jones received numerous accolades and critical acclaim for their work. However, considering only awards specifically granted for their writing, Sillitoe has two major literary awards while Jones has three. Consequently, it can be concluded that James Jones won more awards for his writing in comparison to Alan Sillitoe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jakubowski is believed to have stolen at least 16 guns, including two or more assault rifles, in a break-in at the Armageddon Supplies gun shop in Janesville Tuesday night. His car was found on fire around 30 minutes after the theft. Authorities say that before he disappeared, Jakubowski sent a 161-page manifesto to President Trump that was full of \\"anti-religion sentiment\\" and a \\"laundry list\\" of grievances against the government and upper class. Jakubowski has been \\"highly agitated by national politics\\" and \\"believes that the government, and law enforcement in particular, are acting as terrorists and are enslaving the people,\\" says Rock County Sheriff Robert Spoden, per the Janesville Gazette.

He is the quarterback of his school's football team, student council president and one of the top students in his class.  But he hasn't forgotten his Lakota Sioux root. Unlike most children on the reservation , he keeps his hair long, a symbol of strength, and he performs at powwows , traditionally known as wacipis, where he is a champion of the traditional Lakota dance. Robert was inspired to start dancing by his grandfather, John Tail, who had a small role in the famous film about Indian Amercans, Dances with Wolves. Six years ago, John passed away, and Robert wears little wolves on his clothes in his memory.  We are told that his last name, \\" Looks Twice\\", came about because his ancestors were cautious and always took a second look.  Robert lives in a trailer with his grandmother, uncle and eight other cousins. When he gives us a tour, the trailer is falling apart. \\" It is getting ready to cave in ,\\" says Robert about the kitchen floor. The family also put trash bags on the ceiling, because it's leaking. \\" When it rains it gets all my shirts wet,\\" he says of another leak in his bedroom. Often the electricity goes off and the family have to use the burners on the stove to heat the house.  This kind of poverty is typical of the reservation. The reservation is the third poorest county in America, and Robert's community, Manderson, is known for its high crime rate. But despite all the temptations of drugs and alcohol around him, Robert remain focused on being the first person in his family to go to college and then a very big dream.  \\" I want to be the first Native American President,\\" Robert said. \\" I want to build better houses and clean up the reservation, because it's bad.

Based on the sentence \\"Three asian children, 2 boys and a girl, is sitting and studying in a classroom that is painted light green.\\", is the sentence \\"Three children sit and study.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Three children sit and study.\\" is indeed a true sentence based on the initial information \\"Three Asian children, 2 boys and a girl, are sitting and studying in a classroom that is painted light green.\\" Despite the more specific details provided in the original sentence, the second statement still holds true when derived from the first.  Let's break it down to better understand how exactly the brief sentence fits as a true depiction of the longer sentence: 1. \\"Three children\\": The original sentence provides details about three Asian children - two boys and one girl. While the specific details about their ethnicity and genders are eliminated in the shorter sentence, the key detail about there being three children remains consistent. It still accurately refers to the three children described in the first statement.  2. \\"Sit and study\\": The original sentence indicates that these children are sitting and studying in a classroom. This condition continues to hold true in the latter statement, where it simply says, \\"sit and study.\\" Again, while it has been stripped of specific contextual details about their location (classroom) and the color of the room (light green), the primary action of the children - sitting and studying - remains unspecified yet true. In summary, while the shorter sentence does not contain all the specific details present in the original sentence, it retains the key elements about the number of children and their action.

Process:  - Blood is sent to the liver - The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The blood is cleaned - Energy is produced - The blood leaves the liver cleaned.  suppose You have less strong genetic makeup happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"A less strong genetic makeup can have significant effects on the liver and its ability to function efficiently. If we consider this scenario, the supposed perturbation could be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. Blood is sent to the liver: The heart pumps blood to the liver, where it is filtered and processed. A less strong genetic makeup may result in reduced blood flow or compromised liver function. Although the genetic makeup would not directly affect this step, it would influence the efficiency of the liver in processing the blood that arrives. 2. The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood: The liver synthesizes and secretes various chemicals, enzymes, and proteins to filter toxins, metabolize nutrients, and remove harmful substances from the bloodstream. A less strong genetic makeup may lead to deficiencies in the production or function of these essential molecules, indirectly impairing this step of the process. 3. The blood is cleaned: As the liver processes the blood, it breaks down harmful substances and prepares them for elimination. A less resilient genetic makeup may result in the liver struggling to effectively perform this function, possibly leading to a buildup of toxins or waste products in the bloodstream. 4. Energy is produced: The liver plays a significant role in energy production by metabolizing carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. It helps maintain a balanced level of blood sugar through glycogen storage and glucose release. A weaker genetic makeup may cause the liver to function less efficiently in this process, thereby indirectly affecting energy levels. 5. The blood leaves the liver cleaned: Once the blood has been processed, it exits the liver and circulates throughout the body to supply nutrients and remove waste. If the liver has not efficiently cleared the blood due to a less strong genetic makeup, it could indirectly impact this step. As a result, the blood may not be adequately cleansed, and overall health may be affected. In summary, a less strong genetic makeup may not directly impact a particular step in the liver's process of filtering and cleansing the blood, but it could indirectly affect the efficiency and effectiveness of each step. This indirect effect may cause the liver to work harder to compensate for genetic weaknesses, potentially leading to long-term health consequences or liver-related diseases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive.  He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.  Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point.  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.

Swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions: the commune, canton and federal levels. The 1848 federal constitution defines a system of direct democracy (sometimes called half-direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a representative democracy).

Write an article with the title: \\"Obama Laments 'Broken' Politics at Start of Bus Tour\\" Article:","output":"Title: Obama Laments 'Broken' Politics at Start of Bus Tour Introduction: Former President Barack Obama kicked off his nationwide bus tour this week, expressing concern over the current state of politics in the United States. Speaking from the heart, Obama emphasized the importance of unity and restoring a sense of civility amongst Americans. Step 1: Setting the context The bus tour started in the Midwest, a region that holds significant political importance. Highlighting the role of this region is important to establish the backdrop for the rest of the article. Body: The Midwest, often seen as the political heartland of America, is where Obama chose to begin his tour – a strategic choice considering the upcoming midterm elections and the polarized political climate. Cities and towns located in the region are considered to be integral in shaping the political landscape of the United States. Step 2: Elaborating on Obama's views During his speech, Obama shared his candid views on the current state of American politics, openly discussing the issues that plague the system. The former president lamented the broken state of politics, where personal attacks and divisiveness often take precedence over policy discussions. He warned that the country is at a tipping point and expressed disappointment at the lack of unity in addressing the supreme challenges of the nation. Step 3: Describing Obama's proposed solutions Obama used his platform to call for change and suggest ways to mend the political climate. To combat these issues, Obama emphasized the need for open conversation, encouraging Americans to engage with each other respectfully, even when they don't agree on policy. He urged people to seek out and cherish facts, avoid echo chambers, and stay informed about different perspectives. Most importantly, he called for the public to participate actively in the democratic process, particularly by voting in the upcoming elections. Step 4: Discussing the aim of the bus tour The purpose of Obama's bus tour is to support Democratic candidates running for office and promote a sense of unity among all Americans. Obama's main goal during the bus tour is to rally support for and endorse Democratic candidates in the midterm elections, encouraging an increase in Democratic representation in order to help balance the power in Congress. However, he has also expressed his intention to bridge the gap between opposing factions by initiating conversations about the shared dreams and values of all Americans. Conclusion: As the United States faces a deeply divided political climate, Obama's bus tour couldn't have come at a more crucial time. By initiating open conversations and promoting unity, the former president is attempting to instill hope in the hearts of Americans and restore faith in the political system. It remains to be seen whether Obama's efforts will have a tangible impact on the upcoming elections, but his impassioned plea for change is a step in the right direction towards healing the nation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in the town of Idar-Oberstein, West Germany. His father, David Willis, was an American soldier. His mother, Marlene, was German, born in Kassel. Willis is the oldest of four children with a sister named Florence and two brothers, Robert (who is deceased) and David. Context: Throughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as In Country, The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Growing up in a military family, Willis has publicly sold Girl Scout cookies for the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis's then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time.  In 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered 1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war:  I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers--young kids for the most part--helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country.  Willis stated in 2005 that he wanted to \\"make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and democracy.\\" The film would follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in Mosul and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of blogger Michael Yon, a former United States Army Special Forces soldier who was embedded with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their activities. Willis described the plot of the film as \\"these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom.\\" Question: Did he have to pay up?. Whats the answer?","output":"No, Bruce Willis did not pay up. The story about him offering 1 million to anyone who could turn in terrorist leaders was a misunderstanding. He explained in a magazine called Vanity Fair that his words were hypothetical, which means he was just imagining a situation, kind of like when you pretend to be a superhero. He didn't really mean it or plan to give away a million dollars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time  OPTIONS: I. negative. II. positive.","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"be compelling, amusing and unsettling at the same time\\" can be considered as positive.  While analyzing the sentiment of the sentence, let's break down the three adjectives used: 1. Compelling: This suggests that the subject being referred to has a strong and captivating appeal that draws interest and attention. It has a positive sentiment as people generally seek to engage with compelling material, experiences, or personalities. 2. Amusing: As a positive adjective, amusing refers to something that causes laughter, enjoyment, or entertainment. People generally appreciate amusing content or situations for its fun and delightful nature. 3. Unsettling: This adjective carries a slightly negative sentiment, as it implies a situation or content that may provoke unease or create a feeling of discomfort. However, when combined with the other two adjectives, the sentiment of the sentence becomes nuanced and complex. In this context, the unsettling aspect may actually contribute to the overall appeal of the subject as it adds an intriguing, thought-provoking layer. Considering the overall composition of the sentence, the positive sentiments outweigh the slightly negative connotation carried by the term \\"unsettling.\\" Therefore, taking into account the options provided: I. Negative. II. Positive. The sentiment of the sentence can be identified as positive (Option II) as it predominantly points to enthralling, entertaining, and thought-provoking qualities that are generally considered valuable and engaging."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: What were the biggest reasons Hillary Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump, for the presidency? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choose your answer from: (I). no. (II). yes.","output":"(II). yes. Both questions are essentially asking for an analysis of the reasons behind Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 United States Presidential election. To provide a detailed and long answer for this, I will identify and examine various factors that contributed to the outcome. 1. Populist sentiment and the anti-establishment wave: The 2016 election took place during a time when voters in the U.S. and around the world were increasingly expressing dissatisfaction with the political establishment. Trump was able to capitalize on this sentiment by running as a political outsider who promised to \\"drain the swamp\\" in Washington, D.C. In contrast, Clinton, having served as a Senator and Secretary of State, was seen by many as a key member of the establishment. 2. Economic anxiety: Many voters, particularly in the Rust Belt states (such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin), were experiencing economic hardship, with job losses in manufacturing and stagnating wages. Trump's message of reviving jobs and renegotiating trade agreements resonated with these voters, while Clinton's economic platform was perceived as less transformative. 3. Controversies surrounding Hillary Clinton: Throughout the campaign, Clinton was plagued by a series of controversies, including the use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State, her handling of the Benghazi attack, and her paid speeches to Wall Street firms. These issues fueled the perception that she was untrustworthy and reinforced negative preconceptions about her character. 4. Partisanship and political polarization: The 2016 election occurred during a period of increased partisanship and political polarization within the U.S. Many voters on both sides rejected the candidates of the opposing party, and some Republicans who may have been dissatisfied with Trump still voted for him because of their opposition to Clinton. 5. Media coverage and the role of social media: Both Trump and Clinton received widespread media attention, but Trump's controversial statements and tweets often dominated the headlines and conversation, drawing focus away from policy discussions. Additionally, the spreading of fake news and misinformation on social media platforms may have influenced public opinion. 6. The role of third-party candidates: In 2016, third-party candidates like Gary Johnson (Libertarian) and Jill Stein (Green) garnered a higher percentage of votes than in previous elections. This may have siphoned off votes from Clinton, particularly in closely contested states. 7. Voter turnout and apathy: Lower voter turnout among key Democratic demographics, such as young people and minority groups, may have contributed to Clinton's loss. It's possible that the enthusiasm for her candidacy did not match that of Obama in the previous elections, leading some potential supporters to stay home. 8. The impact of the FBI investigation: In the final weeks of the campaign, then-FBI Director James Comey announced the reopening of the investigation into Clinton's email server. This announcement may have negatively impacted her standing in the polls and reinforced doubts about her trustworthiness. In conclusion, the reasons for Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election are multifaceted and include economic anxiety, political polarization, controversies surrounding her candidacy, the impact of third-party candidates, voter turnout and apathy, and outside influences such as the role of the FBI and media coverage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1925, three land-based Hawker fighter aircraft were purchased to be based in Ringsted. A modified version of the Hawker Woodcock, the Hawker DANKOK, was initially delivered from the UK while a following series of 12 aircraft were license-built by the Orlogsværft. In 1928 the naval air service procures six Heinkel HE 8 floatplanes, with another 16 to be license-built by the Orlogsværft. As Germany were not allowed to produce military aircraft, the planes were labelled as mail planes, but they could easily be refitted with dual machine guns, radio equipment and a capacity for eight bombs. The Heinkel had an unexpected arctic employment in the early 1930s when a dispute over East Greenland caused the first deployment of aircraft at Greenland along with three naval ships. Following the settlement of the dispute between Denmark and Norway the Heinkels were used in the efforts to map the frontiers of the island. In 1933, two Hawker Nimrod were acquired to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology of naval aircraft in the interwar period. A further ten planes were to be produced under licence at the Orlogsværft.

March 22 is World Water Day, which has the theme \\"Water and culture \\"this year. There are more than one billion people in the world who live without safe drinking water. The United Nations hopes to cut this number in half by 2015. Solving such a big problem seems like an unreal challenge. But everyone, even teenagers, can do something to help. A teenage girl in the U.S. has set an example to others of her age around the world. Rene Haggerty, 13, was awarded the 2004 Gloria Barron Prize for her work of collecting deserted batteries which pollute water. In 2003, Haggerty went on a field trip to the Great Lakes Science Centre in Ohio. There, she saw an exhibit about how chemicals in old batteries harm the water of Lake Erie. Haggerty learnt that recycling the batteries was an easy solution. \\"I think everybody can do it, because everyone uses batteries, and it can make a big difference.\\" With these words, she began to increase awareness in her area. She talked to her county government and school board. She got permission to start a recycling programmed in schools as well as the public libraries, hospitals, and churches. With the help from her family, friends and local waste-management officials, she gathered containers, arranged transportation, and made an educational video. Over the past two years, she collected four tons of batteries and drew the attention of officials, who were in charge of a battery recycling programmed but had made little progress. When asked if she feels like a hero, Haggerty is quite modest . \\"Not really. Well, maybe for the fish I saved!\\" Every year the Gloria Barron Prize honors young Americans aged 8 to 18 who have shown leadership and courage in serving the public and the planet. Each year ten winners receive 2,000 each, to help with their education costs or their public service work. In order to collect used batteries, Rene Haggerty did the following things EXCEPT    _    . A) gather some containers B) arrange the transportation C) make an educational video D) go on a field trip The answer is:","output":"D) go on a field trip"},{"instruction":"Question: Where is the greatest concentration of KFC in the world I found the following answer on Google: KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) is a fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky , United States, which specializes in fried chicken .

Sunshine duration follows a general geographic pattern: dry areas in the subtropical latitudes (about 25° to 40° north/south) have the highest sunshine values, because these are the locations of the eastern sides of the subtropical high pressure systems, associated with the large-scale descent of air from the upper-level tropopause. Many of the world's driest climates are found adjacent to the eastern sides of the subtropical highs, which create stable atmospheric conditions, little convective overturning, and little moisture and cloud cover. Desert regions, with nearly constant high pressure aloft and rare condensation--like North Africa, the Southwestern United States, Western Australia, and the Middle East--are examples of hot, sunny, dry climates where sunshine duration values are very high.

William wrote the script for their film, while Kevin was the director, because","output":"William was a natural storyteller. He had an uncanny ability to create complex characters, weave together intricate narratives, and construct intense, emotion-driven scenes that captured the essence of the human experience. William spent countless hours brainstorming ideas, finding inspiration from books, movies, paintings, and everyday experiences. He loved to explore diverse genres, ranging from sci-fi and fantasy to drama, comedy, and thriller, showing his versatility as a writer. He brought to the table his unique perspective and imagination that transformed each script into a compelling narrative, able to inspire emotional reactions from the audience. And despite having the ability to tell stories through his scripts, William preferred not to steer the ship. He was more comfortable with his imagination and his trusty typewriter than with cameras, lights, and actors. Conceptualizing the heart of a story and breathing life into it on paper was where his passion was, and he fully understood the need for a different talent to bring his written work to life, visually and audibly. On the other hand, Kevin was a remarkable film director. His vision had a significant influence on the shaping of the film. He could take William's scripts and transform them into cinematic masterpieces. His expertise in framing scenes, coordinating the actors and crew, and managing all the technical aspects of filming were second to none. His keen artistic vision could capture the intangible and make it visually profound.  Moreover, Kevin had a perfect sense of timing and rhythm, essential to the pacing of the film. He understood the emotional depth of the characters and delivered excellent performances from his actors, ones that brilliantly conveyed the intimacies of their fictional lives. The energy and skill he brought to directing produced a directional touch that resonated with audiences.  The symbiotic partnership between William and Kevin was beneficial to the comprehensive creative process. William, with his knack for storytelling, brought life to their ideas on paper. And Kevin, using his skills as a director, transformed these stories into films that fully realized their creative and emotional potential. The distinct but complementary skill sets of William and Kevin created a powerful duo, making their collaborative efforts successful. Their shared passion for storytelling - albeit through different means - allowed them to work together effectively, delivering films that were lauded both for their superb writing and outstanding direction. Overall, the dynamics of this partnership between William the scriptwriter and Kevin the director was because of a shared vision and mutual respect for each other's talents and professions. William would continue to wow with his scripts, writing intricate plots and complex characters, while Kevin, the director, would bring these scripts to stage, turning words into moving, breathing images that compelled audiences. Their collaboration was not merely a division of labor but a holistic creative process where both contributed equally toward the creation of their cinematic masterpieces. They had a unique understanding of the segmentation of their specialties, appreciating each other’s input and acknowledging the significance of the other's contributions to the artistry of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The middle-classes have seen the sharpest increase in numbers of children with nut allergies. Parents who keep their homes obsessively clean could be causing their children to develop life-threatening nut allergies, researchers claim. In the past 20 years the number of British children with the condition has doubled – with the sharpest increase among the middle classes. Scientists say their findings support the theory that youngsters from wealthier families have a  weakened immune system because they live in cleaner homes. Their study examined 8,306 patients, 776 of which had some  form of reaction to peanuts, and  the findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American  College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. Lead study author, allergist Dr Sandy Yip, said: ‘Overall household income is only associated with peanut sensitisation in children aged one to nine years. ‘This may indicate that development of peanut sensitisation at a young age is related to affluence, but those developed later in life are not.’ Researchers also found that peanut allergy was generally higher in males and ethnic minorities. ‘While many children can develop a tolerance to food allergens as they age, only 20 per cent will outgrow a peanut allergy,’ said ACAAI president Dr Stanley Fineman. Nut allergies commonly cause breathing problems and occasionally result in death through anaphylactic shock. Reaction: Researchers also found that peanut allergy was generally higher in males and ethnic minorities. Last year, researchers at Edinburgh and Maastricht universities studied records from more than 400 GP practices in England between 2001 and 2005 to determine the number of patients with an allergy. The study showed more than 25,000 people in England have been diagnosed with a nut allergy at some point in their lives. It also found that children from a more affluent background were twice as likely to have a peanut allergy compared to their poorer counterparts. One British child in 50 has a peanut allergy – double the proportion of two decades ago. The majority of allergic reactions to nuts are mild, with hives, eczema and vomiting the most common complaints. Until 2009, the Food Standards Agency warned women to avoid peanuts in pregnancy and while breastfeeding if there was a family history of allergies. The advice was later altered after a major review of scientific evidence showed there is no clear link between eating peanuts at a young age and developing an allergy in later life. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. The rate of children with nut allergies has doubled in the past 20 years in the UK, with the sharpest increase observed among the middle classes. 2.

One branch of this dynasty, known as the Jagiellons, reigned also in the Kingdom of Poland, Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Bohemia. Several other branches ranked among the leading aristocratic dynasties of Russia and Poland into recent times.  - The Battle of the Vorskla River was a great battle in the medieval history of Eastern Europe. It was fought on August 12, 1399, between the Tatars, under Edigu and Temur Qutlugh, and the armies of Tokhtamysh and Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania. The battle ended in a decisive Tatar victory.  - Maria of Vitebsk (died before 1349) was the first wife of Algirdas, future Grand Duke of Lithuania (marriage took place around 1318). Very little is known about her life. The only child of a Russian prince Yaroslav, Maria was the only heir to the Principality of Vitebsk. After her father's death ca. 1345, Vitebsk fell permanently under control of Algirdas and other Gediminids. Maria gave birth to five sons, all of whom grew up while Algirdas was still only a regional duke in Slavic lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. All five sons were baptized in Orthodox rite and ruled Russian lands giving rise to prominent clans of Russian dukes (Trubetskoy family from Demetrius I Starshy, Czartoryski family from Constantine, Sanguszko family from Fiodor, Belsky and Olelkovich families from Valdimir). After Maria's death, Algirdas married another Russian princess, Uliana of Tver. After Algirdas' death, eldest sons of Maria and Uliana battled over succession rights.  - Tokhtamysh (tat. Tuqtam) or Tokhtamsh (died 1406) was the prominent khan of the Blue Horde, who briefly unified the White Horde and Blue Horde subdivisions of the Golden Horde into a single state. He was a descendant of Genghis Khan's grandson, Tuqa-Timur.  - Andrei of Polotsk ( Belarusian :   , Lithuanian : Andrius Algirdaitis Polish : Andrzej Olgierdowic , ca . 1325 -- 12 August 1399 , in the Battle of the Vorskla River ) was the eldest son of Algirdas , Grand Duke of Lithuania , and his first wife Maria of Vitebsk .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A clicker is a small plastic box with a metal tab in it. When you press it, it makes a clicking sound.  These are available online or in pet stores, and they cost as little as 1. These are commonly used to train dogs and cats.  It's best to use a clicker specifically designed for training. If you don't have one, though, make a distinct clicking noise with your mouth, or you can use a pen that makes a clicking sound. If your cat is deaf, you can use a pen light to achieve the same results. In order for the training to work, you need to give your cat a reward. A common reward is a special treat of some sort (e.g., tuna or deli turkey), and it should be something that can be given instantly to reward behavior. If the treat is food, it should be cut up into pea-sized chunks. Some cats might respond well to affection or a toy. Use a stick-like object, such as a pen or a spoon. This item should be easily recognizable and used only for training. Your cat will eventually follow this object as a target, so you don't want your cat jumping up to the dinner table to follow her training spoon.  You can make a target stick by putting a Ping-Pong ball on the end of a pencil or chopstick.  Don't use the treat as the target. This will teach your cat to do tricks only when there is a treat involved. Eventually you'll want to be able to get your cats to do tricks without treats (though you should still reward with treats sporadically). Set aside about 5 minutes for each training session, and hold these sessions a few times a day. Wait until your cat is active and hungry (it should be at least 20-30 minutes until mealtime). He will be more interested in the treat and will respond better to the training. Start your training in a location that will be quiet and without distractions. If you have other pets around, try putting them outside or in a separate room while you work on training your cat.

The path to noteworthy achievements and discoveries is often paved with challenges, obstacles, and hardships. Yet, despite these difficulties, individuals and societies have continuously strived to make significant strides, resulting in the inspiring progress we witness today. Ancient explorers faced arduous voyages to traverse uncharted territories and seas in the pursuit of knowledge, resources, and trading opportunities. They braved unpredictable weather, limited supplies, and extreme environments with the unwavering belief that they would achieve success. These bold journeys laid the foundation for establishing diverse cultures, histories, and exchanges that shaped our modern world. In more recent times, social and political movements have also experienced tumultuous paths. From the fight for civil rights to the battle for gender equality, brave individuals have taken up to challenge the status quo. They faced substantial resistance and endured significant personal sacrifices, but their perseverance led to transformative changes in societies and the lives of millions of people. Even in the realm of scientific advancements, we can observe the recurrent theme of valiant efforts met with formidable challenges. Researchers and inventors have toiled relentlessly, overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles, to realize groundbreaking discoveries and inventions. From the development of the internet to the race for a COVID-19 vaccine, there are innumerable examples of the monumental achievements of human tenacity and determination. This theme of the difficult journey is not only reflected in influential events of the past but is also mirrored in our personal lives.

OPTIONS: [i] negative; [ii] positive;...I think the answer is","output":"[ii] positive.  To unpack this, it's important to understand the elements of sentiment analysis. This involves determining the attitude or emotion of the writer - here, the person who tweeted - towards something or someone. Looking at the tweet, the first reaction might be to label the sentiment as negative, given the exclamation \\"oh dang\\" and the inquiry \\"what happened?\\", both of which often imply something bad occurred. However, it’s essential to examine the entire context of the message. The second part of the tweet, \\"glad you're alive!\\", significantly changes the overall sentiment. This is an expression of relief and happiness. Despite not knowing the context, this part of the tweet clearly exhibits positive emotions. It conveys gratitude or happiness about the individual's wellbeing.  Regardless of the possibly negative situation alluded to previously, the overt positivity in the latter part of the tweet shifts the overall sentiment to positive. It's more overpowering compared to the initial potential negativity, which is more uncertain and speculative due to its vagueness. Therefore, based on this information, the sentiment of the tweet can be identified as positive. It’s an expression of positivity towards the individual’s state of being alive, showing care, relief, or even joy."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Goal: Prepare a miter saw to cut wood Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"To effectively prepare a miter saw to cut wood, it is essential to follow certain steps and safety guidelines. Though you did not provide any specific methods for comparison, I will outline a comprehensive and reasonable process for preparing a miter saw to cut wood. 1. Safety first: Before you start, ensure you are wearing proper safety gear such as eye protection, hearing protection, and non-slip work gloves. Additionally, ensure your work area is clean, well-lit, and free from any obstructions that may cause accidents. 2. Inspect your miter saw: Look for any signs of damage or wear on the blade, the fence, and the table. Check if the power cord, switch, and other electrical components are in good working condition. If you find any issues, address them before proceeding with the cutting process. 3. Choose the right blade: Based on the type of wood and the desired cut, select the appropriate blade for your miter saw. There are various types of blades available including crosscut, rip, and combination blades. 4. Install the blade: If you need to replace the existing blade, make sure the miter saw is unplugged. Carefully remove the blade guard and then the old blade. Install the new blade by aligning the arbor hole with the arbor on the miter saw, making sure the teeth are facing in the correct direction. Secure the blade by tightening the arbor nut and reinstall the blade guard. 5. Set the cutting angle: Adjust the miter angle to the desired setting for your cut. You can do this by loosening the miter lock handle, rotating the table or saw head to the appropriate angle and then retightening the miter lock handle. Some miter saws have positive stops or detents at common angles to make this process easier. 6. Adjust the bevel angle (if necessary): If you need to make a compound miter cut, adjust the bevel angle as well. Loosen the bevel lock handle, tilt the saw head left or right to the desired angle, and tighten the bevel lock handle again. 7. Secure the workpiece: Place the wood on the miter saw table, holding it firmly against the fence. Use clamps or a miter saw stand with adjustable workpiece stops to hold the wood securely in place. Make sure that no part of your hands are in the path of the blade. 8. Check the positioning: Perform a \\"dry run\\" by slowly lowering the saw blade to ensure it lines up with your intended cutting line on the wood and there are no obstructions before making the cut. 9. Power up the miter saw: Plug in the miter saw, turn on the power switch, and allow the blade to reach full speed. 10. Make the cut: With the blade at full speed, carefully lower it into the wood and follow through across the workpiece with a slow and steady motion. Once the cut is complete, release the trigger, let the blade come to a complete stop, and raise the saw head back up. By following these steps, you can safely and effectively prepare a miter saw to cut wood. It is important to maintain control, work with proper safety measures, and use the right equipment for the task at hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In a emotional 15th birthday message to her daughter Abigail, Zenya Hernandez begged for the schoolgirl to come home. The last call made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was last Wednesday about four hours after she was last seen, investigators said on Sunday. Abigail Hernandez, 15, of North Conway was last seen leaving Kennett High School on Wednesday afternoon. Police say she made it home but was gone when her mother arrived later. Police said they have not located the girl’s phone but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm. It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain, a ski resort popular with tourists. Several agencies, including the FBI, have been involved in searching for the girl by land, water and air. The mother of the missing 15-year-old pleaded for her daughter's safe return on Sunday, saying: 'Please come home. We miss you so badly.' Speaking in front of Conway police station on Sunday, Zenya Hernandez wished her daughter Abigail a happy birthday. Kieran Ramsey, from the FBI, confirmed today that teams are continuing their searches using five sniffer dog teams. Officers are also canvassing and chasing up tip-offs from the public, though no new information has come to light. Abigail, a Kennett High School student, has been missing since Wednesday last week after walking home from class. The last sighting of the girl, who ran on. the track team for her school and was described as quiet and bright,. was around 2.30pm. Investigators believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back from her nursing job, her daughter was gone. The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on Saturday. Since then local police and the FBI have searched on foot, in boats, and by helicopter but have failed to turn up any new evidence about the disappearance. Zenya Hernandez held a press conference on Sunday at the Conway police station in New Hampshire where she pleaded for her daughter's safe return. FBI fixed-wing planes have been. drafted into the search, and on Saturday lines of officials meticulously. searched four square miles of woodland. Despite. searching over 3,000 acres Major Kevin Jordan of the Maine Fish and. Game Department, said: 'We are nowhere near done. We are here to find. Abi and to bring her home.' Five specially trained teams of sniffer dogs were also used, but so far to no avail. The search has been so thorough that officers have found the body of a hiker who went missing over the weekend, and bone fragments from another case, possibly that of a hiker who went missing in 2006. Both sets of evidence are unrelated to the Hernandez case. New Hampshire's White Mountains are full of tourists at this time of year as they come to take pictures of the leaves changing in autumn. Police, FBI, New Hampshire Fish and Game personnel and volunteers have all helped to search for the teenager but have not found any leads. Sniffer dog teams, police helicopters, and FBI fixed-wing planes have been drafted in as police reveal they have been sent 200 leads from as far away as Texas. This weekend the holidaymakers were handed flyers of the pretty girl and told to watch for anything suspicious. Hernandez's picture was also plastered over store windows in North Conway Village and in the popular shopping mall. Police officials said they are still treating Hernandez's disappearance as a missing persons case, but added that foul play has not been ruled out. So far officers say they have received over 200 tip-offs, some from as far away as Texas. Abigail is 5ft 4in tall and weighs 118lb with. brown hair and eyes.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kenneth Elton Kesey (; September 17, 1935 - November 10, 2001) as Ken Kesey was an American novelist, essayist, and countercultural figure. He considered himself a link between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s. While still enrolled at the University of Oregon in 1957, Kesey wrote End of Autumn; according to Rick Dogson, the novel \\"focused on the exploitation of college athletes by telling the tale of a football lineman who was having second thoughts about the game.\\" Although Kesey came to regard the unpublished work as juvenilia, an excerpt served as his Stanford Creative Writing Center application sample.  During his Woodrow Wilson Fellowship year, Kesey wrote Zoo, a novel about the beatniks living in the North Beach community of San Francisco, but it was never published.  The inspiration for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest came while working on the night shift with Gordon Lish at the Menlo Park Veterans' Hospital. There, Kesey often spent time talking to the patients, sometimes under the influence of the hallucinogenic drugs with which he had volunteered to experiment. Kesey did not believe that these patients were insane, but rather that society had pushed them out because they did not fit the conventional ideas of how people were supposed to act and behave. Published under the guidance of Cowley in 1962, the novel was an immediate success; in 1963, it was adapted into a successful stage play by Dale Wasserman, and in 1975, Milos Forman directed a screen adaptation, which won the \\"Big Five\\" Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Director (Forman) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman).  Kesey originally was involved in creating the film, but left two weeks into production. He claimed never to have seen the movie because of a dispute over the 20,000 he was initially paid for the film rights. Kesey loathed the fact that, unlike the book, the film was not narrated by the Chief Bromden character, and he disagreed with Jack Nicholson's being cast as Randle McMurphy (he wanted Gene Hackman). Despite this, Faye Kesey has stated that her husband was generally supportive of the film and pleased that it was made. what was the novel about?","output":"The novel \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" was about Kesey's experiences while working on the night shift with Gordon Lish at the Menlo Park Veterans' Hospital.

Chinese state-owned construction firm signs £2.5bn deal to build modular homes with UK housing association A UK housing association has signed a landmark £2.5bn joint venture with a Chinese state-owned construction company to build 25,000 modular homes over the next five years. Your Housing Group, which currently manages 33,000 affordable homes across the North West, Yorkshire and the Midlands, has agreed to partner with China National Building Material Company (CNBM) to build the homes, alongside WeLink, a renewable energy company. As part of the deal, which has the support of the Government, CNBM will build six factories in the UK, creating 1,000 new jobs. Government statistics suggest that the UK needs a million new homes by 2020, but last year just 142,890 homes were built, below the 200,000-a-year target. Modular homes can be constructed off-site and then transported to their final location, resulting in a quicker and cheaper building process. At the moment, around 15,000 homes are constructed this way in the UK each year. If the initial stage of production is successful, the new factories could produce 25,000 homes each year, the company said. The first scheme, in Liverpool, is expected to receive planning permission in January. Ajmal Rahman, chairman of Welink Group, said that “radical innovation” in building practices and modular housing would help to address the housing shortfall. “This joint venture will give a significant kick-start to delivering the new homes people need across the UK, which includes helping to address fuel poverty issues through our incorporated solar and energy efficient design,” he added. Brian Cronin, chief executive Your Housing Group, said: “This is an opportunity for YHG to get back to building more social and affordable homes across a wider geography of the UK, it also ensures new types of employment, new building skills, and the nurturing of additional apprenticeship opportunities are available, which can only be good news for local people and businesses where we develop our housing and supply chains.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"A UK housing association, Your Housing Group, has made a deal with a Chinese construction company, CNBM, to build 25,000 homes that are called \\"modular homes.\\" These modular homes can be built in one place and then moved to another place where people want to live. Modular homes are faster and cheaper to build than regular homes. This is good because many people in the UK need new homes. The Chinese company will also create six new factories in the UK, which will give jobs to 1,000 people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Understand the hypothesis - The hypothesis states that under the Alternative Estimates, the cost of respiratory illnesses is tallied. Step 3: Analyze the logical relationship - The premise is concerned with the number of avoided cases of various respiratory problems under the Alternative Estimate in comparison to the Base. This provides information on the occurrence of respiratory illnesses and how they have been potentially reduced. - The hypothesis, on the other hand, deals with the cost of respiratory illnesses under the Alternative Estimates. This refers to the monetary aspect of dealing with these respiratory issues.

It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

What is the answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who was only fourteen when wed? from the following article ?  At the court in Ferrara, a collection of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to the court in 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers. The Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by Alfonso in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court. According to Grana, a contemporary correspondent, \\"Signora Machiavella [Lucrezia], Signora Isabella, and Signora Vittoria have abandoned the field, having lost the backing of Luzzaschi\\". The first recorded performance by the professional ladies was on November 20, 1580; by carnival season in 1581, they were performing together regularly.This new \\"consort of ladies\\" was viewed as an extraordinary and novel phenomenon; most witnesses did not connect the second period of the concerto delle donne with the group of ladies who sang in...

Help as much as you can. Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. Question: Why does the author try Naked shampoos? Options:  A. Natural shampoos do not irritate his/her scalp  B. not enough information  C. Shampoos that have chemicals are bad  D. They're aimed at damaged hair  === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"A. Natural shampoos do not irritate his/her scalp"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

There are no trees nearby to make a simple bridge for us. We will need something called a \\"bridge\\". A bridge is like a long, flat path that goes over the river so we can walk, ride a bike, or even drive a car over it. It helps us get to the other side of the river safely without getting wet! Now, making a bridge isn't just about putting some wood or metal over the river. We have to be smart about it. That's where the \\"logic\\" part comes in. Logic means thinking carefully and making good decisions, so the bridge is strong and safe for everyone. To build a good bridge, we need to think about: 1. What materials are strong enough to hold us up? We can use wood, metal, or even special concrete that's really strong. 2. How to make sure the bridge doesn't fall down? We can use triangles or arches when we design the bridge. They help distribute the weight (you know, like when mommy, daddy, and the dog stand on the bridge) so the bridge stays strong and safe. 3. How long and wide the bridge should be? It's important to make sure the bridge is the right size, not too short, or too long. This will help everyone cross the river easily. So now you know a little bit about bridge logic! It's all about thinking carefully and making smart choices when we build our bridges across the water.

Article: Tigers are among the most admired and most feared animals in the world . When we think of a tiger, we think of danger. We think of the big teeth and large feet of it. We also think of beauty. The tiger is a hunter that hunts alone. In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal  at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger. When they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people. What tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female  tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously. It isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger. Tigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals. That is one reason why tigers hunt alone. If they lived in big groups, they could never find enough animals to feed them all. Question: According to the passage, why do tigers hunt alone? - They can run faster hunting alone. - They can't get along well with other tigers. - They can hide themselves easily in this way. - They can't find enough animals to share with other tigers.

Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the given data about the car The user asks two things: what was the first Honda car, and if a specific statement about the weight of a convertible is reasonable.  Step 2: Research the first Honda car To answer the first part of the question, I need to find out what the first Honda car was. After conducting research, I found that the first Honda car was the Honda T360, a mini pick-up truck, introduced in August 1963, closely followed by the S500, a sports car, in October 1963. Step 3: Analyze the given statement Now I will analyze the statement: \\"With the convertible weighing in at mere, the extra sheet metal of the coupe only added to the overall weight.\\" This statement talks about the weight of a convertible and the weight of a coupe version of the same car. It implies that the convertible version is lighter than the coupe version. Step 4: Determine if the statement is applicable to the question Since the question is specifically about the first Honda car, which was the Honda T360, not a convertible or coupe, the given statement is not applicable to the first Honda car.

No The sentence \\"The citizens of Saint Helena hold British Overseas Territories citizenship.\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What act restored the full British citizenship of the citizens of Saint Helena?\\" The sentence only states the fact that the citizens of Saint Helena have British Overseas Territories citizenship. It does not address the specific act that restored the full British citizenship of these citizens. The British Nationality Act 1981 created a new category of citizenship called British Dependent Territories Citizenship (BDTC), which applied to those living in British Overseas Territories, including Saint Helena. As a result, these individuals were no longer considered full British citizens, which limited their rights, specifically the right to live and work in the United Kingdom. Growing concerns about the disadvantages faced by the British Overseas Territories citizens led to the British government taking action to restore their full British citizenship. The British Overseas Territories Act 2002 played a significant role in amending the British Nationality Act 1981 and addressing these concerns. This act granted British citizenship to all the citizens in the British Overseas Territories, including Saint Helena citizens.

OLD TOWN - the heart and soul of Key West and the place most visitors spend their time - is only one mile by two. The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man. They hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers.

The green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition.  - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year.

Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking.

The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to...  I am facing a new situation today: David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would trail B be shorter or longer than trail A? Answer:","output":"Considering the information from the background article, it can be inferred that trail B would most likely be longer than trail A. This is because ants tend to reinforce and follow the shorter and more efficient routes to food sources, as they mark and follow pheromone trails. Since trail A was followed by many ants and trail B was abandoned, it suggests that trail A was the shorter and more efficient route, while trail B was longer or less efficient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: Southampton has always been a port, and the docks have long been a major employer in the city. In particular, it is a port for cruise ships; its heyday was the first half of the 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK. Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth largest UK port by tonnage, with several container terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as Liverpool, London, and Bristol, where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry.

Here is a question about this article: Beginning as a self-help program in the mid-1960s, the Cotton Research and Promotion Program (CRPP) was organized by U.S. cotton producers in response to cotton's steady decline in market share. At that time, producers voted to set up a per-bale assessment system to fund the program, with built-in safeguards to protect their investments. With the passage of the Cotton Research and Promotion Act of 1966, the program joined forces and began battling synthetic competitors and re-establishing markets for cotton. Today, the success of this program has made cotton the best-selling fiber in the U.S. and one of the best-selling fibers in the world.[citation needed] What is the answer to this question: What prompted a help program produced by cotton producers in the 1960s?","output":"The prompt for the creation of a self-help program by cotton producers in the 1960s was the steady decline in market share of cotton due to competition from synthetic materials.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the process would be: The adult butterfly reproduces, laying eggs to start the life cycle again. Here's the step-by-step reasoning behind the conclusion: 1. A butterfly starts as an egg: This step establishes the beginning of the butterfly life cycle. 2. The egg hatches: In this step, the egg opens, and the next stage of the life cycle is introduced. 3. A larva emerges: The larva, also known as a caterpillar, comes out of the egg and starts its growth process. 4. The larva eats and grows: To grow, the larva consumes food (mainly plant material) and increases in size. 5. The larva sheds its skin: As the larva grows, it sheds its skin several times, allowing for more growth and development. 6. The larva enters a chrysalis: When it has reached a certain size, the larva forms a protective casing called a chrysalis. 7. The pupa grows inside the chrysalis: Inside the chrysalis, the larva undergoes metamorphosis and turns into a pupa. 8. The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis: Once the metamorphosis is complete, the adult butterfly emerges from the chrysalis. 9. The adult butterfly is now fully grown: At this stage, the butterfly has reached its mature form. Considering the life cycle of a butterfly (and most animals) includes reproduction to create offspring, the next natural step after the adult butterfly is fully grown would be: 10.

The primary focus is on using these heavy rocks and stones to weigh down and secure the liner, making it a crucial element in constructing a stable and visually appealing garden stream.  Garden rocks and stones serve as a natural and eye-catching feature, enhancing the aesthetic value of any garden area. They add a touch of texture and contrast to the landscape, while also creating an appealing focal point. Incorporating these rocks and stones into a garden stream design allows for a harmonious integration of the various elements, resulting in a balanced and visually appealing arrangement. One of the significant functions of these rocks and stones in a garden stream is their ability to weigh down the liner. Liners are essential for maintaining the water flow and preventing any possible leaks that might arise from the soil. Garden rocks and stones, being heavy and robust, effectively keep the liner in place, ensuring the stability of the overall structure. Furthermore, their weight prevents the liner from floating or shifting due to water pressure or other external factors. Using heavy rocks and stones not only provides a practical solution to this issue but also adds to the natural beauty and character of the garden stream. These rocks and stones can be strategically arranged in various shapes, sizes, and colors, to complement the surrounding landscape. Their influence on the appearance of the stream can transform it from a simple water feature into an artistically curated and captivating element in the garden. In conclusion, incorporating garden rocks and stones into a garden stream design offers several advantages, including enhancing the visual appearance, providing support and stability to the liner, and creating a harmonious balance between the various landscape elements. Utilizing heavy rocks and stones should not be a cause for concern; instead, they should be embraced as an important and valuable aspect of constructing and designing a beautiful, functional garden stream."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who kicked the third longest field goal?","output":"Title: A Look at the Record Books: The Third Longest Field Goal in NFL History Introduction Field goals are essential scoring aspects in American Football – the longer the goal, the more intriguing it becomes. Fans and experts often debate the accuracy and difficulty required to achieve such astonishing feats that are etched in NFL history. However, it's undeniable that kicking record-breaking field goals goes beyond simply conquering challenging situations; it often involves overcoming emotions and intense pressure brought upon by the weight of the game. In this article, we take a closer look at the third longest field goal ever scored in the NFL and the talented player behind it. The Third Longest Field Goal: Sebastian Janikowski On September 12, 2011, Sebastian Janikowski of the Oakland Raiders etched his name in the record books when he successfully scored a 63-yard field goal against the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High stadium, Denver. Kicking the field goal in the mile-high thin air of the stadium, Janikowski tied with two other legends, Tom Dempsey and Jason Elam, as the third longest field goal holder in the NFL. Sebastian Janikowski's Career Born on March 2, 1978, in Poland, Sebastian Janikowski is a former American football placekicker who spent the majority of his career playing with the Oakland Raiders. With a storied career spanning 19 years, Janikowski, also nicknamed \\"Seabass,\\" was known for his consistency, accuracy, and aptitude in attempting and converting long field goals. Janikowski's journey to the NFL began when he was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the first round of the 2000 NFL Draft out of Florida State University. His selection was initially met with mixed reactions, as it was unusual for a placekicker to be picked so early in the draft. However, he soon proved his worth in the league, developing into one of the most dependable and lethal kickers in NFL history. Throughout his career, Janikowski made 436 of his 542 field goal attempts, with a field goal percentage of 80.4% and 605 out of the 614 extra point attempts, amassing a total of 1,913 points. While most remembered for his 63-yard field goal against the Denver Broncos, Janikowski also has an impressive collection of 50+ yard field goals. Third Longest Field Goal Record Holders: Dempsey, Elam, and Prater While Sebastian Janikowski managed to make an astounding 63-yard field goal, it is essential to acknowledge those who share the honor of achieving this impressive feat. Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints was the first player to set the record in 1970, which was later matched by Jason Elam of the Denver Broncos in 1998. Each of them held the record for the third longest field goal until Matt Prater finally broke it in December 2013 with a 64-yard field goal for the Denver Broncos. Conclusion Sebastian Janikowski's legendary 63-yard field goal remains one of the most memorable and iconic events in NFL history. His exceptional career is a testament to his talent and consistency, which resulted in his being one of the most reliable kickers in the league. Janikowski's determination and skill manifest the essence of a true athlete, and his story will inspire generations of aspiring football players to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Arcadia is set in a classic Italian-inspired dining room and serves lavish dishes such as terrine of pheasant marinated in cognac, grilled lamb glazed with mint and garlic, and duck confit on thin strudel pastry with red cabbage. El Fogon is more popular with the late-night diners of the city. Its interior is brightly lit and the walls covered with big mirrors. Officially a barbecue and seafood restaurant, it serves grilled meat dishes, as well as salmon, shrimp and calamari. Also of note is the Cru. Numerous restaurants are located along the Rambla of Montevideo. There is an Irish pub in the eastern part of the Old District named Shannon Irish pub, another testament to the European heritage of the city.

The Titans pulled off an important divisional win behind the strong running of rookie RB Chris Johnson, who rushed for 93 yards in his NFL debut, and the arm of backup quarterback Kerry Collins, who replaced starter Vince Young when he went down late in the 4th quarter. Young had been inconsistent, throwing 1 TD pass to Johnson and 2 INTs. However, Collins moved the ball down field effectively and that drive led to the eventual game-winning touchdown run by LenDale White. Jacksonville trailed for much of the game and couldn't run the ball against a locked in Titans defense, who sacked Jaguars quarterback David Garrard 7 times. Both teams' defenses played well but the Titans held on. This game was also significant because the Jaguars, Texans, and Colts (in their debut at Lucas Oil Stadium) lost, so the Titans grabbed first place in the AFC South for the first week of the season, ending a 56-week streak of holding 1st place in the division by the Colts as the team started the season 1-0. How many NFL games did Chris Johnson play before this one?","output":"This was Chris Johnson's NFL debut, so he hadn't played any NFL games before this one."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Elway and his twin sister were born in Port Angeles, Washington, to Janet (nee Jordan) and Jack Elway, then the head coach at Port Angeles High School on the Olympic Peninsula. The family of five included sister Lee Ann, a year older than the twins. They moved the following year to southwestern Washington, where Jack was the junior college head football coach at Grays Harbor Community College in Aberdeen for five seasons. As a youth, Elway lived primarily in Missoula, Montana, and Pullman, Washington, when his father was an assistant coach at Montana and Washington State, respectively. In the 1983 NFL Draft, Elway was selected as the first overall pick by the Baltimore Colts. Elway was wary of playing for the Colts, among the worst teams in the league at the time, and his father advised him against playing for head coach Frank Kush, who had a reputation as a harsh taskmaster. While Elway preferred football, his agent Marvin Demoff later stated that baseball was \\"a true option\\" for him at the time. The possibility gave Elway leverage in negotiations with the Colts.  After unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a private agreement with the Colts in which Elway would cite his alleged desire to remain on the West coast to explain the team trading him, Elway publicly threatened to join the Yankees full-time if the Colts did not trade him; Demoff wrote in his journal, published three decades later, that \\"he would be a garbage collector before he'd play for Baltimore.\\" Elway's refusal to join the Colts was controversial-- Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw denounced him, stating \\"you should play baseball ... he's not the kind of guy you win championships with\\"--but many other NFL teams began negotiations with the Colts for the quarterback. One possibility was trading Elway for the San Francisco 49ers' Joe Montana, whose team had had a poor season in 1982. Another was a trade with the San Diego Chargers, which was negotiating a new contract with its star quarterback Dan Fouts. The New England Patriots were interested, but the Colts did not wish to trade Elway to a team in the same division.  The Colts' general manager Ernie Accorsi wanted Elway as, Accorsi later said, he did not foresee the 1984 Draft as producing any first-round quarterbacks. Accorsi announced Elway as the team's choice as soon as possible during the 15-minute window on draft day, surprising observers. Elway that day reiterated his wish to not play for the Colts at a press conference, saying \\"As I stand here right now, I'm playing baseball\\". (When a reporter pointed out that the Yankees were not based on the West coast, Elway replied \\"They play baseball during the summertime\\".) The Colts, however, were interested in offensive lineman Chris Hinton, who the Denver Broncos had chosen as the fourth pick in the first round. On May 2, Colts owner Robert Irsay and Accorsi agreed to trade Elway for Hinton, backup quarterback Mark Herrmann, and a first-round pick in the 1984 Draft. The Colts controversial relocation to Indianapolis the following year would later prove to somewhat vindicate Jack Elway's concerns, and that franchise would largely struggle until the arrival of Peyton Manning during Elway's last season as a player. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he end up playing for the Colts?","output":"No, he did not end up playing for the Colts. He was traded to the Denver Broncos in exchange for Chris Hinton, backup quarterback Mark Herrmann, and a first-round pick in the 1984 Draft."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was the founder and first leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party, which believed the Great Depression was caused by ordinary people not having enough to spend. Therefore, Aberhart argued that the government should give each Albertan 25 per month to spend to stimulate the economy, by providing needed purchasing power to allow needy customers to buy from waiting businesses.  - Major Clifford Hugh \\"C. H.\\" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879  29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement.  - Rachel Anne Notley (born April 17, 1964) is a Canadian politician and the 17th and current Premier of Alberta, since 2015. She is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for Edmonton-Strathcona, and leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party. The daughter of former Alberta NDP leader Grant Notley, Notley's career before politics focused on labour law, with a specialty in workers' compensation advocacy and workplace health and safety issues.  - Social credit is an interdisciplinary distributive philosophy developed by C. H. Douglas (18791952), a British engineer, who published a book by that name in 1924. It encompasses economics, political science, history, and accounting. Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals. Douglas wrote, \\"Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is self-development, is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic.\\" Douglas said that Social Crediters want to build a new civilization based upon \\"absolute economic security\\" for the individual, where \\"they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.\\" In his words, \\"what we really demand of existence is not that we shall be put into somebody else's Utopia, but we shall be put in a position to construct a Utopia of our own.\\"  - The Alberta Social Credit Party is a provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, that was founded on social credit monetary policy put forward by Clifford Hugh Douglas and on conservative Christian social values. The Canadian social credit movement was largely an out-growth of the Alberta Social Credit Party. The Social Credit Party of Canada was strongest in Alberta, before developing a base in Quebec when Réal Caouette agreed to merge his Ralliement créditiste movement into the federal party. The British Columbia Social Credit Party formed the government for many years in neighbouring British Columbia, although this was effectively a coalition of centre-right forces in the province that had no interest in social credit monetary policies.  - The Bow River is a river in the Canadian province of Alberta.

Movie title: The Great Ziegfeld Movie plot: Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. was born to an upper-middle class family in the late 19th century. From his father he inherited taste in classical music, and his mother taste in fashion and genteel manners. Dr. Ziegfeld had hoped that his son will takeover the family music reservoir, but after the success of his show in the 1893 World Fair, Flo Ziegfeld was determined to become a showman.Learning from his mistakes in the World Fair, Flo combined attraction with sex appeal and took Sandow the Strong Man on a successful nation-wide tour. After he and Sandow parted ways, Flo was on his way to Europe in search of new talent. He ran into best friend Billings during the crossing.Billings and Flo were both show producers and extremely competitive with each other. Sensing that Billings was in London to sign up a mysterious new talent, the conniving Flo found out who the girl was and put his womanising tricks to their best use. He convinced French singing sensation Anna Held to sign with him instead even though he was down to his last 50 cents.Always living lavishly on borrowed money, Flo managed to built some connections and got enough money to put on the show, but other than commenting on Anna's exceptional beauty, her singing received little attention from the American audience, especially the women. A master publist, Flo had 20 gallons of milk sent to Anna's apartment everyday and purposedly refused to pay the bill. The creditor sued him and Anna's alleged beauty secret - her milk baths - made headlines. Anna Held became household synonyms for what's beautiful and fashionable, Flo's accountant stopped seeing red in the books.By 1907, Flo and Anna had been married for some time and Flo found it boring to feature only one girl in a show. He wanted to produce a show featuring girls, lots of girls; and the stage would be so big that even the audience in the last row would be able to see the performance. Flo sold the idea to Billings, Billings sold it to famous producer Erlanger; and so began 24 years of the Zigfeld Follies.Flo's... Answer:","output":"Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. enjoyed classical music, as he inherited the taste for it from his father. This is evident from the movie plot where it is stated that Ziegfeld's father was a classical music enthusiast and passed it down to his son. As a result, Flo Ziegfeld developed an appreciation for classical music and incorporated it into various aspects of his life, including his career as a showman. In the movie \\"The Great Ziegfeld,\\" this appreciation for classical music can be seen throughout multiple scenes, both in terms of scores and the performances within the story. The film is a musical biopic and showcases a variety of musical styles, including classical, popular, and traditional theatrical songs. These are used to represent different aspects of Ziegfeld's life, such as his upbringing, his various relationships, and his career as a theater producer. However, it is important to note that Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. was not only known for his love of classical music. As a showman, he developed a keen sense of what the audience wanted and had an uncanny ability to adapt to popular culture. He explored various musical genres, such as jazz and ragtime, to keep his shows fresh and interesting. This adaptability allowed him to remain relevant during a time of significant societal change and cultural evolution. The movie itself showcases this adaptability by including songs that span a range of musical genres and eras, from classical to jazz and Broadway. By doing so, it highlights the breadth of Ziegfeld's achievements and his impact on the entertainment industry, particularly his ability to synthesize different genres into a cohesive and entertaining show. In conclusion, Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. enjoyed classical music, though he also had an appreciation for a wide variety of other musical genres. This understanding and love for diverse music styles greatly influenced his career and allowed him to become a highly successful showman. In \\"The Great Ziegfeld,\\" classical music serves as a significant aspect of the movie's soundtrack and plot, reflecting the essential role that music played in Ziegfeld's life and work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: When you're just starting out training with weights, it's important to lift as much as you can right away.","output":"No, the hypothesis drawn from the given context is incorrect. The proposed hypothesis states that when starting out with weight training, it's crucial to lift as much weight as possible right away. However, this idea contradicts the context provided, which emphasizes gradual strength building and choosing an appropriate weight. The proper hypothesis that can be drawn from the context would be: When starting out with weight training, it's important to choose an appropriate weight that allows for gradual strength building, rather than attempting to lift as much as possible right away. This hypothesis aligns with the context's emphasis on gradual progression and appropriate weight selection, as it highlights the importance of not overburdening yourself when commencing a new exercise routine. Instead, the focus should be on choosing a suitable weight that will enable consistent progress over time. Overexerting yourself by trying to lift too much weight at the beginning can result in injuries, muscle imbalances, and an increased risk of burnout. It's essential to start with a manageable weight for your fitness level, which will enable you to work on technique and develop a strong foundation. Gradual strength building involves prioritizing proper form and learning the correct movements to prevent any possible injuries. As you consistently work with an appropriate weight, you'll begin to notice improvements in strength, allowing you to increase the weight gradually as your body adapts. In summary, a more accurate hypothesis based on the context would be that choosing an appropriate weight and building strength gradually is vital when starting weight training, rather than attempting to lift as much as possible right away. This approach is crucial for ensuring long-term success, reducing the risk of injuries, and promoting proper technique."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, you know that getting on stage is not easy for him. He got polio as a child, and has to walk with the aid of two crutches now. That night Perlman walked slowly to his chair. Then he sat down and began to play. But, suddenly, one of the strings on his violin broke. You could hear it break---it broke with a loud noise. People thought to themselves, \\"He would have to get up to either find another violin or find another string for this one.\\" But he didn't. Instead, he waited a moment, closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again. The orchestra began, and he played from where he had stopped. He played with such passion and such power. Of course, everyone knows that it is impossible to play a symphonic work with just three strings. But that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that. You could see him changing and recomposing the piece in his head. When he finished, there was a silence in the room. Then people rose and cheered. We were all on our feet, doing everything we could to show how much we appreciated what he had done.

This date was adopted at the first convention of the IFB, held in Colombo on October 4, 1969. The object of _ is to enable the general public to have a better understanding of blindness and visual handicap, and to make people more aware of the white cane as a mobility aid. Peguilly d'Herbemont was born on 25th June 1888 into an old French noble family of the same name. In her youth she led the conventional and protected existence, lack of great activity, of a girl from a \\"good family\\", an existence reminding of the life of the aristocracy  before the French Revolution. She never visited a public school, but was educated by German and English governesses and nuns. Her movements were restricted and were mainly confined to the family positions in Paris and Belgium, but she spent most of her time at the castle of Charmois not far from Verdun. In the process of helping individual blind people across the road, Peguilly d'Herbemont was made aware by narrow scrapes  which almost led to accidents, of the dangerous situation of the visually impaired brought about by the steadily increasing traffic on the roads. She first spoke about measures to protect the blind against street hazards to her mother in 1930, but she was of the opinion that it was unfit for a lady of good society to create a public outcry and advised her to stick to the transcription of books, a popular pastime of ladies of rank at the time. But the idea did not leave her. The urgent wish to encourage the integration  of the blind into society by providing them with a means of moving about more freely without endangering others, and at the same time attracting the attention of passers-by ready to offer assistance, caused her to take the unusual step of writing to the editor of the Paris daily Echo de Paris in which she suggested issuing the blind of the Paris region with white sticks similar to...

HOUSTON -- Texans coach Gary Kubiak collapsed as he was leaving the field at halftime of Houston's Sunday night game against the Indianapolis Colts.      Kubiak was taken to a local hospital in an ambulance with his family and was conscious, according to the Texans. The team said Kubiak did not have a heart attack and was in stable condition.

They still have not made a final determination. They believe dehydration could be a part of it, but they also are testing for more significant reasons, the source said.      The 52-year-old Kubiak fell to his knees and grimaced when he collapsed, but he never lost consciousness.      \\"It was really weird,\\" Texans quarterback Case Keenum said. \\"Someone came in [to the locker room] and started yelling for a trainer. They said that he had passed out and we were all very worried.\\" ||||| As the Houston Texans trickled into the locker room at halftime and learned that coach Gary Kubiak had collapsed leaving the field, their excitement over a big first half quickly disintegrated into dread.

He was lifted off the field on a stretcher and taken by cart to the ambulance.      \\"We were all very worried,\\" quarterback Case Keenum said. \\"When we went back out they told us he was ... stable. We were all upset about that but trying to stay focused at the same time.\\"      The Texans didn't say what was wrong with Kubiak, but did say he didn't have a heart attack. The team said the 52-year-old coach, a former NFL quarterback who calls the team's plays, was conscious and was with his family as he was taken to the hospital.      \\"He had an episode; he was light-headed and dizzy,\\" Houston general manager Rick Smith said in an interview on NBC. \\"He was evaluated by a number of specialists ... he is awake and coherent.      We have to assess ... obviously, there's a lot of info. Hopefully, Gary will be back with us tomorrow.\\"      Up 21-3 when Kubiak collapsed, the Texans struggled after halftime for their sixth straight loss after opening the season 2-0 with Super Bowl hopes.      Veteran safety Ed Reed didn't want to blame the loss what happened to Kubiak.      \\"I thought we dealt with it well,\\" Reed said. \\"We've just got to finish.\\"      Kubiak's collapse came a day after Denver Broncos coach John Fox was hospitalized in North Carolina as he awaits aortic value replacement surgery. The 58-year-old Fox will have surgery in a few days and will miss several weeks while recuperating.      Fox had been told earlier about his heart condition and was hoping to put off the operation until February. As part of his trip to North Carolina on a bye week, he met with his cardiologist in Raleigh and was told to seek medical attention immediately if he felt any discomfort.      On Saturday, Fox became dizzy playing golf near his offseason home in Charlotte and was taken to a hospital, where tests revealed he couldn't wait any longer to have the surgery.      In college, Minnesota coach Jerry Kill took a leave of absence last month so he could better manage and treat his epilepsy. He has had five seizures on game day in his two-plus seasons with the Golden Gophers.      Kubiak has long been known as a top offensive coach, mentoring quarterbacks in Denver under Mike Shanahan and now Matt Schaub _ and Case Keenum _ in Houston. Kubiak has had no known public health problems.      Kubiak was hired in 2006, along with general manager Rick Smith, after the Texans finished a franchise-worst 2-14. Smith spent 10 years with Kubiak while the coach was offensive coordinator of the Broncos. Smith was Denver's defensive assistant for four seasons before moving into the front office for his last six years with the Broncos.      The pair has helped transform the Texans, which began play in 2002, from league laughingstock to contender. The team went 6-10 in their first year and 8-8 in each of the next two seasons. Expectations were high in 2010 after Houston finished at 9-7 for its first winning record in 2009. But the Texans instead fell to 6-10, which led to many fans calling for Kubiak's firing.      His original contract was due to expire after the 2010 season, but owner Bob McNair has stepped up to keep Kubiak and defended him several times amid the bumps. Among recent departures were assistant head coach Alex Gibbs (for Seattle) and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan went to join his father, Mike, in Washington.      Last year, the Texans announced contract extensions for both Smith and Kubiak, rewarding them for taking the team to the playoffs last year for the first time. Kubiak's three-year agreement has him under contract through 2014.      McNair said at the time he offered Kubiak a four-year deal, but the coach preferred to make it for three.      Kubiak made his mark as Denver's offensive coordinator under Mike Shanahan, winning two Super Bowls. An eighth-round pick out of Texas A&M, he spent nine years as John Elway's backup. He finished his career 4-1 as a starter, all in emergency relief of Elway.      ___      AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Houston Texans' head coach, Gary Kubiak, collapsed on the field in a 2013 game against the Indianapolis Colts.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions:  - Connie Chan Po - chu was born in 1946 to impoverished parents , one of at least nine siblings , in Guangdong , China . To increase their children 's chances of survival , Chan 's birth parents gave away some of their youngest to other families . As a result , Chan was adopted by Chan Fei - nung and his wife , Kung Fan - hung , who were renowned Cantonese opera stars . During the 1960s , Connie Chan was one of Hong Kong cinema 's most beloved teen idols . She made more than 230 films in a variety of genres : from traditional Cantonese opera and wuxia movies to contemporary youth musicals ; action films to comedies ; melodramas and romances . Owing to her popularity she was dubbed \`\` The Movie - Fan Princess '' . Her godfather is actor Cho Tat Wah . She has a son named Dexter Yeung , who stars in the 2008 TVB Series Wasabi Mon Amour and Moonlight Resonance .  - Shenzhen is a major city in Guangdong Province, China. The city is located immediately north of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province.  - Mainland China, also known as the Chinese mainland or simply the mainland, is the geopolitical area under the direct jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It generally excludes the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau; however, it usually includes Hainan. The term \\"mainland China\\", which avoids calling the area simply \\"China\\" and thereby recognizing the founding of the PRC as \\"the\\" \\"China\\", was coined by the Kuomintang (KMT) after receiving control of Taiwan from Japan after World War II. By 1949, the KMT-led Republic of China (ROC) government was defeated in the Chinese Civil War in mainland China and fled to the island of Taiwan where the KMT pledged to \\"retake the Mainland\\". The KMT considers both sides of the Taiwan Strait (including Taiwan), as (one) \\"China\\" and one country, whereas Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) considers only mainland China as \\"China\\" and Taiwan (ROC) as \\"Taiwan\\" and maintains that they are different countries.  - Henan is a province of the People's Republic of China, located in the central part of the country. Its one-character abbreviation is \\"\\" (yù), named after Yuzhou, a Han Dynasty state (\\"zhou\\") that included parts of Henan.

Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory.  - The South China Sea is a marginal sea that is part of the Pacific Ocean, encompassing an area from the Karimata and Malacca Straits to the Strait of Taiwan of around . The area's importance largely results from one-third of the world's shipping sailing through its waters and that it is believed to hold huge oil and gas reserves beneath its seabed.  - Macau (literally: \\"Bay Gate\\"), (in Portuguese, which is still widely used in the city) also spelled Macao (in English), officially the Região Administrativa Especial de Macau da República Popular da China, is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta in East Asia. Macau is bordered by the city of Zhuhai in China to the North and the Pearl River Estuary to the East and South. Hong Kong lies about to its East across the Delta. With a population of 650,900 living in an area of , it is the most densely populated region in the world.  - The Cantonese opera is one of the major categories in Chinese opera, originating in southern China's Guangdong Province. It is popular in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, Macau and among the Chinese community in Southeast Asia. Like all versions of Chinese opera, it is a traditional Chinese art form, involving music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics, and acting. History. There is a debate about the origins of Cantonese opera, but it is generally accepted that opera was brought from the northern part of China and slowly migrated to the southern province of Guangdong in late 13th century, during the late Southern Song dynasty. In the 12th century, there was a theatrical form called the Nanxi or \\"Southern drama\\", which was performed in public theatres of Hangzhou, then capital of the Southern Song. With the invasion of the Mongol army, Emperor Gong of the Song dynasty fled with hundreds of thousands of Song people into Guangdong in 1276. Among them were Nanxi performers from Zhejiang, who brought Nanxi into Guangdong and helped develop the opera traditions in the south.  - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.  - Chinese opera is a popular form of drama and musical theatre in China with roots going back to the early periods in China. It is a composite performance art that is an amalgamation of various art forms that existed in ancient China, and evolved gradually over more than a thousand years, reaching its mature form in the 13th century during the Song Dynasty. Early forms of Chinese drama are simple, but over time they incorporated various art forms, such as music, song and dance, martial arts, acrobatics, as well as literary art forms to become Chinese opera.  - Guangzhou , traditionally romanised as Canton, is the capital and largest city of the Province of Guangdong in southeastern China. Located on the Pearl River about north-northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub.  - Hangzhou, formerly romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in east China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium, due in part to its beautiful natural scenery. The city's West Lake is its best-known attraction.  - Sichuan, formerly romanized as Szechwan, is a province in southwest China occupying most of the Sichuan Basin between the Himalayas on the west, the Daba in the north, and the Yungui Plateau to the east. Sichuan's capital is Chengdu.  - Cantonese, or Standard Cantonese, is a variant of Yue Chinese spoken in the vicinity of Guangzhou (known historically as Canton) in southeastern China. It is the traditional prestige dialect of Yue.  - , formerly romanized as Chekiang, is an eastern coastal province of China. Zhejiang is bordered by Jiangsu province and Shanghai municipality to the north, Anhui province to the northwest, Jiangxi province to the west, and Fujian province to the south; to the east is the East China Sea, beyond which lie the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.  - Acrobatics (from Greek  \\"akrobate\\", \\"walk on tiptoe, strut\\") is the performance of extraordinary feats of balance, agility, and motor coordination. It can be found in many of the performing arts, sports (sporting) events, and martial arts. Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as acro dance, circus, and gymnastics, but many other athletic activities  such as ballet and diving  may also employ acrobatics. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as aerobatics.  - Guangdong (Simplified ) is a province on the South China Sea coast of the People's Republic of China. Formerly romanised as Canton or Kwangtung, Guangdong surpassed Henan and Sichuan to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population. The provincial capital Guangzhou and economic hub Shenzhen are among the most populous and important cities in China. The population increase since the census has been modest, the province at 2014 end had 107,240,000 people.

En los períodos en que Egipto controló Nubia los gobernantes del Nilo construyeron templos allí, tan al sur como Gebel Barkal. La mayoría de ciudades de Egipto tenían un templo, pero en algunos casos, como los templos funerarios o los templos de Nubia, se creaban de nueva planta en tierras antes deshabitadas. El emplazamiento exacto del templo era decidido por motivos religiosos, y podría ser el lugar de nacimiento o enterramiento mítico de un dios. La orientación del templo podía decidirse para alinearlo con lugares de significado religioso, como un templo vecino, el nacimiento del sol o la posición de alguna estrella. Por ejemplo, el gran templo de Abu Simbel, está alineado de tal manera que dos veces al año los rayos del sol naciente iluminan las estatuas de los dioses en el sancta sanctorum.

Experimental compositional practice is defined broadly by exploratory sensibilites radically opposed to, and questioning of, institutionalized compositional, performing, and aesthetic conventions in music . Elements of experimental music include indeterminate music, in which the composer introduces the elements of chance or unpredictability with regard to either the composition or its performance. Artists may also approach a hybrid of disparate styles or incoprorate unorthodox and unique elements .  The practice became prominent in the mid-20th century, particularly in Europe and North America. John Cage was one of the earliest composers to use the term and one of experimental music's primary innovators, utilizing indeterminacy techniques and seeking unknown outcomes. In France, as early as 1953, Pierre Schaeffer had begun using the term \\"\\"\\"\\" to describe compositional activities that incorporated tape music, musique concrète, and elektronische Musik. Also, in America, a quite distinct sense of the term was used in the late 1950s to describe computer-controlled composition associated with composers such as Lejaren Hiller. Harry Partch as well as Ivor Darreg worked with other tuning scales based on the physical laws for harmonic music. For this music they both developed a group of experimental musical instruments. Musique concrète (French; literally, \\"concrete music\\"), is a form of electroacoustic music that utilises acousmatic sound as a compositional resource. Free improvisation or free music is improvised music without any rules beyond the taste or inclination of the musician(s) involved; in many cases the musicians make an active effort to avoid \\"clichés\\", i.e., overt references to recognizable musical conventions or genres.

Given the question: This article: American singer Prudencesa Renfro, professionally known as Pru, was signed through Warner/Chappell Music Publishing by Capitol Records' executive Roy Lott, who said that he was \\"drawn to\\" her songwriting and voice. Jack Ponti, of Cazzy Dog Management, had helped Pru produce a demo tape to secure the record deal. Lott had noted Pru's potential as an artist through her lyrics. He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound, serving as the executive producer for her debut studio album Pru.Prior to securing a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in artists such as Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: \\"From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis.\\" She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track \\"Hazy Shades\\" as an example of a poem turned into a song.Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to contemporary R&B, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio. On her official website, the singer identified her style as connected with the soul. Though AllMusic gives the singer songwriting credit on twelve of the tracks, Pru is only credited for co-writing \\"Aaroma\\" on the album's liner notes.

Article:At least a dozen people were also injured in the incident on Drottninggatan (Queen Street), one of the city's major pedestrian streets, on Friday afternoon. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said it was a terror attack. One man has been arrested, after police released a CCTV image of a person who may be connected to the case. Eyewitnesses describe lorry 'trying to hit people' In a speech on Friday night, Mr Lofven said Swedish values of democracy and freedom would not be \\"undermined by hatred\\". He also announced the country's border controls had been strengthened. The crash happened at the Ahlens department store just before 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT). Witnesses say the lorry drove into the front window. One eyewitness, Annevi Petersson, told the BBC she was in the shop's fitting room when she heard the screams. \\"There was blood everywhere,\\" she said. Swedish brewery Spendrups said its lorry had been stolen on its way to a restaurant delivery earlier in the day. \\"Someone jumped into the driver's cabin and drove off with the vehicle while the driver was unloading,\\" a brewery spokesperson told the TT news agency. The shop sits close to the city's central station, which was evacuated. The metro, central roads and various bus lines were also shut down after the attack. Shots were reportedly fired in another part of the city, but Swedish police told local media there was no connection between the two incidents. City authorities said they had made several spaces, including a number of school buildings, available as temporary accommodation for those who could not get home because of transport disruptions. They have also asked people not to share photographs of the victims online. I was in Stockholm yesterday, ironically at a security conference. I don't think Sweden was prepared for something like this. The last big terror incident they had was in 2010 when a failed suicide bomber blew himself up in a car in central Stockholm.

Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests.  Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B? Answer:","output":"Forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would generally see higher rates of chemical weathering compared to Forest B, the temperate forest in Germany. This is mainly due to a combination of factors, including climate, precipitation, and temperature. In tropical forests like Forest A, there are typically higher average temperatures and higher amounts of precipitation (rainfall) throughout the year. These conditions result in increased humidity and moisture in the area, which can accelerate the process of chemical weathering. Chemical weathering involves the breakdown of rocks, minerals, and soil through chemical processes, and these processes are often enhanced by the presence of water and higher temperatures. In addition to the higher precipitation and temperature, tropical forests have a larger amount of vegetation and biological activity. The presence of additional plant-life and microorganisms contributes to the production of organic acids and humic substances that further promote chemical weathering processes. On the other hand, temperate forests like Forest B in Germany experience relatively lower average temperatures and precipitation levels compared to tropical forests. While these factors still result in some chemical weathering, the rates are generally lower than in the tropical forest, due to the reduced availability of water and less intense temperature regimes. In conclusion, Forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would generally experience higher rates of chemical weathering compared to Forest B, the temperate forest in Germany, primarily due to the differences in climate, precipitation, and temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a tourist resort and a gateway to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. A large part of the town has been designated a conservation area.    What is the relationship between 'river sid' and 'english channel'? The answer is:","output":"The River Sid and the English Channel are related in several ways, primarily through their geographical locations and their influences on the surrounding regions.  1. Geographical Proximity: The River Sid is a minor river in East Devon, which flows southwards through Sidbury, Sidford, and Sidmouth before finally outflowing at the Ham through a shingle bar into the English Channel. The English Channel is a body of water that separates southern England and northern France. It connects the southern part of the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean and is an important regional and international waterway.  2. Hydrological Connection: The River Sid's ultimate destination is the English Channel, as it drains into it after passing through East Devon. The river forms part of a larger network of rivers, streams, and watercourses that contribute to the overall water flow and quality of the English Channel. 3. Influence on Coastal Towns: The River Sid and English Channel are connected through their impact on coastal towns such as Sidmouth. Sidmouth is a tourist resort and a gateway to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. The presence of the River Sid running through Sidmouth and the town's location along the English Channel further enhances the appeal of Sidmouth as a tourist destination. The English Channel provides opportunities for water and beach-related activities, while the River Sid brings a natural charm to the town's landscape and serves as a vital source of water. 4. Impact on the Sid Valley: The River Sid flows through the Sid Valley, an area that is maintained and preserved by the Sid Vale Association, the first Civic Society in Britain, founded in 1846. The Sid Vale Association's efforts ultimately play a role in preserving the natural landscape surrounding the River Sid and preserving the local environment that eventually connects to the English Channel.  5. Ecological Connection: The River Sid and English Channel both play a crucial role in supporting regional ecosystems. The river provides a habitat for various species of flora and fauna and acts as a vital freshwater source for the region. The English Channel is known for its diverse marine life and is home to numerous species of fish, seabirds, marine mammals, and other aquatic organisms. The interaction between these two systems has a significant influence on the overall health of the natural environment in Devon and beyond. In summary, the relationship between the River Sid and the English Channel is defined by their geographical proximity, hydrological connection, influence on coastal towns, impact on the Sid Valley, and their shared ecological role. These various connections make the River Sid and the English Channel important natural features in East Devon and the surrounding regions."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The haunting memories of Hitler's concentration camps and the Soviet Union's murders of Polish officers in Katyn refer to two of the most horrific events that took place during World War II. Both events have left a deep impact on the collective memory of those who were directly or indirectly affected by them. In the case of Hitler's concentration camps, millions of people, primarily Jews, were systematically persecuted, tortured, and killed during the Holocaust. From 1941 to 1945, these camps were used as extermination centers to eliminate \\"undesirable\\" individuals, such as Jews, homosexuals, gypsies, disabled, and dissidents, to name a few. The Nazi regime established a network of concentration camps and extermination centers across German-occupied Europe, with Auschwitz being the most infamous and deadly. The memories of these concentration camps evoke feelings of horror and grief, as victims and survivors often returned to their homes to find their families gone and their communities destroyed. The effects of these camps are still felt today, as both physical and psychological scars remain, and the atrocities committed continue to be a significant subject of study and discussion in order to prevent such horrors from happening again. Similarly, the Soviet Union's murders of Polish officers in Katyń also hold a tragic place in history. In 1940, in the wake of the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, approximately 22,000 Polish military officers, intellectuals, and other members of the elite were executed by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD. These mass executions took place in the Katyń Forest, which is where the event gets its name. These murders were initially denied by the Soviet regime, leading to a long-lasting controversy regarding the truth of the events. The gravity of these two historic events is still felt today, with various memorials and commemorations being held to honor the victims and ensure that these acts are not forgotten. By understanding the depth of human cruelty that took place during these occurrences, the hope is that future generations will be inspired to work toward a world where such atrocities cease to exist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   15.3 Flatworms, Nematodes, and Arthropods Flatworms are acoelomate, triploblastic animals. They lack circulatory and respiratory systems, and have a rudimentary excretory system. The digestive system is incomplete in most species. There are four traditional classes of flatworms, the largely free-living turbellarians, the ectoparasitic monogeneans, and the endoparasitic trematodes and cestodes. Trematodes have complex life cycles involving a secondary mollusk host and a primary host in which sexual reproduction takes place. Cestodes, or tapeworms, infect the digestive systems of primary vertebrate hosts. Nematodes are pseudocoelomate members of the clade Ecdysozoa. They have a complete digestive system and a pseudocoelomic body cavity. This phylum includes free-living as well as parasitic organisms. They include dioecious and hermaphroditic species. Nematodes have a poorly developed excretory system. Embryonic development is external and proceeds through larval stages separated by molts. Arthropods represent the most successful phylum of animals on Earth, in terms of number of species as well as the number of individuals. They are characterized by a segmented body and jointed appendages. In the basic body plan, a pair of appendages is present per body segment. Within the phylum, classification is based on mouthparts, number of appendages, and modifications of appendages. Arthropods bear a chitinous exoskeleton. Gills, tracheae, and book lungs facilitate respiration. Embryonic development may include multiple larval stages.   Q: What phylum has the highest number of species on earth?

Write a title: Intel Corp.'s board of directors Thursday elected current president and chief operating officer (COO) Paul Otellini as the company's next chief executive officer (CEO), succeeding Craig Barrett who was named new chairman of the board.","output":"Title: \\"Intel Corporation Announces Leadership Transition: Paul Otellini Elected as Next CEO, Succeeding Craig Barrett Who Assumes Role as Chairman of the Board\\"  The Intel Corp. Board of Directors convened on Thursday to decide on vital leadership changes, indicating an essential shift in management strategy for the technology giant. In a critical move, they unanimously elected current president and COO, Paul Otellini, to assume the role of CEO, taking the reins from the incumbent, Craig Barrett. As part of this sweeping administrative change, Barrett was named the new chairman of the board, further solidifying Intel's dedication to maintaining a steady and knowledgeable leadership team during this transitional period. It is worth noting that Paul Otellini's extensive experience within the company had undoubtedly played a significant role in this momentous decision. Having joined Intel in 1974, Otellini gradually climbed the ranks in a series of executive positions, eventually being appointed as the president and COO in 2002. Throughout his tenure, he consistently demonstrated exceptional leadership skills, strategic vision, and an unwavering commitment to achieving both short-term and long-term goals, which undoubtedly contributed to the board's confidence in his ability to lead the company through the next chapter of its evolution. As Otellini prepares to take on the immense responsibilities of the chief executive officer, he will be challenged to not only maintain Intel's long-standing dominance in the microprocessor market but to also drive the company into new horizons, exploring untapped opportunities and technological advancements. Moreover, with the increasing pressures of global competition and rapid market changes, Otellini's ability to lead Intel in developing innovative solutions and carving out a distinctive niche in the ever-expanding technological landscape will be under close scrutiny. In his new capacity as chairman of the board, Craig Barrett will continue to be a significant presence within Intel. As a principal architect of Intel's growth and an influential figure in the technology sector, his appointment as chairman ensures the company will have the benefit of his invaluable expertise, industry connections, and an unwavering commitment to quality and innovation. As the new chairman, Barrett will now focus on providing strategic oversight, ensuring corporate governance, and guiding the board in its decision-making capacities for the best interests of the company and its shareholders. Intel's deliberate choice to elevate both Otellini and Barrett to these crucial leadership positions signifies their confidence in the duo's ability to spearhead the company towards future success. As the technology industry continues to evolve at a rapid pace and face novel challenges, the combined leadership of Otellini and Barrett will be instrumental in positioning Intel at the forefront of innovation and sustainable growth. In conclusion, Intel Corporation's recent leadership transition speaks to its commitment to cultivating experienced and dynamic leadership that can guide the company through the challenges of an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing industry landscape.

A school board in the eastern state of Virginia has filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt a ruling that allows a transgender student to use the boys’ restroom next school year. The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August. Question: What does the school board want?

El Nino refers to a climate pattern characterized by the appearance of warmer-than-usual waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, specifically near the coast of Peru. This phenomenon significantly affects global weather patterns as well as the ecosystems and marine life in the affected areas. The paragraph states that El Nino is so named because its effects are most noticeable around Christmas time. The name \\"El Nino\\" comes from Spanish, meaning \\"the little boy\\" or \\"Christ child.\\" Fishermen from Peru and Ecuador originally named it this way in the late 19th century due to its tendency to occur around Christmas.

While the geographical area of El Nino's effects, especially off the coast of Peru, plays a significant role in the naming decision, the association to Christmas is the main reason for its name.

Comeback by Bill Cosby Unravels as Rape Claims Re-emerge In the twilight of a long and celebrated career, Bill Cosby was experiencing the kind of comeback few longtime performers enjoy. A new biography described his life and accomplishments. A stand-up comedy special on Netflix, commemorating his 77th birthday, was set for next week. His collection of African-American art became part of an exhibition at the Smithsonian this month. And NBC was exploring a project that would bring him back to prime time, where in the 1980s he became America’s pre-eminent TV star with “The Cosby Show.” But in recent weeks, his triumphant return to the national stage has fallen apart in the face of a wave of accusations by women who say Mr. Cosby drugged and raped them decades ago. On Wednesday, NBC said it was canceling the pilot project, and the cable network TV Land quietly stopped showing repeats of “The Cosby Show.” Less than 24 hours earlier, Netflix said it was postponing the debut of the comedy special. Other scheduled appearances by Mr. Cosby — on David Letterman’s late-night show and Queen Latifah’s daytime talk show — have also been canceled. Mr. Cosby’s lawyers have vigorously denied the accusations in recent days, and he has never faced criminal charges. But the troubles have put the star’s comeback in limbo and created awkward situations as he seeks to burnish his legacy. Mr. Cosby’s handlers, for instance, realized that Mr. Letterman would have to ask Mr. Cosby about the rape claims, and so scrapped the appearance on the show. During an interview on Nov. 6 with The Associated Press, Bill Cosby refused to respond to allegations of sexual assault after the reporter brought up recent reports. The accusations against Mr. Cosby have been all the more striking because his hit TV show, his commercials for Jell-O and his best-selling books about fatherhood helped him present an image of the ideal family man. A series of suddenly converging factors contributed to tearing that down. They included a viral video of an emerging comedian, Hannibal Buress, who bluntly called Mr. Cosby a rapist in his act, and an ill-conceived effort to solicit positive comments about Mr. Cosby on an Internet meme, which inspired a chorus of contributors to call him a rapist. In the meantime, four women have come forward publicly in recent days to repeat the decades-old accusations of being drugged, raped or molested. The reach of the web and the impact of social media have provided a distribution platform for these accusations, which had surfaced before but never gained widespread traction. Martin Kaplan, the Norman Lear chair in entertainment, media and society at the University of Southern California’s journalism school, said a combination of social media and Mr. Cosby’s return to the spotlight had propelled the story to much greater prominence than when the accusations surfaced in the past. “The fact that he was already in the public spotlight — the book, the potential deal with NBC and so on — and the fact that these charges have a much more powerful amplifier and echo chamber, it gives people the sense that this is a big story,” he said. The current furor surrounding Mr. Cosby had its root in accusations brought in 2005 by Andrea Constand, a female staff member with the basketball team at Temple University, Mr. Cosby’s alma mater. She said she had been drugged and molested by Mr. Cosby. The district attorney at the time in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia, Bruce L. Castor Jr., said in an interview on Wednesday that he did not feel that he had enough evidence to pursue a criminal case at the time, “despite the fact that I thought Cosby was guilty of some improper behavior — my gut told me that.” A subsequent lawsuit brought by Ms. Constand promised to present testimony from 13 “Jane Does” with similar accounts of sexual assault. Mr. Cosby’s lawyer called the claims false and even preposterous; the suit was settled for an undisclosed sum in 2006. One of the unnamed women in the suit, Barbara Bowman, a former actress, came forward publicly in The Washington Post last week to describe her experiences in detail, saying she was drugged and raped by Mr. Cosby in the 1980s. But women had been describing similar episodes with Mr. Cosby in the eight years since the suit was settled. Ms. Bowman spoke about her charges to Philadelphia magazine and People magazine in 2006. Newsweek magazine had interviews with both Ms. Bowman and another accuser, Tamara Green, this February without setting off the whirlwind of attention that has surrounded Mr. Cosby in the last two weeks. But Mr. Cosby’s career was not ascendant at the time. Mark Whitaker, the author of the biography that contributed to the controversy — partly because Mr. Whitaker did not address the rape charges in his book — said Mr. Cosby’s revived career had thrust him back into national attention again. “He was not hiding,” Mr. Whitaker said. “He was on the road doing 60 concerts a year. But in terms of visibility, he was doing things he had not done in quite a while.” Mr. Whitaker, the former top editor at Newsweek, cited events surrounding the 30th anniversary of “The Cosby Show,” the 50th anniversary of the start of Mr. Cosby’s career and two stand-up concert films that Mr. Cosby had planned. Then he agreed to try to return to prime time on NBC. “He was putting himself out there,” Mr. Whitaker said. Mr. Whitaker said his book did not address the accusations because he could not verify them. If the comeback brought Mr. Cosby the adulation of his fans, it also revived the outrage of his accusers. In addition to Ms. Bowman, a writer named Joan Tarshis came forward for the first time to tell a story of being drugged and raped on two occasions in 1969. “I had wanted to get it off my chest for a long time,” Ms. Tarshis said in a telephone interview. “When I was approached by tabloids in 2005, a tabloid was not the way I wanted to go.” The piece by Ms. Bowman inspired her to finally speak out, she said. Janice Dickinson, a well-known former model, added her name to the list of accusers, saying Mr. Cosby brought her to Lake Tahoe in 1982 and drugged and raped her. That charge has drawn the most virulent response; a lawyer for Mr. Cosby, Martin Singer, called Ms. Dickinson’s claim a “fabricated lie.” Another of Mr. Cosby’s lawyers, John P. Schmitt, earlier had made a blanket denial of the charges by the women as “old and discredited.” In some states, for serious sexual crimes, prosecutions would still be timely. But Benjamin Brafman, an experienced criminal defense lawyer who represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said there would be serious obstacles in making any criminal case against Mr. Cosby at this stage because of the passage of time and the lack of forensic evidence. The end of the prospective project with NBC may be the most painful development for the comedian. Several people with knowledge of the project said that it originated when Mr. Cosby approached the network with an idea to return to weekly situation comedy. A deal like that would almost surely include a penalty payment to the comic if the project was terminated early. NBC was excited enough about the prospect that it announced the project to the news media in July, very early in the process. By all accounts, the decision to drop it now was influenced by the news swirling around Mr. Cosby. Many other stars have bounced back from accusations that damaged their reputation, but Mr. Cosby may find that challenging. The harsh judgment of social media will be difficult to overcome, Mr. Kaplan of the University of Southern California said. “Social media is many things, among them it gives people a belief of what people are talking about,” he said, “which is something larger than what they see on television or read in the papers.” An article on Thursday about the effect of accusations of past sexual misbehavior on the current career of the comedian Bill Cosby described incorrectly in some editions the accusations brought in 2005 by Andrea Constand, then an employee at Temple University, Mr. Cosby’s alma mater. She said she had been drugged and molested by Mr. Cosby, not drugged and raped. The article also gave an outdated title for Bruce L. Castor Jr., who commented on the case. He was district attorney in Montgomery County when Ms. Constand made her accusations; he is not the current district attorney. And because of an editing error, the article misstated the time elapsed since Ms. Constand’s suit was settled in 2006. It is eight years, not nine.

Despite Cosby's adamant denials of these accusations, the resulting public outrage forced NBC and Netflix, among other platforms, to cancel his upcoming appearances, leaving the future of Cosby's career uncertain at the moment.  Here is a detailed explanation: At the close of a successful and celebrated career, Bill Cosby seemed poised to make a triumphant return to prominence in the entertainment industry. There were reasons for optimism. A new biography outlined his career, achievements, and personal life. Netflix had planned a stand-up comedy special, celebrating his 77th birthday. His collection of African-American art was part of an exhibition at the Smithsonian, and NBC had even entertained ideas of a project that would return the comedian to primetime television, a platform he had dominated in the 1980s with \\"The Cosby Show.\\" However, these plans were thrown asunder by a wave of rape accusations against Cosby by several women, who claimed that the comedian had drugged and raped them years ago. The accusations were not new – they had surfaced earlier but had failed to gain significant traction. The difference this time was the widespread visibility brought on by the web and the impact of social media. Among the accusers was Andrea Constand, a Temple University staff member. She brought forth accusations in 2005, claiming that Cosby had drugged and molested her. Although the district attorney at the time did not pursue a criminal case due to a lack of evidence, a subsequent lawsuit brought by Constand pledged to bring forth testimonies from 13 other women with similar accounts of sexual assault by Cosby. The suit, fiercely contested by Cosby's lawyer, was settled in 2006 for an undisclosed sum. Despite these and other accusations, Cosby’s comeback seemed unstoppable. In part, this resilience was due to Cosby's cultivated public image of the ideal family man, reinforced by his TV show, endorsements, and books about fatherhood. But the driving force was his influence and power as one of America's revered performers. Unfortunately for Cosby, the revival of his career, which had invigorated his fans, also brought renewed attention to the accusations. The unearthing of the accusations was aided in large part by the internet and social media. A viral video of comedian Hannibal Buress, in which he bluntly labelled Cosby a rapist, and the comedian's own misguided effort to solicit positive comments on a web meme (which backfired spectacularly), breathed life into the accusations. In the fallout, several platforms distanced themselves from Cosby. NBC canceled a proposed pilot project, and TV Land ceased showing reruns of \\"The Cosby Show\\". Less than a day prior, Netflix had postponed the stand-up comedy special. For Cosby, these setbacks could not have come at a worse time. After a lull, Cosby had returned to the limelight with a vengeance, with multiple concerts a year and plans for two stand-up comedy films. However, with these new and old accusations coming to the fore, his triumphal return to the national stage has withered in the face of public outrage, throwing the future of his career into uncertainty."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Tara Brady Kate Livesey pictured three weeks before she died from Sudden Death Syndrome A fit and active nine-year-old girl died suddenly after being struck a previously undetected heart condition while she had a bath. Kate Livesey was found slumped in the water last February after being struck by Sudden Arrthythmic Death Syndrome (SADS), the same condition that affected footballer Fabrice Muamba. She died in hospital two days later. Although Kate’s mother Suzanne, 46, has a history of arrhythmia, Kate, who spent nearly every evening at cubs, swimming lessons or kickboxing, had no warning of the illness. Today, after an inquest recorded a verdict of death by natural causes, Kate’s family said they were campaigning for better research into the causes of SADS and had already raised thousands of pounds towards the hospital unit where the youngster was treated. 'A lot of footballers are getting checked for underlying heart conditions and even","output":"though Kate wasn't a professional athlete, her case highlights the importance of early detection and intervention for everyone,' said Suzanne. 'We were completely unaware of the condition, and it's absolutely devastating to lose a child so suddenly and unexpectedly.' In light of Kate's tragic death, her family has joined forces with SADS-focused charities and organizations to create awareness and advocate for more extensive research into the syndrome's causes and potential preventative measures. One of the primary goals of this collaborative effort is to implement routine screenings for all children, regardless of their involvement in sports or other physical activities. Kate's family and supporters have also called for better educational resources and training programs for medical professionals, teachers, and parents to enable them to recognize the signs of SADS, respond appropriately, and potentially save lives. Increased funding for research is essential to help scientists identify at-risk individuals, develop effective treatments, and ultimately prevent future SADS-related tragedies. So far, thousands of pounds have already been raised towards improving the hospital unit where Kate was treated. Not only will the additional funding improve existing facilities, but it will also be instrumental in developing cutting-edge technology and innovative diagnostic procedures to better serve SADS patients. In this way, Kate's memory will live on, as her story continues to inspire progress in the field of SADS research and treatment. Reflecting on the loss of their daughter, Kate's parents acknowledged the tremendous sadness and grief they experienced, but also expressed hope in the positive change that Kate's legacy will bring about. They take solace in the fact that, through their advocacy efforts and the generous support of the public, more children like their daughter may receive the care they need to prevent further tragic losses. The Livesey family's commitment to raising awareness about Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome and advancing research is a testament to their resilience and determination to make a difference in the lives of others. As more people become aware of SADS and its potentially devastating effects, the chances of preventing similar tragedies will only increase. Kate's story serves as a powerful reminder that early detection, education, and research can save lives and that, together, we can create a brighter future for individuals at risk for SADS."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Given the below context:  The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Really?","output":"The sentiment of this review can primarily be described as negative, given the various points that the reviewer has criticized regarding their experience with Einstein Bagels. Below are the different aspects of the review that contribute to this overall negative sentiment: 1. Decline in quality: The reviewer explicitly states that Einstein Bagels \\"has really gone down the drain,\\" which implies that they believe the quality of the service and products has significantly deteriorated over time. This phrase sets the tone for the entire review and establishes their dissatisfaction with the current state of the business. 2. Mistakes with orders: The reviewer mentions that their order \\"seems to always get messed up.\\" This demonstrates their frustration and dissatisfaction with the accuracy and attention to detail of the employees. This particular aspect could suggest that the reviewer believes there could be a lack of proper training or attention to customer needs. 3. Poor service and quality: The reviewer further emphasizes their disappointment by calling the quality and service \\"terrible.\\" This harsh description indicates a very strong negative sentiment towards various aspects of the business, such as the employees, the food, and the overall customer experience. 4. Limited business hours: The reviewer also expresses frustration with Einstein Bagels' early closing time, stating, \\"And they close at 4. Really?\\" This is another point of dissatisfaction that contributes to the negative sentiment and suggests inconvenience and disappointment in not being able to access the establishment's service during preferred hours. In summary, the sentiment in this review is overwhelmingly negative, as the reviewer focuses on various points of dissatisfaction like the decline in quality, frequent mistakes with their orders, poor service, and limited business hours.

Step 2: Analyze the meaning of \\"hit\\" in each context. Step 3: Compare the meanings to see if they are the same. Step 1: Identify the context of each sentence. (1) \\"He hit her hard in the face.\\" The context here implies a physical act of violence, where one person is causing harm to another person's face. (2) \\"He hit a home run.\\" The context here is related to sports, specifically baseball, where a player successfully strikes the ball with the aim of scoring a home run. Step 2: Analyze the meaning of \\"hit\\" in each context. (1) In the first sentence, \\"hit\\" means to physically strike someone with force, causing harm or pain. (2) In the second sentence, \\"hit\\" means to successfully strike a baseball with a bat, propelling it far enough to allow the batter to circle all bases and score a home run. Step 3: Compare the meanings to see if they are the same. While the word \\"hit\\" in both sentences shares the similarity of making contact, its meaning differs across contexts. In the first sentence, \\"hit\\" refers to an act of violence, whereas, in the second sentence, it refers to a successful action in a sports game.

In that cartoon, Speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted. Despite looking significantly more handsome, Speedy never developed into much of a character. A big hat, tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not a classic character make and that's pretty much all Speedy ever had going for him. Nevertheless, the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studio's latter days. While these early Speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently (rather oddly) paired up with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula. In this self-titled episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat. Although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon, Sylvester's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable. undemanding role of pursuer. This was always a problem in the Tweety cartoons too but Speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear alongside Speedy for many years to come. Despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born. Now, what is this review like? Select from:  (a). negative  (b). positive","output":"This review can be categorized as (a). negative.  The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the character development, storyline, and predictability of the Speedy Gonzalez cartoons, particularly in their later years when he was paired with Daffy Duck. They mention that the character of Speedy has very limited attributes and even go as far as to describe him as \\"detestable\\" and \\"cocky.\\" In addition, the reviewer finds Sylvester's role lacking, as they believe that being a mere pursuer takes away from his potential uniqueness and personality. Furthermore, the reviewer laments the fact that this particular cartoon won an Oscar and paved the way for the creation of more similarly underwhelming shorts featuring Speedy Gonzalez. Overall, the tone and focus of the review are predominantly negative, as the reviewer points out various shortcomings and offers little in the way of praise or appreciation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He bought it for a song.","output":"No, the word \\"song\\" is used to convey different meanings in the given two sentences. Let's break down each sentence to understand the context within which \\"song\\" is used. 1) \\"The song of bullets was in the air.\\" In this sentence, \\"song\\" is used metaphorically to represent the sound or noise made by bullets. This is a poetic expression, where the word \\"song,\\" typically used to describe a piece of music, is employed to evoke a vivid image or atmosphere associated with the sound of bullets flying through the air. In this context, \\"song\\" is not referring to an actual musical composition, but rather, it is being used as a literary device to help readers visualize and understand the intensity of the situation. 2) \\"He bought it for a song.\\" In this sentence, the expression \\"for a song\\" is an idiomatic phrase. It means that the person bought something at a significantly low price, much less than its actual worth or market value. The origin of this idiom is likely connected to the fact that songs or melodies have been historically regarded as inexpensive or intangible. The idiom does not refer to the actual buying of a song or a piece of music. Instead, it's a way of saying that the person bought the item at an incredibly low or cheap price. Moreover, it implies that the buyer got a great deal on the purchase. In summary, the word \\"song\\" is used in different contexts within these two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"song\\" acts as a metaphor for the sound of bullets, while in the second sentence, it is part of an idiomatic expression that conveys the idea of purchasing something at a very low price. Although both sentences use the word \\"song,\\" the meaning significantly differs based on the surrounding context and expressions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Following their road win over the Dolphins, the Cowboys traveled to Soldier Field to play a Sunday night match with the defending NFC Champion Bears.  The game was close early as the Bears' Robbie Gould and the Cowboys' Nick Folk each hit field goals respectively to make it a 3-3 tie at halftime.  The Cowboys took the opening drive of the third quarter and ended it with a Tony Romo to Jason Witten touchdown pass.  The Bears responded on the ensuing drive with a Cedric Benson goal line plunge.  The Cowboys struck again before the end of the third quarter, Romo connecting on his second touchdown pass, this time to running back Marion Barber.  Folk converted a 44-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter, and on the next play from scrimmage, Bears quarterback Rex Grossman threw an interception to Cowboys cornerback Anthony Henry, who ran it back for the score. The Cowboys proceeded to kill the clock, with Barber, who capped the scoring with a one-yard touchdown run.
